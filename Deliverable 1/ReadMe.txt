The Folder "Treaty Texts and Data" contains the whole data set.
Under Ecolex, one can find the original downloads, as well as processed texts for faster HPC usage.
Both Folders contain the meta data of the treaties and treaty decisions as a csv file.
Similarly, under IEA one can find the whole downloaded data and the processed texts for faster HPC use.
The meta data is saved in the IEA folder, however, it is very limited, as the data was provided by
another researcher, who has not made his data public. Hence, the meta data publically available is limited to matching names to file numbers.

Additionally, in this repository two webscraping files can be found. One to re-webscrap the ecolex database, and another one to re-webscrap the IEA database.
