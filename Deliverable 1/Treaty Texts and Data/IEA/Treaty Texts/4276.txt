The Contracting Parties to the present Protocol:
Being Contracting Parties to the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution (Bucharest Convention, 21 April 1992)
Recognising that in recent decades there have been significant human induced changes in the biota and physico-chemical conditions of the Black Sea;
Concerned that threats to biodiversity, such as eutrophication, over-fishing, pollution and introduction of non-native species continue;
Accepting the importance of pollution control in the Black Sea for the conservation of biodiversity and the maintenance and restoration of ecosystem functions;
Recalling that under Article 13 of the Bucharest Convention when taking measures for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine environment of the Black Sea, the Contracting Parties are required to pay particular attention to avoiding harm to marine life and living resources, in particular by changes to their habitats through fishing and other legitimate uses of the sea;
Further recalling that
- Protocol on Protection of the Black Sea Marine Environment against Pollution from Land-based Sources;
- Protocol on Co-operation in Combating Pollution of the Black Sea Marine Environment by Oil and Other Harmful Substances in Emergency Situations
- Protocol on the Protection of the Black Sea Marine Environment Against Pollution by Dumping
are in force under the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea Against Pollution
Recalling that in April 1993 the Environment Ministers from all six Black Sea countries signed a common policy declaration (the Ministerial Declaration on Protection of the Black Sea Against Pollution, Odessa, 1993) in which they agreed:
- To encourage the development of comprehensive and co-ordinated plans for the restoration and conservation of biodiversity in the Black Sea in the spirit of the Convention on Biological Diversity (June 5, 1992, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)
- To take appropriate measures for the restoration and conservation of biodiversity in the Black Sea in the spirit of the Convention on Biological Diversity (June 5, 1992, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)
- To establish and improve nature conservation areas in the coastal zone of each of the coastal states before 1996
Bearing in mind that all of the Black Sea countries have signed and ratified the Convention on Biodiversity (June 5, 1992, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil);
Further bearing in mind that some of the Contracting Parties have also signed and ratified other relevant conventions and agreements, e.g. Convention on Wetlands of International importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (February 2, 1971, Ramsar, Iran), Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES, March 3, 1973, Washington, USA), Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (September 19, 1979, Bern, Switzerland), Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (June 23,1979, Bonn, Germany), Agreement on the Conservation of the Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area, November ( 24, 1996, Monaco, European Landscape Convention (October 20, 2000, Florence, Italy) and Convention to Combat Desertification (October 14, 1994, Paris);
Noting that Black Sea Governments are actively involved in implementation of the Pan European Biodiversity and Landscape Strategy as last modified on July 9, 1998
Reaffirming their commitment to the Strategic Action Plan for the Protection and Rehabilitation of the Black Sea (Chapter B, 31 October 1996);
Accepting that concerted actions by all of the Black Sea coastal states and the states in the basin of the Black Sea, they work in co-operation with, can counteract the multiple threats to biological and landscape diversity;

6 With respect to protected species of flora and their parts and products, the Contracting Parties shall regulate and where appropriate prohibit all forms of destruction and disturbance, including the picking, collecting, cutting, uprooting, possession of, commercial trade in or transport and exhibition for commercial purposes of such species.
7 The Contracting Parties shall endeavour, directly or through the Advisory Group on the Conservation of Biodiversity in the Black Sea, to consult with range states that are not Contracting Parties to the Protocol, with a view to co-ordinating their efforts to manage and protect species on Annex 2.
Article 2
1. The Contracting Parties shall adopt co-operative measures to ensure the protection, conservation and improvement of the flora and fauna listed in Annex 2 to this Protocol relating to the list of threatened species. The list shall be revised shall be every five years and within three years of this Protocol coming into force.
