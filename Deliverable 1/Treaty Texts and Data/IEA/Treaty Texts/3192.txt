PREAMBLE
The Contracting States:
Committed to initiating a new era characterised by the strengthening of cooperation and of the cultural, economic, political, scientific, social and technological relations among themselves;
Convinced that enhanced cooperation among the States, Countries and Territories of the Caribbean, building upon their geographical proximity and historical linkages, will contribute to the future cultural, economic and social development of their peoples transcending their separateness of the past;
Conscious of the need to forge an effective and timely response to the challenges and opportunities presented by the globalisation of the international economy and by the progressive liberalisation of hemispheric trade relations;
Prepared to promote, consolidate and strengthen the regional cooperation and integration process in the Caribbean Region in order to create an enhanced economic space that will contribute to its more competitive participation in international markets and facilitate active and coordinated participation by the region in the various multilateral fora;
Sensitive to the wide disparities in size, population, and levels of development among the States, Countries and Territories of the Caribbean;
Committed to the continued promotion, consolidation and entrenchment, inter alia, of the principles of democracy, rule of law, respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity of states and the right to self-determination of peoples, equality of opportunity and respect for human rights, as the basis for strengthening the friendly relations among the peoples of the Caribbean;
Recognising the importance of the Caribbean Sea which constitutes the common patrimony of the peoples of the Caribbean, and recalling the role it has played in their history and the potential it has to operate as a unifying element in their development;
Convinced of the critical importance of preserving the environment of the region and, in particular, their shared responsibility for the preservation of the environmental integrity of the Caribbean Sea, by deploying the collective capabilities of their peoples in developing and exploiting its resources on an environmentally sound and sustainable basis, in order to enhance the quality of life of present and future generations of Caribbean peoples;
Recalling the decision of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community at its Special Meeting in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, in October 1992, to establish the Association of Caribbean States as a broad framework for the adoption of common positions among the States, Countries and Territories of the Caribbean;
Recalling also the Second CARICOM/Central America Ministerial Conference, held in Kingston, Jamaica, in May 1993, at which the Ministers of both sub-regions welcomed the proposal advanced by the Caribbean Community for the establishment of the Association of Caribbean States aimed at promoting economic integration and functional cooperation in the region;
Recalling further the Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Caribbean Community, the Presidents of the Group of Three and the Vice-President of Suriname, held in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, in October 1993, in which they reiterated their commitment to establish the Association of Caribbean States;
