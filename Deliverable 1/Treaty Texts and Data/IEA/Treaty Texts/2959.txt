Article I
AREA OF APPLICATION
The sphere of application of this Protocol shall be the area of the South-East Pacific [The geographical coverage of this Protocol comprises the 200- mile maritime area of sovereignty and jurisdiction of the High Contracting Parties.] within the 200-mile maritime area of sovereignty and jurisdiction of the High Contracting Parties and waters on the landward side up to the freshwater limit.
The fresh-water limit will be determined by each State Party, in accordance with the relevant technical and scientific criteria.
Article II
SOURCES OF POLLUTION
Marine pollution from land-based sources comprises:
(a) Coastal outfalls or disposal and discharges;
(b) Discharges through rivers, canals and other watercourses, including underground watercourses; and
(c) In general, any other land-based source situated within the territories of the High Contracting Parties, whether through water, through the atmosphere or directly from the coast.
Article III
GENERAL OBLIGATIONS
The High Contracting Parties shall, either individually or through bilateral or multilateral cooperation. endeavour to adopt appropriate measures in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from land-based sources, which results or is likely to result in such deleterious effects as harm to living resources and marine life, hazards to human health, hindrance to marine activities, including fishing and other legitimate uses of the sea, impairment of quality for the use of sea water and reduction of amenities.
The High Contracting Parties shall adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from land-based sources including rivers, estuaries, pipelines and outfall structures, taking into account internationally agreed rules, standards and recommended practices and procedures.
The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to harmonize their policies in this connection at the regional level.
Article IV
OBLIGATIONS IN RESPECT OF ANNEX I
The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to prevent, reduce, control and eliminate in their respective zones within the sphere of application of this Protocol pollution from land-based sources caused by the substances listed in annex I to this Protocol. To this end they shall, jointly or individually, elaborate and implement suitable programmes and measures.
Such programmes and measures shall take into account, for their progressive implementation, the capacity to adapt and reconvert existing installations, the economic capacity of the Parties and their need for development.
Without prejudice to the aim of eliminating discharges of the substances listed in annex I, to the extent that such substances occur, they shall be subject to a system of self-monitoring and control. Authorization by the competent national authorities shall depend upon the levels of such substances, taking into account the harm or deleterious effects which may result in the marine environment.
Article V
OBLIGATIONS IN RESPECT OF ANNEX II
The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour progressively to reduce in their respective zone within the sphere of application of this Protocol pollution from land-based sources caused by the substances or sources listed in annex II to this Protocol. To this end they shall, jointly or individually, elaborate and implement suitable programmes and measures.
Such programmes and measures shall take into account, for their progressive implementation, the capacity to adapt and reconvert existing installations, the economic capacity of the Parties and their need for development.
Discharges of the substances listed in annex II to this Protocol shall be subject to a system of self-monitoring and control. Authorization by the competent national authorities shall depend on the levels of such substances, taking into account the harm or deleterious effects which may result in the marine environment.
Article VI
PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES
The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to formulate and progressively adopt, acting individually or jointly as appropriate, in co-operation with the Executive Secretariat or another competent international organization, as the case may be, rules, standards and common practices and procedures dealing with:
(a) Studies to determine the length, depth and position of coastal outfalls;
(b) Special requirements for effluents necessitating separate treatment;
(c) The quality of sea water necessary to guarantee the preservation of human health, living resources and ecosystems;
(d) The control of products, installations and industrial and other processes causing significant pollution from land-based sources;

Annex II
A. The following substances, families and groups of substances, or sources of pollution, listed not in order of priority for the purposes of article V of this Protocol, have been selected mainly on the basis of criteria used for annex I, while taking into account the fact that they are generally less noxious or are more readily rendered harmless by natural processes and therefore generally affect more limited coastal areas.

11. Substances which have, directly or indirectly, an adverse effect on the oxygen content of the marine environment, especially those which may cause eutrophication.
12. Acid or alkaline compounds of such composition and in such quantity that they may impair the quality of sea water.
13. Substances which, though of a non-toxic nature, may become harmful to the marine environment or may interfere with any legitimate use of the sea owing to the quantities in which they are discharged.
B. The control and strict limitation of the discharge of substances referred to in section A above must be implemented in accordance with annex III.
Annex III
With a view to the issue of an authorization for the discharge of wastes containing substances referred to in annexes I and II of this Protocol, particular account will be taken, as the case may be, of the following factors:
A. CHARACTERISTICS AND COMPOSITION OF THE WASTE
1. Type and size of waste source (e.g. industrial process).
2. Type of waste (origin, average composition).
3. Form of waste (solid, liquid, sludge, slurry).
4. Total amount (volume discharged, e.g. per year).
5. Discharge pattern (continuous, intermittent, seasonally variable, etc.)
6. Concentrations with respect to major constituents, substances listed in annex I, substances listed in annex II, and other substances as appropriate.
7. Physical, technical and biochemical properties of the waste.
B. CHARACTERISTICS OF WASTE CONSTITUENTS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR HARMFULNESS
1. Persistence (physical, chemical, biological) in the marine environment.
2. Toxicity and other harmful effects.
3. Accumulation in biological materials or sediments.
4. Biochemical transformation producing harmful compounds.
5. Adverse effects on the oxygen content and balance.

C. CHARACTERISTICS OF DISCHARGE SITE AND RECEIVING MARINE ENVIRONMENT
1. Hydrographic, meteorological, geological and topographic characteristics of the coastal area.
2. Location and type of discharge (outfall, canal, outlet, etc.) and its relation to other areas (such as amenity areas, spawning, nursery, and fishing areas, shellfish grounds) and other discharges.
3. Initial dilution achieved at the point of discharge into the receiving marine environment.
4. Dispersion characteristics such as effect of currents, tides and wind on horizontal transport and vertical mixing.
5. Receiving water characteristics with respect to physical, chemical, biological and ecological conditions in the discharge area.
6. Capacity of the receiving marine environment to receive waste discharges without undesirable effects.
D. AVAILABILITY OF WASTE TECHNOLOGIES
The methods of waste reduction and discharge for industrial effluents as well as domestic sewage should be selected taking into account the availability and feasibility of:
(a) Alternative treatment processes;
(b) Re-use or elimination methods;
(c) On-land disposal alternatives; and
(d) Appropriate low-waste technologies.
E. POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND SEA-WATER USES
1. Effects on human health through pollution impact on:
(a) Edible marine organisms;
(b) Bathing waters;
(c) Aesthetics.
Discharges of waste containing substances listed in annexes I and II shall be subject to a system of self-monitoring and control by the competent national authorities.
