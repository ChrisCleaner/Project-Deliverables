THE CONTRACTING PARTIES,
DESIRING to establish by joint agreement uniform principles and rules, for the purposes of:
(a) increasing the safety of international carriage of dangerous goods by inland waterways;
(b) contributing effectively to the protection of the environment, by preventing any pollution resulting from accidents or incidents during such carriage; and
(c) facilitating transport operations and promoting international trade,
