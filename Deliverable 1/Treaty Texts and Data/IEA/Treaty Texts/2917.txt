4. Amend Schedule Tables 1 and 2 and reorganise into three tables as shown in Appendix 1 of this document.

6. Revise Schedule Appendix A as shown in Appendix 2 of this document by amending Table 1 and adding Table 2.
B. Legal Revision of the Schedule
CHAPTER I. INTERPRETATION (paragraph 1)
Divide the listing into three parts: baleen whales, toothed whales, and general. Under the first two parts, the various whale species are listed alphabetically. Under the third part the following terms are included, in this order:
"strike" means to penetrate with a weapon used for whaling.
"take" means to flag, buoy or make fast to a whale catcher.
"land" means to retrieve to a factory ship, land station, or other place where a whale can be treated.
"lose" means to either strike or take but not land.
"dauhval" [definition unchanged].
"lactating whale" [definition unchanged].
"small-type whaling" [definition unchanged].
The terms "lost whale" and "whales taken" are deleted from the list of definitions.
CHAPTER II. SEASONS
Re-arrange in following order:
"Factory Ship Operations

"This prohibition will apply for 10 years from 24 October 1979 with the provision for a general review after 5 years, unless the Commission decides otherwise."
Delete paragraph 7 and revise [old] paragraph 8 as follows:
"9. (a) Classification of Areas
Areas relating to Southern Hemisphere baleen whales are those waters between the ice-edge and the equator and between the meridians of longitude listed in Table 1.
(b) Classification of Divisions
Divisions relating to Southern Hemisphere sperm whales are those waters between the ice-edge and the equator and between the meridians of longitude listed in Table 3.

The geographical boundaries for the fin, minke and sei whale stocks in the North Atlantic are:
..."
Delete the numbering of the individual stocks and divisions in [old] paragraphs 8(c) and (d), and amend [old] paragraph 8(d) Sperm Whale Stocks, Eastern Division to read:

For stocks at or above the MSY stock level, the permitted catch shall not exceed 90 percent of the MSY. For stocks between the MSY stock level and 10 percent below that level, the permitted catch shall not exceed ... falls short of the MSY stock level."
Amend [old] paragraph 9(c) to read:
"10. (c) A Protection Stock ... below MSY stock level.
There shall be no commercial whaling on Protection Stocks.
Stocks so classified are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of this Schedule.
Amend [old] paragraph 10 to read:
"11. The number of baleen whales taken in the Southern Hemisphere in the 1980/81 pelagic season and the 1981 coastal season shall not exceed the limits shown in Tables 1 and 2. However, in no circumstances shall the sum of the Area catches exceed the total catch limit for each species."
Revise [old] paragraph 12 to read:
"13. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 10
(i) the taking of 10 humpback whales ... less than 50 gross register tonnage are used for this purpose;
(ii) the taking of bowhead whales from the Bering Sea stock by aborigines is permitted, but only when the meat and products ... consumption by the aborigines, and further provided that:
(1) [as set out in section A5 of this document]
(2) it is forbidden to strike, take or kill calves or any bowhead whale accompanied by a calf.
(b) The taking of gray whales from the Eastern stock in the North Pacific is permitted, but only by aborigines or a Contracting Government on behalf of aborigines, and then only when the meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines. The number of gray whales taken in accordance with this sub-paragraph in 1981 shall not exceed the limit shown in Table 1."

Explanatory Notes
A. Fill in one column for each school chased with number of whales caught by each catcher taking part in the chase; if catchers chase the school but do not catch any whales from it, enter 0; for catchers in fleet which do not chase that school enter X.
B. A school on this form means a group of whales which are sufficiently close together that a catcher having completed handling one whale can start chasing another whale almost immediately without spending time searching. A solitary whale should be entered as a school of 1 whale.
C. A takeable whale is a whale of a size or kind which the catchers would take if possible. It does not necessarily include all whales above legal size, eg, if catchers are concentrating on large whales only these would be counted as takeable.
D. Information about catchers from other expeditions or companies operating on the same school should be recorded under Remarks.
