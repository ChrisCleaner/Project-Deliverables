    ﻿Amendments (via Exchanges of letters) to the Convention On The Protection Of The Rhine Against Pollution By Chlorides
Source: http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201404/volume-1404-I-..., 20130629
The Convention and the exchanges of letters constituting an amendment entered into force on 5 July 1985, the date of receipt by the Government of Switzerland of the last of the notifications in respect of the said exchanges of letters. According to article 14 of the Convention, it should have entered into force on the first day of the second month following receipt by the Government of Switzerland of the last of the notifications by which the Parties confirmed the completion of the required internal procedures. However, France did not immediately approve the Convention in its version of 3 December 1976, but proposed to the other Parties to modify the Convention. The amendment thus proposed was accepted by exchanges of letters between the Parties with the understanding that it would enter into force when all the Contracting Parties had notified the Government of Switzerland of the completion of the required internal procedures for the entry into force of the said exchanges of letters. 
Dates of exchanged letters: at Neuilly on 29 April 1983, at Bonn on 4 May 1983, at The Hague on 4 May 1983, at Luxembourg on 13 May 1983 and at Berne on 13 May 1983.
The notifications in question were effected as follows:

EXCHANGES OF LETTERS

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE, ATTACHED TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER
Neuilly, 29 April 1983
Sir,
With reference to the discussions at the sixth ministerial conference of 17 November 1981, and to the deliberations which have been held since that occasion within the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine against Pollution with a view to updating the Convention on the Protection of the Rhine against Pollution by Chlorides, signed at Bonn on 3 December 1976, I have the honour, on behalf of my Government, to propose the following:
1. Bearing in mind the time periods specified in article 2, paragraph 2, annex I of the Convention may be changed by agreement of the Contracting Parties in the light of the conclusions presented by the scientific committee, whose establishment was announced by the French Party during the sixth ministerial conference, in its report of July 1982, and any conclusions it may draw in future from the additional studies it has recommended. These changes should not entail any nuisance, inconvenience or other consequences for the territory of each of the Contracting Parties.
2. In view of the delay in the entry into force of the Convention, the second phase, which pursuant to article 2, paragraph 3 of the Convention is due to begin on 1 January 1980, will begin within two years following the onset of the initial phase. 
I should be grateful if you would let me know if the foregoing provisions are acceptable to your Government. In such case, this letter and your reply and the identical letters exchanged between the French Government and the three other Governments which are signatories to the Convention shall constitute an Agreement among the five Governments concerned. This Agreement shall be deposited with the Government of the Swiss Confederation by the French Government. It shall enter into force when all the Governments which are signatories to the Convention have notified the Government of the Swiss Confederation of the completion of the procedures necessary for the entry into force of the provisions of this letter and of the identical letters exchanged between the French Government and the other signatory Governments, and when the Convention itself has entered into force.
This Agreement may be denounced under the conditions provided for in article 15 of the Convention. If this Agreement is denounced, the Convention shall also be deemed to be denounced.
Accept, Sir, etc.
