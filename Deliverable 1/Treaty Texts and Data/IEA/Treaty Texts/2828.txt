Source: ST/LEG/SER. B/18 (preliminary issue), pp. 146
The Parties to this Arrangement,
Realizing that the scientific evidence available calls for immediate measures for the purpose of conservation of fish stocks in the Faroe Area (ICES Statistical Division Vb),
Considering the exceptional dependence of the Faroese economy on fisheries, and
Recognizing that the Faroe Islands should enjoy preference in waters surrounding the Faroe Islands,
Have agreed as follows:

Article 2. 
1. Contracting Parties directing their fisheries in the area solely towards demersal species other than those covered by article I shall not conduct their demersal fisheries in a way significantly different from those of the years 1968 to 1972.
Their annual catches from trawl fisheries shall not exceed by more than 10% the highest figure they have respectively achieved in those years as recorded by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.
2. The annual catches of Parties to whom paragraph 1 applies and whose fleets fish solely by line and gillnets in the area, shall not exceed by more than 25% the highest figure achieved over the years 1968 to 1972 as recorded by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.
3. Contracting Parties which have not habitually exercised fishing in the area shall limit their annual catches of demersal species mentioned in paragraph 1 to a maximum of 2,000 tons each.

1. for the following annual quantities of demersal stocks:
In sub-area 2: 1,250 tons 
In sub-area 3: 1,250 tons 
In sub-area 4: 500 tons.
These quotas form part of the total Faroese quota according to the catch limitation scheme annexed hereto.
Article 5. Nothing in the present Arrangement shall be deemed to prejudice the views of any Contracting Party as to the delimitation and limits in international law of territorial waters, adjacent zones or of jurisdiction in fishery matters.
Article 6. 1. The present Arrangement shall enter into force on January 1, 1974.
2. Any Contracting Party may request a review of the Arrangement.
