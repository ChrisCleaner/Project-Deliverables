Source: http://www.cep.unep.org/pubs/legislation/cartxt.php, 20040811
The Contracting Parties,
Fully aware of the economic and social value of the marine environment, including coastal areas, of the wider Caribbean region,
Conscious of their responsibility to protect the marine environment of the wider Caribbean region for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations,
Recognizing the special hydrographic and ecological characteristics of the region and its vulnerability to pollution,
Recognizing further the threat to the marine environment, its ecological equilibrium, resources and legitimate uses posed by pollution and by the absence of sufficient integration of an environmental dimension into the development process,
Considering the protection of the ecosystems of the marine environment of the wider Caribbean region to be one of their principal objectives,
Realizing fully the need for co-operation amongst themselves and with competent international organizations in order to ensure co-ordinated and comprehensive development without environmental damage,
Recognizing the desirability of securing the wider acceptance of international marine pollution agreements already in existence,
Noting however, that, in spite of the progress already achieved, these agreements do not cover all aspects of environmental deterioration and do not entirely meet the special requirements of the wider Caribbean region,
Have agreed as follows:
