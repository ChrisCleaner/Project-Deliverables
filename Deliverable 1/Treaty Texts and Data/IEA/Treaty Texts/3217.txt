Regulation I/3
Principles governing near-coastal voyages
1 Any Party defining near-coastal voyages for the purpose of the Convention shall not impose training, experience or certification requirements on the seafarers serving on board the ships entitled to fly the flag of another Party and engaged on such voyages in a manner resulting in more stringent requirements for such seafarers than for seafarers serving on board ships entitled to fly its own flag. In no case shall any such Party impose requirements in respect of seafarers serving on board ships entitled to fly the flag of another Party in excess of those of the Convention in respect of ships not engaged on near-coastal voyages.
2 With respect to ships entitled to fly the flag of a Party regularly engaged on near-coastal voyages off the coast of another Party, the Party whose flag the ship is entitled to fly shall prescribe training, experience and certification requirements for seafarers serving on such ships at least equal to those of the Party off whose coast the ship is engaged, provided that they do not exceed the requirements of the Convention in respect of ships not engaged on near-coastal voyages. Seafarers serving on a ship which extends its voyage beyond what is defined as a near-coastal voyage by a Party and enters waters not covered by that definition shall fulfil the appropriate competency requirements of the Convention.
3 A Party may afford a ship which is entitled to fly its flag the benefits of the near-coastal voyage provisions of the Convention when it is regularly engaged off the coast of a non-Party on near-coastal voyages as defined by the Party.
4 Parties defining near-coastal voyages, in accordance with the requirements of this regulation, shall communicate to the Secretary-General, in conformity with the requirements of regulation I/7, the details of the provisions adopted.
5 Nothing in this regulation shall, in any way, limit the jurisdiction of any State, whether or not a Party to the Convention.
Regulation I/4
Control procedures
1 Control exercised by a duly authorized control officer under Article X shall be limited to the following:
.1 verification in accordance with Article X(1) that all seafarers serving on board who are required to be certificated in accordance with the Convention hold an appropriate certificate or a valid dispensation, or provide documentary proof that an application for an endorsement has been submitted to the Administration in accordance with regulation I/10, paragraph 5;
.2 verification that the numbers and certificates of the seafarers serving on board are in conformity with the applicable safe manning requirements of the Administration; and
.3 assessment, in accordance with section A-I/4 of the STCW Code, of the ability of the seafarers of the ship to maintain watchkeeping standards as required by the Convention if there are clear grounds for believing that such standards are not being maintained because of any of the following have occurred:
.3.1 the ship has been involved in a collision, grounding or stranding, or
.3.2 there has been a discharge of substances from the ship when underway, at anchor or at berth which is illegal under any international convention, or
.3.3 the ship has been manoeuvred in an erratic or unsafe manner whereby routeing measures adopted by the Organization or safe navigation practices and procedures have not been followed, or
.3.4 the ship is otherwise being operated in such a manner as to pose a danger to persons, property or the environment.
2 Deficiencies which may be deemed to pose a danger to persons, property or the environment include the following:
.1 failure of seafarers to hold a certificate, to have an appropriate certificate, to have a valid dispensation or to provide documentary proof that an application for an endorsement has been submitted to the Administration in accordance with regulation I/10, paragraph 5;
.2 failure to comply with the applicable safe manning requirements of the Administration;
.3 failure of navigational or engineering watch arrangements to conform to the requirements specified for the ship by the Administration;
.4 absence in a watch of a person qualified to operate equipment essential to safe navigation, safety radiocommunications or the prevention of marine pollution; and
.5 inability to provide for the first watch at the commencement of a voyage and for subsequent relieving watches persons who are sufficiently rested and otherwise fit for duty.
3 Failure to correct any of the deficiencies referred to in paragraph 2, in so far as it has been determined by the Party carrying out the control that they pose a danger to persons, property or the environment, shall be the only grounds under Article X on which a Party may detain a ship.
Regulation I/5
National provisions
1 Each Party shall establish processes and procedures for the impartial investigation of any reported incompetency, act or omission, that may pose a direct threat to safety of life or property at sea or to the marine environment, by the holders of certificates or endorsements issued by that Party in connection with their performance of duties related to their certificates and for the withdrawal, suspension and cancellation of such certificates for such cause and for the prevention of fraud.
2 Each Party shall prescribe penalties or disciplinary measures for cases in which the provisions of its national legislation giving effect to the Convention are not complied with in respect of ships entitled to fly its flag or of seafarers duly certificated by that Party.
3 In particular, such penalties or disciplinary measures shall be prescribed and enforced in cases in which:
.1 a company or a master has engaged a person not holding a certificate as required by the Convention;
.2 a master has allowed any function or service in any capacity required by these regulations to be performed by a person holding an appropriate certificate, to be performed by a person not holding the required certificate, a valid dispensation or having the documentary proof required by regulation I/10, paragraph 5; or
.3 a person has obtained by fraud or forged documents an engagement to perform any function or serve in any capacity required by these regulations to be performed or filled by a person holding a certificate or dispensation.
4 A Party, within whose jurisdiction there is located any company which, or any person who, is believed on clear grounds to have been responsible for, or to have knowledge of, any apparent non-compliance with the Convention specified in paragraph 3, shall extend all cooperation possible to any Party which advises it of its intention to initiate proceedings under its jurisdiction

.2 seafarers are not trained for specific shipboard arrangements in such a way as would impair their ability to take their skills elsewhere.
3 In issuing any certificate under the provisions of this Chapter the following principles shall be taken into account:
.1 the issue of alternative certificates shall not be used in itself:
.1 to reduce the number of crew on board,
.2 to lower the integrity of the profession or "de-skill" seafarers, or
.3 to justify the assignment of the combined duties of the engine and deck watchkeeping officers to a single certificate holder during any particular watch; and
.2 the person in command shall be designated as the master; and the legal position and authority of the master and others shall not be adversely affected by the implementation of any arrangement for alternative certification.
4 The principles contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this regulation shall ensure that the competency of both deck and engineer officers is maintained.
CHAPTER VIII

Regulation VIII/2
Watchkeeping arrangements and principles to be observed
1 Administrations shall direct the attention of companies, masters, chief engineer officers and all watchkeeping personnel to the requirements, principles and guidance set out in the STCW Code which shall be observed to ensure that a safe continuous watch or watches appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions are maintained in all seagoing ships at all times.
2 Administrations shall require the master of every ship to ensure that watchkeeping arrangements are adequate for maintaining a safe watch or watches, taking into account the prevailing circumstances and conditions and that, under the master's general direction:
.1 officers in charge of the navigational watch are responsible for navigating the ship safely during their periods of duty, when they shall be physically present on the navigating bridge or in a directly associated location such as the chartroom or bridge control room at all times;
.2 radio operators are responsible for maintaining a continuous radio watch on appropriate frequencies during their periods of duty;
.3 officers in charge of an engineering watch, as defined in the STCW Code and under the direction of the chief engineer officer, shall be immediately available and on call to attend the machinery spaces and, when required, shall be physically present in the machinery space during their periods of responsibility; and
