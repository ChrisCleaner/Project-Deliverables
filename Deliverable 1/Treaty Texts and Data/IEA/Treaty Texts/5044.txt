15 Paragraph 1.3.10 is replaced by the following:
"1.3.10 Marine diesel engine means any reciprocating internal combustion engine operating on liquid or dual fuel, to which regulation 13 applies, including booster/compound systems, if applied.
Where an engine is intended to be operated normally in the gas mode, i.e. with the gas fuel as the main fuel and with liquid fuel as the pilot or balance fuel, the requirements of regulation 13 have to be met only for this operation mode. Operation on pure liquid fuel resulting from restricted gas supply in cases of failures shall be exempted for the voyage to the next appropriate port for the repair of the failure."
Chapter 5 – Procedures for NOx emission measurements on a test bed
16 Existing paragraph 5.3.4 is deleted and new paragraphs 5.3.4, 5.3.5 and 5.3.6 are added after existing paragraph 5.3.3 as follows:
"5.3.4 The selection of gas fuel for testing for dual fuel depends on the aim of tests. In case where an appropriate standard gas fuel is not available, other gas fuels shall be used with the approval of the Administration. A gas fuel sample shall be collected during the test of the parent engine. The gas fuel shall be analysed to give fuel composition and fuel specification.
5.3.5 fuel temperature shall be measured and recorded together with the measurement point position.
5.3.6 mode operation of dual fuel engines using liquid fuel as pilot or balance fuel shall be tested using maximum liquid-to-gas fuel ratio, such maximum ratio means for the different test cycle modes the maximum liquid-to-gas setting certified. The liquid fraction of the fuel shall comply with 5.3.1, 5.3.2 and 5.3.3."
17 A new sentence is added at the end of existing paragraph 5.12.3.3, as follows:

Chapter 6 – Procedures for demonstrating compliance with NOx emission limits on board
19 Paragraph 6.3.1.4 is replaced by the following:
"6.3.1.4 In practical cases, it is often impossible to measure the fuel oil consumption once an engine has been installed on board a ship. To simplify the procedure on board, the results of the measurement of the fuel oil consumption from an engine's pre-certification test-bed testing may be accepted. In such cases, especially concerning residual fuel oil operation (RM-grade fuel oil according to ISO 8217:2005) and dual fuel operation, an estimation with a corresponding estimated error shall be made. Since the fuel oil flow rate used in the calculation ( ) must relate to the fuel oil composition determined in respect of the fuel sample drawn during the test, the measurement of from the test-bed testing shall be corrected for any difference in net calorific values between the test bed and test fuel oils and gases. The consequences of such an error on the final emissions shall be calculated and reported with the results of the emission measurement."
20 In paragraph 6.3.2.1, table 6 is replaced by the following:

"6.3.4.3 In case of a dual fuel engine, the gas fuel used shall be the gas fuel available on board."
22 Paragraph 6.3.11.2 is replaced by the following:
"6.3.11.2 The NOX emission of an engine may vary depending on the ignition quality of the fuel oil and the fuel-bound nitrogen. If there is insufficient information available on the influence of the ignition quality on the NOX formation during the combustion process and the fuel-bound nitrogen conversion rate also depends on the engine efficiency, an allowance of 10% may be granted for an on board test run carried out on an RM-grade fuel oil (ISO 8217:2005), except that there will be no allowance for the pre-certification test on board. The fuel oil and gas fuel used shall be analysed for its composition of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur and, to the extent given in (ISO 8217:2005) and (ISO 8178-5:2008), any additional components necessary for a specification of the fuel oil and gas fuel."
