At its 38th Annual Meeting held in Malmo, Sweden, 9-13 June 1986, the International Whaling Commission adopted the following amendments to the Schedule (changes underlined):

2. Revise paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3, by substitution of the dates 1986/87 pelagic season, 1987 coastal season, 1967 season, or 1987 as appropriate [also referred to in paragraphs 10(a), (b) and (c)].

4. Amend paragraph 13(b)(3) to read as follows:
‘The taking by aborigines of minke whales from the West Greenland and Central stocks and fin whales from the West Greenland stock is permitted and then only when the meat and products are to be used exclusively for local consumption. The number of whales taken in accordance with this sub-paragraph shall not exceed the limits shown in Table 1.'
5. Amend Table 1 to reflect the aboriginal catch limit of 12 for the Central Stock of minke whales, with a footnote ‘Available to be taken by aborigines pursuant to paragraph 13(b)(3).'
These amendments become effective with respect to each Contracting Government ninety days following the date of this letter, in accordance with Article V of the Convention, unless any Contracting Government lodges an objection, in which case the procedure under Article V, paragraph 3 of the Convention will be followed.
The ninety days period will expire on 30 September 1986. ln the absence of objections by that date the amendments will become effective. Contracting Governments will be notified accordingly.

CIRCULAR COMMUNICATION TO CONTRACTING GOVERNMENTS (and copy to Commissioners) Amendments to the Schedule - Correction
The Secretary regrets that the notification of the Amendments to the Schedule adopted by the Commission at its 38th Annual Meeting (Circular Communication dated 2 July 1986, ref: RG/VJH/16130) contains an error.
The first amendment, the classification of the Okhotsk Sea-West Pacific Stock of minke whales in the North Pacific, should be changed to reflect the fact that it was agreed that this stock should be unclassified.
The Secretary apologises for this mistake.
Dr R. Gambell Secretary to the Commission
