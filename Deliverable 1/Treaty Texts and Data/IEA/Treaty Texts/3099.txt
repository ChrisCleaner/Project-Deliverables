OIL RECORD BOOK - PART II
INTRODUCTION
The following pages of this section show a comprehensive list of items of cargo and ballast operations which are, when appropriate, to be recorded in the Oil Record Book in accordance with Regulation 20 of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78). The items have been grouped into operational sections, each of which is denoted by a code letter.
When making entries in the Oil Record Book, the date, operational code and item number shall be inserted in the appropriate columns and the required particulars shall be recorded chronologically in the blank spaces.
Each completed operation shall be signed for and dated by the officer or officers in charge. Each completed page shall be countersigned by the master of the ship. In respect of the oil tankers engaged in specific trades in accordance with Regulation 13C of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78, appropriate entry in the Oil Record Book shall be endorsed by the competent Port State authority.*
The Oil Record Book contains many references to oil quantity. The limited accuracy of tank measurement devices, temperature variations and clingage will affect the accuracy of these readings. The entries in the Oil Record Book should be considered accordingly.

* This sentence should only be inserted for the Oil Record Book of a tanker engaged in a specific trade.
