APPENDIX III
CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES FOR DESIGNATION OF SOX EMISSION CONTROL AREAS
(Regulation 14)
1 OBJECTIVES
1.1 The purpose of this Appendix is to provide the criteria and procedures for the designation of SOx Emission Control Areas. The objective of SOx Emission Control Areas is to prevent, reduce and control air pollution from SOx emissions from ships and their attendant adverse impacts on land and sea areas.
1.2 A SOx Emission Control Area should be considered for adoption by the Organization if supported by a demonstrated need to prevent, reduce and control air pollution from SOx emissions from ships.
2 PROPOSAL CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION OF A SOx EMISSION CONTROL AREA
2.1 A proposal to the Organization for designation of a SOx Emission Control Area may be submitted only by contracting States to the Protocol of 1997. Where two or more contracting States have a common interest in a particular area, they should formulate a coordinated proposal.
2.2 The proposal shall include:
.1 a clear delineation of the proposed area of application of controls on SOx emissions from ships, along with a reference chart on which the area is marked;
.2 a description of the land and sea areas at risk from the impacts of ship SOx emissions;
.3 an assessment that SOx emissions from ships operating in the proposed area of application of the SOx emission controls are contributing to air pollution from SOx, including SOx deposition, and their attendant adverse impacts on the land and sea areas under consideration. Such assessment shall include a description of the impacts of SOx emissions on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, areas of natural productivity, critical habitats, water quality, human health, and areas of cultural and scientific significance, if applicable. The sources of relevant data including methodologies used, shall be identified;
.4 relevant information pertaining to the meteorological conditions in the proposed area of application of the SOx emission controls and the land and sea areas at risk, in particular prevailing wind patterns, or to topographical, geological, oceanographic, morphological or other conditions that may lead to an increased probability of higher localized air pollution or levels of acidification;
.5 the nature of the ship traffic in the proposed SOx Emission Control Area, including the patterns and density of such traffic; and
.6 a description of the control measures taken by the proposing contracting State or contracting States addressing land-based sources of SOx emissions affecting the area at risk that are in place and operating concurrent with the consideration of measures to be adopted in relation to provisions of Regulation 14 of Annex VI of the present Convention.
2.3 The geographical limits of an SOx Emission Control Area will be based on the relevant criteria outlined above, including SOx emission and deposition from ships navigating in the proposed area, traffic patterns and density, and wind conditions.
2.4 A proposal to designate a given area as an SOx Emission Control Area should be submitted to the Organization in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the Organization.
3 PROCEDURES FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND ADOPTION OF SOx EMISSION CONTROL AREAS BY THE ORGANIZATION
3.1 The Organization shall consider each proposal submitted to it by a contracting State or contracting States.
3.2 A SOx Emission Control Area shall be designated by means of an amendment to this Annex, considered, adopted and brought into force in accordance with Article 16 of the present Convention.
3.3 In assessing the proposal, the Organization shall take into account the criteria which are to be included in each proposal for adoption as set forth in Section 2 above, and the relative costs of reducing sulphur depositions from ships when compared with land-based controls. The economic impacts on shipping engaged in international trade should also be taken into account.
4 OPERATION OF SOx EMISSION CONTROL AREAS
4.1 Parties which have ships navigating in the area are encouraged to bring to the Organization any concerns regarding the operation of the area.
