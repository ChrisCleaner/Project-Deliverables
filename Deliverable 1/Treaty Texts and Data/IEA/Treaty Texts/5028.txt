Article 4
Participation
Participation in the activities on the Testing Ground for the Baltic Sea Region is open to public and private legal entities in Baltic Sea Region States that are Parties to this Agreement.
Article 5
Project Implementation
The Parties encourage business, industries, energy utilities, financial institutions, regional and local authorities to take an active role in identification and implementation of Joint Implementation projects within the framework of the Testing Ground. Such projects are to be carried out in the Baltic Sea Region.
In order to foster and contribute to the implementation of JI projects and to fulfil the Objectives of this Agreement, a Testing Ground Facility (TGF) is being established. The Testing Ground Facility will serve as a multilateral financing instrument for JI projects under this Agreement.
Article 6
Criteria, Approval and Registration of Projects
All Projects implemented under this Agreement shall be carried out in the Baltic Sea Region and shall be approved by the Investor Party and Host Party in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol and the relevant rules, decisions and guidelines thereunder. A written approval shall be issued either by the Testing Ground Facility and the Host Party or by the Investor Party/Parties and the Host Party. Before a written approval is issued, project owners shall demonstrate how the proposed project will contribute to the objectives of the Testing Ground.
The co-operation within the Testing Ground shall focus on energy-related climate change mitigation projects especially in the fields of energy saving, energy efficiency, fuel switching in combination with energy efficiency or saving and renewable energy sources.
The Testing Ground shall also be open to the projects implemented by legal entities in Parties without financing through the TGF, under the precondition that they are compatible with this Agreement and contribute to the objectives of this Agreement by participating in capacity building and exchange of information. After the written approval has been issued, Participating projects shall be registered with the Testing Ground Committee to be established under Article 11 of this Agreement.
It is recommended that all the projects to be implemented under this Agreement to the extent appropriate follow the guidance given in the BASREC Regional Handbook on Procedures for Joint Implementation in the Baltic Sea Region developed for the Testing Ground of the Baltic Sea Region.
Article 7
Project Validation and Verification
Emission reductions generated by the projects shall be subject to verification in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol and the relevant rules, decisions and guidelines hereunder. The verification process entails the validation of the amount of the emission reductions generated by the project during a specified time period. Verification shall be carried out pursuant to the verification procedures established under the Kyoto Protocol either by an independent entity under the Testing Ground Committee or by the Host Party. Emission reductions generated by the projects prior to the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol shall be verified by an independent entity. Verification by a Host Party may be conducted during the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and thereafter provided that the host party meets the eligibility requirements under the Kyoto Protocol and the relevant rules, decisions and guidelines thereunder.
Whenever the Host Party is entitled to verify the emission reductions, the Investor Party/Parties may still require that emission reductions are verified by an independent entity.
The Parties to this Agreement shall undertake the necessary steps for issuance of ERUs and AAUs corresponding to the verified amount of emissions reductions.
Article 8
Transfer of Credits
The Parties shall ensure the timely transfer of ERUs and AAUs accruing from the projects from the Host Party to the Investor Party/Parties in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol and the relevant rules, decisions and guidelines thereunder.
The transfer of the verified ERUs and AAUs shall be based on the written approval issued by the Host Party under Article 6 of this Agreement.
The Host Party shall transfer the verified amount of credits accruing from the projects to the Investor Party/Parties as ERUs under Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol or AAUs under Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol. Credits from emission reductions can also be facilitated through forward sales of AAUs or ERUs as agreed/indicated by the project participants.
Article 9
Capacity Building
The Parties agree to work together to build capacity and competence regarding the Kyoto Mechanisms in the public and private sectors to facilitate co-operation in this field, i.e. through arranging workshops, seminars and conferences. The BASREC Regional Handbook on Procedures for Joint Implementation in the Baltic Sea Region has been developed as a contribution to common understanding of JI concepts, the JI project cycle and to capacity building.
Article 10
