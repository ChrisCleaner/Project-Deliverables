The Contracting Parties
CONSIDERING that the Contracting Parties have a mutual interest in co-operating on an international basis with each other in respect of the safety of nuclear reactors and believe that research on nuclear safety can be improved by encouraging and extending wherever practical the present exchange of technical information among the Contracting Parties;
CONSIDERING that the Contracting Parties, being either governments or parties proposed by their respective governments pursuant to Article III of the Guiding Principles for Co-operation in the Field of Energy Research and Development adopted by the Governing Board of the International Energy Agency (the "Agency") on 28th July, 1975, wish to take part in the Technical Exchange of Information in the Field of Reactor Safety Research and Development (the "Technical Exchange") as provided in this Agreement;
CONSIDERING that the Contracting Parties which are governments and the governments of the other Contracting Parties (referred to collectively as the "Governments") participate in the Agency and have agreed in Article 41 of the Agreement on an Inter-national Energy Program (the "I.E.P. Agreement") [1] to undertake national programmes and to promote the adoption of co-operative programmes in the areas set out in Article 42 of the I.E.P. Agreement, including the area of energy research and development in reactor safety;
CONSIDERING that in the Governing Board of the Agency on 28th July, 1975, the Governments approved the Technical Exchange as a special activity under Article 65 of the I.E.P. Agreement;
CONSIDERING that the Agency has recognised the establishment of the Technical Exchange as an important component of international co-operation in. the field of reactor safety research and development;
CONSIDERING that the Nuclear Energy Agency ("NEA") of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") has agreed to assist in carrying out the Technical Exchange;
HAVE AGREED as follows:
Article 1
OBJECTIVES
(a) The Contracting Parties agree to exchange technical information related to research in reactor safety in their respective countries and in international organisations, by appropriate means such as the following: contribution to the Nuclear Safety Research Index of the Agency and the NEA, exchange of technical and progress reports and joint meetings of experts.
(b) Each Contracting Party is encouraged to exchange with all other Contracting Parties such additional information in the field of reactor safety research as may be in its possession or available to it, and which it has the right to disclose, in such specific detail as it may determine to be appropriate.
(c) The obligations of the Contracting Parties under this Agreement may be further implemented by other multilateral or bilateral exchange agreements which are undertaken to enhance more comprehensive co-operation in projects of specific mutual interest.
(d) The Contracting Parties support the widest possible dissemination of information developed under this Agreement to all States which participate in the International Energy Program as participating countries of the Agency ("Agency Participating Countries") subject to the need to protect intellectual property and to the following limitations:
(1) No Contracting Party shall be required to provide information treated as proprietary or privileged under the laws of its own country;
(2) In respect of any information exchanged or transferred between Contracting Parties, the Contracting Party transmitting such information shall not be held to warrant the suitability of such information for any particular use or application; and
(3) Any information transmitted under this Agreement and which is subject to limited dissemination in order to protect intellectual property, should be appropriately marked and identified, and such information so marked shall not be published by the recipient Contracting Parties without the consent of the originating Party, except as required by a final order of a judicial or other body having the right so to order.
Article 2
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
(a) With respect to intellectual property made, conceived, or developed from information transmitted under this Agreement by personnel of a recipient Contracting Party or by any person receiving such information from a recipient Contracting Party, which intellectual property was made, conceived, or developed, as a direct result of the information received ("resulting intellectual property"), the recipient Contracting Party or its Government shall determine the allocation of all rights to such resulting intellectual property in all countries; provided however that the Contracting Party transmitting the original information shall, without prejudice to any rights of inventors under the national law of the recipient Contracting Party, be granted a non-exclusive licence (with the right to sub-license) to such resulting intellectual property in all countries of the Contracting Parties other than the country of the making, conceiving, or developing Contracting Party for use in the production or utilisation of special nuclear material or atomic energy.
(b) Each Contracting Party will take all necessary steps to protect and respect intellectual property and protect proprietary information in accordance with the laws of its respective country and international law.
(c) Each Contracting Party shall, without prejudice to any rights of inventors under its national law, provide all necessary co-operation from its authors and inventors required to carry out the provisions in this Agreement regarding intellectual property.

Article 3
IMPLEMENTATION
(a) Each Contracting Party shall appoint one or more co-ordinators whose duty it will be to develop and co-ordinate the arrangements and procedures for implementing an effective exchange of information under this Agreement. A co-ordinator or co-ordinators may be appointed for each reactor type.
(b) Each Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Parties and the Executive Director of the Agency of the co-ordinator or co-ordinators chosen to represent it.
(c) The co-ordinators shall organise at least one annual meeting and such other meetings as may be mutually agreed upon to consider past achievements, problems, methods for improving the effectiveness of this Agreement and the design of future programmes, all with the objective of improving the exchange of information.
