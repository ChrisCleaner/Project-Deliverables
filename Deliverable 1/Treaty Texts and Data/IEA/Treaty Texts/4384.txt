This survey shall be such as to ensure that the equipment, systems, fittings, arrangements and material fully comply with the applicable requirements of this Annex;
(b) A renewal survey at intervals specified by the Administration, but not exceeding five years, except where regulation 9(2), 9(5), 9(6) or 9(7) of this Annex is applicable.

9. The existing regulation 9 is replaced by the following:
"(1) An International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate shall be issued for a period specified by the Administration, which shall not exceed five years.
(2) (a) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (1) of this regulation, when the renewal survey is completed within three months before the expiry date of the existing certificate, the new certificate shall be valid from the date of completion of the renewal survey to a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate.
(b) When the renewal survey is completed after the expiry date of the existing certificate, the new certificate shall be valid from the date of completion of the renewal survey to a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate.
(c) When the renewal survey is completed more than three months before the expiry date of the existing certificate, the new certificate shall be valid from the date of completion of the renewal survey to a date not exceeding five years from the date of completion of the renewal survey.
(3) If a certificate is issued for a period of less than five years, the Administration may extend the validity of the certificate beyond the expiry date to the maximum period specified in paragraph (1) of this regulation, provided that the surveys referred to in regulations 5(1)(c) and 5(1)(d) of this Annex applicable when a certificate is issued for a period of five years are carried out as appropriate.

(5) If a ship, at the time when a certificate expires, is not in a port in which it is to be surveyed, the Administration may extend the period of validity of the certificate but this extension shall be granted only for the purpose of allowing the ship to complete its voyage to the port in which it is to be surveyed, and then only in cases where it appears proper and reasonable to do so. No certificate shall be extended for a period longer than three months, and a ship to which an extension is granted shall not, on its arrival in the port in which it is to be surveyed, be entitled by virtue of such extension to leave that port without having a new certificate. When the renewal survey is completed, the new certificate shall be valid to a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted.

When the renewal survey is completed, the new certificate shall be valid to a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted.
(7) In special circumstances, as determined by the Administration, a new certificate need not be dated from the date of expiry of the existing certificate as required by paragraph (2)(b), (5) or (6) of this regulation. In these special circumstances, the new certificate shall be valid to a date not exceeding five years from the date of completion of the renewal survey.
(8) If an annual or intermediate survey is completed before the period specified in regulation 5 of this Annex, then:
(a) the anniversary date shown on the certificate shall be amended by endorsement to a date which shall not be more than three months later than the date on which the survey was completed;
(b) the subsequent annual or intermediate survey required by regulation 5 of this Annex shall be completed at the intervals prescribed by that regulation using the new anniversary date;
(c) the expiry date may remain unchanged provided one or more annual or intermediate surveys, as appropriate, are carried out so that the maximum intervals between the surveys prescribed by regulation 5 of this Annex are not exceeded.
(9) A certificate issued under regulation 6 or 7 of this Annex shall cease to be valid in any of the following cases:
(a) if the relevant surveys are not completed within the periods specified under regulation 5(1) of this Annex;
(b) if the certificate is not endorsed in accordance with regulation 5(1)(c) or 5(1)(d) of this Annex;
(c) upon transfer of the ship to the flag of another State. A new certificate shall only be issued when the Government issuing the new certificate is fully satisfied that the ship is in compliance with the requirements of regulation 5(4)(a) of this Annex. In the case of a transfer between Parties, if requested within three months after the transfer has taken place, the Government of the Party whose flag the ship was formerly entitled to fly shall, as soon as possible, transmit to the Administration copies of the certificate carried by the ship before the transfer and, if available, copies of the relevant survey reports."
