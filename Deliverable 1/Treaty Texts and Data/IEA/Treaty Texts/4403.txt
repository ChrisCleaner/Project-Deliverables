THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION COMMITTEE,
RECALLING article 38(a) of the Convention on the International Maritime Organization concerning the functions of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (the Committee) conferred upon it by international conventions for the prevention and control of marine pollution,
RECALLING ALSO resolution MEPC.20(22) by which the Committee adopted the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk (BCH Code),
NOTING article 16 of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the "1973 Convention") and article VI of the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the "1978 Protocol") which together specify the amendment procedure of the 1978 Protocol and confer upon the appropriate body of the Organization the function of considering and adopting amendments to the 1973 Convention, as modified by the 1978 Protocol (MARPOL 73/78),
CONSIDERING that it is highly desirable for the provisions of the BCH Code which are mandatory under MARPOL 73/78 and recommendatory from a safety standpoint, to remain identical, when adopted by the Marine Environment Protection Committee and the Maritime Safety Committee,
HAVING CONSIDERED the proposed amendments to the BCH Code,
1. ADOPTS, in accordance with article 16(2)(b), (c) and (d) of the 1973 Convention, the amendments to the BCH Code, the text of which is set out at the annex to the present resolution;
2. DETERMINES, in accordance with article 16(2)(f)(iii) of the 1973 Convention, that the amendments to the BCH Code shall be deemed to have been accepted on 1 February 2007 unless, prior to that date, not less than one-third of the Parties or Parties, the combined merchant fleets of which constitute not less than 50 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant fleet, have communicated to the Organization their objection to the amendments;
3. INVITES the Parties to note that, in accordance with article 16(2)(g)(ii) of the 1973 Convention, the amendments to the BCH Code shall enter into force on 1 August 2007 upon their acceptance in accordance with paragraph 2 above;
4. INVITES ALSO the Maritime Safety Committee to note this resolution and take action as appropriate;
5. REQUESTS the Secretary-General, in conformity with article 16(2)(e) of the 1973 Convention, to transmit to all Parties to MARPOL 73/78 certified copies of the present resolution and the text of the amendments to the BCH Code contained in the annex; and
6. REQUESTS FURTHER the Secretary-General to transmit copies of the present resolution and its annex to the Members of the Organization which are not Parties to MARPOL 73/78.

G - MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION
2.17 General
8 The existing text is replaced by the following:
"2.17.1 Structural materials used for tank construction, together with associated piping, pumps, valves, vents and their jointing materials, should be suitable at the temperature and pressure for the cargo to be carried in accordance with recognized standards. Steel is assumed to be the normal material of construction.
2.17.2 Where applicable, the following should be taken into account in selecting the material of construction:
.1 notch ductility at the operating temperature;
.2 corrosive effect of the cargo; and
.3 possibility of hazardous reactions between the cargo and the material of construction.
2.17.3 The shipper of the cargo is responsible for providing compatibility information to the ship operator and/or master. This must be done in a timely manner before transportation of the product. The cargo shall be compatible with all materials of construction such that:
.1 no damage to the integrity of the materials of construction is incurred; and
.2 no hazardous, or potentially hazardous reaction is created.
2.17.4 When a product is submitted to IMO for evaluation, and where compatibility of the product with materials referred to in paragraph 2.17 renders special requirements, the GESAMP/EHS Product Data Reporting Form shall provide information on the required materials of construction. These requirements shall be reflected in chapter IV and consequentially be referred to in column o of chapter 17 of the IBC Code. The reporting form shall also indicate if no special requirements are necessary. The producer of the product is responsible for providing the correct information."

Sampling points or detector heads should be located in suitable positions in order that potentially dangerous leakages are readily detected. When the flammable vapour concentration reaches a pre-set level which shall not be higher than 10% of the lower flammable limit, a continuous audible and visual alarm signal shall be automatically effected in the pump-room and cargo control room to alert personnel to the potential hazard. However, existing monitoring systems already fitted having a pre-set level not greater than 30% of the lower flammable limit may be accepted. Notwithstanding the above provisions, the Administration may exempt ships not engaged on international voyages from those requirements;
(b) regulations 13.3.4.2 to 13.3.4.5 and 13.4.3 should apply to ships of 500 tons gross tonnage and over;
