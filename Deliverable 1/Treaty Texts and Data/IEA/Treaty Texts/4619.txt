The secretariat noted the receipt of the proposed adjustment from Lithuania that would enable the country to accede to the 1994 Oslo Protocol on Further Reduction of Sulphur Emissions (1994 Sulphur Protocol). The secretariat had circulated it to Heads of delegation as required by article 11 to the Protocol.
The Executive Body agreed to adjust the 1994 Sulphur Protocol as requested by Lithuania, and invited the secretariat to notify the United Nations Depositary accordingly.
