 Noting also that other international instruments have been negotiated concerning the conservation and management of certain fish stocks,
 Having a mutual interest in the development and proper utilization of the living marine resources in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea and connecting waters (hereafter referred to as the Region) and desiring to further the attainment of their objectives through international cooperation which would be furthered by the establishment of a General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, 
 Recognizing the importance of fisheries conservation and management in the Region and of promoting cooperation to that effect, 
 Agree as follows:

The Contracting Parties hereby establish within the framework of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as "the Organization") a Commission to be known as the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (hereinafter referred to as "the Commission"), for the purpose of exercising the functions and discharging the responsibilities set forth in Article III below.

 4. A Regional Economic Integration Organization that is a Member of the Commission shall exercise its membership rights on an alternative basis with its member States that are Members of the Commission in the areas of their respective competence. Whenever a Regional Economic Integration Organization that is a Member of the Commission exercises its right to vote, its member States shall not exercise theirs, and conversely.

Any Member of the Commission may request a Regional Economic Integration Organization that is a Member of the Commission or its member States that are Members of the Commission to provide information as to which, as between the Member Organization and its member States, has competence in respect of any specific question.

Before any meeting of the Commission or a subsidiary body of the Commission, a Regional Economic Integration Organization that is a Member of the Commission, or its member States that are Members of the Commission shall indicate which, as between the Regional Economic Integration Organization and its Member States, has competence in respect to any specific question to be considered in the meeting and which, as between the Regional Economic Integration Organization and its member States, shall exercise the right to vote in respect of each particular agenda item. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Regional Economic Integration Organization that is a Member of the Commission or its member States that are Members of the Commission from making a single declaration for the purposes of this paragraph, which declaration shall remain in force for questions and agenda items to be considered at all subsequent meetings subject to such exceptions or modifications as may be indicated before any individual meeting. 
 7. In cases where an agenda item covers both matters in respect of which competence has been transferred to the Regional Economic Integration Organization and matters which lie within the competence of its member States, both the Regional Economic Integration Organization and its member States may participate in the discussions. In such cases the meeting, in arriving at its decisions, shall take into account only the intervention of the Member which has the right to vote.
 8. For the purpose of determining a quorum of any meeting of the Commission, the delegation of a Regional Economic Integration Organization that is a Member of the Commission shall be counted to the extent that it is entitled to vote in the meeting in respect of which the quorum is sought.
