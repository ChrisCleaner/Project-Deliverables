At the 60th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Santiago, Chile, from 23-27 June 2008, no modifications were made to the provision for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons.
The following amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling are therefore necessary (changes in bold italic type [bracketed: IEA editor]).
Paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
Substitute the dates [2008/2009] pelagic season, [2009] coastal season, [2009] season, or [2009] as appropriate.
