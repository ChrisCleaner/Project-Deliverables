5) Where a Contracting Party has doubts as to the thermal destructibility of the substances and materials proposed for incineration, pilot scale tests shall be undertaken before a permit may be issued.
6) Where a Contracting Party proposes to permit incineration of substances and
materials which have been subject to pilot scale tests and over which doubts as to the efficiency of combustion remain, the incineration system shall be subject to the same intensive stack monitoring as required for the initial marine incineration system survey. Consideration shall be given to the sampling and analysis of particulates, taking into account the solid content of the substances and materials.
Rule 5
Facilities for incineration at sea: operation requirements
1) The operation of the incineration system shall be controlled so as to ensure that:
a) the normal operating wall temperature exceeds 1200 Â°C unless the results of tests on the marine incineration facility demonstrate that the required combustion and destruction efficiencies can be achieved at a lower temperature. In the latter case, the Commission shall be informed of the results of these tests;
b) the theoretical minimum residence time within the incinerator, for a wall temperature of 1200 Â°C, is of the order of one second;
c) the combustion efficiency based on: Combustion efficiency
((Cco2-Cco)/Cco2) x100, where: [Editor's Change]
Cco2 = concentration of carbon dioxide in the combustion gases
Cco2 = concentration of carbon monoxide in the combustion gases
shall be at least 99.9 %;
d) the destruction efficiency based on a determination of the amount of the organohalogen substances added to the furnace which is not destroyed shall be at least equal to the combustion efficiency of the incinerator, i.e. 99.9 %. The routine measurement of this parameter shall be mandatory only after adequate measuring devices become available and following a decision by the Commission.
2) There shall be no black smoke nor flame extension above the plane of the stack.
Rule 6
Data to be recorded
1) Marine incineration facilities shall utilise recording devices and methods as approved under Rule 3. As a minimum, the following data shall be recorded during each incineration operation and retained for inspection by the Contracting Party which has issued the permit:
a) wall temperature measurements;
b) date and time during incineration and record of substances and materials being incinerated;
c) vessel position by appropriate navigational means;
d) feed rates and amounts of substances and materials;
e) O2, CO and CO2 concentration in combustion gases;
f) vessel's course and speed.
2) Where more than one Contracting Party has issued a permit for one incineration operation, arrangements for review of the data shall be made among the Contracting Parties involved.
Rule 7
Disposal of wastes and their residues
1) The Contracting Party which proposes to issue an incineration permit shall ensure that there are no means of disposing of wastes from the marine incineration facility except by means of the incinerator during normal operations.
2) Tank washings and other residues contaminated by the waste shall be incinerated at sea in accordance with these Rules and taking into account the provisions of the Code of Practice or discharged into port facilities in consultation with the competent national-authorities.
3) Any solid residues remaining in the incinerator shall not be removed from the incinerator until the marine incineration facility can safely offload them on land for disposal.
Rule 8
Prior Consultation Procedure
A Prior Consultation Procedure, to be determined by the Commission, shall be followed:
a) when a Contracting Party intends to issue a permit for the incineration of
substances and materials mentioned In paragraph 4 (c) of Rule 2, except when these substances and materials have already been the subject of a Prior Consultation Procedure;
b) when a Contracting Party considers that the incineration at sea of certain substances and materials with a destruction or a combustion efficiency of less than 99.9% is acceptable because there is no alternative means of disposal;
c) when a Contracting Party proposing to issue an incineration permit has doubts as to the technical conditions in which the operation could' take place and consequently considers it necessary to consult the other Contracting Parties to obtain additional information.
Rule 9
Incineration sites
