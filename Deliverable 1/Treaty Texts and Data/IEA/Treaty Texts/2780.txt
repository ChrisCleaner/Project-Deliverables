The Secretary of State presents his compliments to Their Excellencies and Messieurs the Chiefs of Mission of the Governments concerned with the Interim Convention on Conservation of North Pacific Fur Seals signed at Washington on February 9, 1957, as amended by the Protocol signed at Washington on October 8, 1963, and has the honor to refer to a letter dated October 13, 1968 received from the Chairman of the North Pacific Fur Seal Commission, a copy of which is enclosed. It is the understanding of the Government of the United States that similar letters have been received by each of the Parties to the above-mentioned Convention.
In view of the recommendation by the North Pacific Fur Seal Commission that studies be continued to determine whether or not palagic sealing in conjunction with land sealing could be permitted in certain circumstances without adversely affecting achievement of the objectives of the Convention; the Government of the United States agrees with the Chairman of the Commission that it would be in order for the Parties to continue the amended Convention in force for an additional period of time.
It is the understanding of the Government of the United States that the Parties agree, with reference to Article XIII, paragraph 4, of the amended Convention that the Convention as amended shall continue in force for eighteen years and thereafter until the entry into force of a new or revised fur seal convention between the Parties, or until the expiration of one year after such period of eighteen years, whichever may be earlier, and, with reference to Article XI, that the Parties shall meet for the purposes set forth in that Article at a mutually acceptable time, not later than early in the eighteenth year, after further recommendations have been made by the Commission.
It is further the understanding of the Government of the United States that a meeting of the Parties early in the twelfth year of the Convention will be unnecessary, the purposes of such meeting already having been accomplished as herein indicated.
The Government of the United States hereby confirms the foregoing understanding on its part and would appreciate receiving written confirmations of such understandings by the other Parties. The Government of the United States will be pleased to notify such Parties of confirmations when received.
