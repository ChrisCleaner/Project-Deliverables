1.0 SITE CLASSIFICATION
Solid waste disposal sites shall be classified in accordance with the geological and geohydrological properties of each site:
1.1 Class 1 - Containment sites: Sites with very low permeability soil (maximum permeability 10-6cm sec -1), thus allowing very little or no chance of leachate reaching groundwater.
1.2 Class 2 - Domestic/sanitary waste sites: Sites on which waste is separated from the groundwater table by sufficient semi permeable soil (maximum permeability 10-3cm sec -1).
1.3 Class 3 - Unacceptable sites: Sites where there is no attenuation zone at all due to the solid waste being in direct contact with the groundwater table.
2.0 WASTE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
2.1 As a general rule, the following chemical criteria shall apply for acceptance or either Class 1 or Class 2 disposal sites:
2.1.1 The pH of the waste or the pH of a 1:1 w/w extract with water shall lie between 7 and 12.
2.1.2 Free cyanide shall not be present in a concentration greater than 0.4ppm.
2.1.3 The waste shall not contain more than 10 ppm of free sulphide.
2.1.4 The flashpoint of the waste as measured by the closed cup method, shall not be below 60°C.
2.1.5 The waste shall not react with air or water within the pH range 7 to 12, to produce flammable, explosive or toxic gases.
2.1.6 The waste shall not contain highly reactive redox compounds.
