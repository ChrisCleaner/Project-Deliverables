5. Each contracting Government shall declare for all whale catchers under its jurisdiction not operating in conjunction with a factory ship or land station one continuous open seasons not to exceed six months out of any period of twelve months during which the taking or killing of minke whales by such whale catchers may be permitted. Notwithstanding this paragraph one continuous open season not to exceed nine months may be implemented so far as Greenland is concerned. [This paragraph shall not apply to aboriginal subsistence whaling under paragraphs 13(b)(3)(ii) and 13(b)(3)(iii).]
Baleen Whale Catch Limits 13(a) . . .
(6)	[Commencing in 2026, and provided the appropriate Strike Limit Algorithm has been developed by then, strike/catch limits (including any carry forward provisions) for each stock identified in sub- paragraph 13(b) shall be extended every six years, provided: (a) the Scientific Committee advises in 2024, and every six years thereafter, that such limits will not harm that stock; (b) the Commission does not receive a request from an ASW country relying on the stock (‘relevant ASW country’), for a change in the relevant catch limits based on need; and (c) the Commission determines that the relevant ASW country has complied with the approved timeline and that the information provided represents a status quo continuation of the hunt.]
(7)	[The provisions for each stock identified in sub-paragraph 13(b), especially the provisions for carryover, shall be reviewed by the Commission in light of the advice of the Scientific Committee.]
13(b) Catch limits for aboriginal subsistence whaling are as follows:
(1)	The taking of bowhead whales from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock by aborigines is permitted, but only when the meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines and further provided that:
(i) For the years //2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018// [2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025], the number of bowhead whales landed shall not exceed //336// [392]. For each of these years the number of bowhead whales struck shall not exceed 67, except that any unused portion of a strike quota from //any year (including 15 unused strikes from the 2008- 2012 quota)// [the three prior quota blocks] shall be carried forward and added to the strike quotas of //any// subsequent years, provided that no more than //15 strikes// [50 percent of the annual strike limit] shall be added to the strike quota for any one year.
(ii)	//This provision shall be reviewed annually by the Commission in light of the advice of the Scientific Committee.//
(2)	The taking of gray whales from the Eastern stock in the North Pacific is permitted, but only by aborigines or a contracting Government on behalf of aborigines, and then only when the meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines.
(i) For the years //2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018// [2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024
and 2025], the number of gray whales [landed] //taken in accordance with this sub-paragraph// shall not exceed //744// [980], provided that the number of gray whales [struck] //taken// in any one of the years //2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018// [2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025] shall not exceed 140[, except that any unused portion of a strike quota from the prior quota block shall be carried forward and added to the strike quotas of subsequent years, provided that no more than 50 percent of the annual strike limit shall be added to the strike quota for any one year].
(ii)	//This provision shall be reviewed annually by the Commission in light of the advice of the Scientific Committee.//
(3)	The taking by aborigines of minke whales from the West Greenland and Central stocks [from the East Greenland hunt] and fin whales from the West Greenland stock and bowhead whales from the West Greenland feeding aggregation and humpback whales from the West Greenland feeding aggregation is permitted and then only when the meat and products are to be used exclusively for local consumption.
(i)	The number of fin whales struck from the West Greenland stock //in accordance with this subparagraph// shall not exceed 19 in each of the years //2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018// [2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, except that any unused portion of a strike quota from the prior quota block under a Strike Limit Algorithm management advice shall be carried forward and added to the strike quotas of subsequent years, provided that no more than 50 percent of the annual strike limit shall be added to the strike quota for any one year.]
(ii)	The number of minke whales struck from the Central stock //in accordance with this sub- paragraph// shall not exceed //12// [20] in each of the years //2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018// [2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025], except that any unused portion of //the// [a] strike quota //for each year// shall be carried forward //from that year// and added to the [strike] quota[s] of //any// subsequent years, provided that no more than 3 [strikes] shall be added to the [strike] quota for any one year. [Commencing in 2020, and provided a Strike Limit Algorithm for this stock has been developed by then, any unused portion of a strike quota from the prior quota block under a Strike Limit Algorithm management advice shall be carried forward and added to the strike quotas of subsequent years, provided that no more than 50 percent of the annual strike limit shall be added to the strike quota for any one year.]
(iii)	The number of minke whales struck from the West Greenland stock shall not exceed 164 in each of the years //2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018// [2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025], except that any unused portion of //the// [a strike] quota //for each year// [from the prior quota block under a Strike Limit Algorithm management advice] shall be carried forward //from that year// and added to the strike quota[s] of //any of the// subsequent years, provided that no more than //15 strikes // [50 percent of the annual strike limit] shall be added to the strike quota for any one year. //This provision will be reviewed if new scientific data become available within the 4 year period and if necessary amended on basis of the advice of the Scientific Committee.//
