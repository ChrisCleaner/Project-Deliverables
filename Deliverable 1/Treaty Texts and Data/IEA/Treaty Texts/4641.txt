The Conference of the Parties,
Welcoming the intention expressed by Turkey to accede to the Convention,
Recalling Article 4, paragraph 2(f), of the Convention,
Recalling further its decision 15/CP.4,
Recalling also the conclusions of the Conference of the Parties as agreed at its fifth session and the first part of its sixth session, in the light of the new request by Turkey,
Recalling also the amendments proposed by Azerbaijan and Pakistan concerning the deletion of the name of Turkey from the lists in Annexes I and II to the Convention,
Taking note of the information contained in documents FCCC/CP/1997/MISC.3 and FCCC/CP/2001/11,
Underlining that Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities,
Having considered the request put forward by Turkey, in particular the new proposal presented at the first part of the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties, that its name should be deleted from Annex II to the Convention,
1. Decides to amend the list in Annex II to the Convention by deleting the name of Turkey;
2. Notes that the entry into force of this amendment to the list in Annex II to the Convention shall be subject to the same procedure as that for the entry into force of annexes to the Convention in accordance with Article 16, paragraph 3, of the Convention;
3. Invites the Parties to recognize the special circumstances of Turkey, which place Turkey, after becoming a Party, in a situation different from that of other Parties included in Annex I to the Convention.
