ANNEX
AMENDMENTS TO THE IBC CODE
CHAPTER 8
CARGO-TANK VENTING AND GAS-FREEING ARRANGEMENTS
1 In paragraph 8.1.1, the word "This" is replaced by the words "Unless expressly provided otherwise, this".
2 The following new paragraph 8.1.6 is added after the existing paragraph 8.1.5:
"8.1.6 Ships constructed on or after 1 July 1986 but before 1 July 2002 should comply with the requirements of paragraph 8.3.3 by the date of the first scheduled dry-docking after 1 July 2002, but not later than 1 July 2005. However, the Administration may approve relaxation of paragraph 8.3.3 for ships of less than 500 gross tonnage which were constructed on or after 1 July 1986 but before 1 July 2002."
3 In the last sentence of the existing paragraph 8.3.2, the reference to "8.3.5" is replaced by reference to "8.3.6".
4 The following new paragraph 8.3.3 is added after the existing paragraph 8.3.2:
"8.3.3 On ships constructed on or after 1 July 2002, controlled tank venting systems should consist of a primary and a secondary means of allowing full flow relief of vapour to prevent over-pressure or under-pressure in the event of failure of one means. Alternatively, the secondary means may consist of pressure sensors fitted in each tank with a monitoring system in the ship's cargo control room or position from which cargo operations are normally carried out. Such monitoring equipment should also provide an alarm facility which is activated by detection of over-pressure or under-pressure conditions within a tank."
5 The existing paragraphs 8.3.3 to 8.3.7 are renumbered as paragraphs 8.3.4 to 8.3.8.
6 In the last sentence of renumbered paragraph 8.3.5, the reference to "8.3.3.1" is replaced by reference to "8.3.4.1".
