Preamble
The Parties to this Supplementary Protocol,
Being Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, hereinafter referred to as "the Protocol",
Taking into account Principle 13 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development,
Reaffirming the precautionary approach contained in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development,
Recognizing the need to provide for appropriate response measures where there is damage or sufficient likelihood of damage, consistent with the Protocol,
Recalling Article 27 of the Protocol,
Have agreed as follows:
Article 1. Objective
The objective of this Supplementary Protocol is to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health, by providing international rules and procedures in the field of liability and redress relating to living modified organisms.
Article 2. Use of terms
1. The terms used in Article 2 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, hereinafter referred to as "the Convention", and Article 3 of the Protocol shall apply to this Supplementary Protocol.
2. In addition, for the purposes of this Supplementary Protocol:
a) "Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol" means the Conference of the Parties to the Convention serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol;
b) "Damage" means an adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health, that:
i. Is measurable or otherwise observable taking into account, wherever available, scientifically-established baselines recognized by a competent authority that takes into account any other human induced variation and natural variation; and
ii. Is significant as set out in paragraph 3 below;
c) "Operator" means any person in direct or indirect control of the living modified organism which could, as appropriate and as determined by domestic law, include, inter alia, the permit holder, person who placed the living modified organism on the market, developer, producer, notifier, exporter, importer, carrier or supplier;
d) "Response measures" means reasonable actions to:
i. Prevent, minimize, contain, mitigate, or otherwise avoid damage, as appropriate;
ii. Restore biological diversity through actions to be undertaken in the following order of preference:
a) Restoration of biological diversity to the condition that existed before the damage occurred, or its nearest equivalent; and where the competent authority determines this is not possible;
b) Restoration by, inter alia, replacing the loss of biological diversity with other components of biological diversity for the same, or for another type of use either at the same or, as appropriate, at an alternative location.
3. A "significant" adverse effect is to be determined on the basis of factors, such as:
a) The long-term or permanent change, to be understood as change that will not be redressed through natural recovery within a reasonable period of time;
b) The extent of the qualitative or quantitative changes that adversely affect the components of biological diversity;
c) The reduction of the ability of components of biological diversity to provide goods and services;
d) The extent of any adverse effects on human health in the context of the Protocol.
Article 3. Scope
1. This Supplementary Protocol applies to damage resulting from living modified organisms which find their origin in a transboundary movement. The living modified organisms referred to are those:
a) Intended for direct use as food or feed, or for processing;
b) Destined for contained use;
c) Intended for intentional introduction into the environment.
2. With respect to intentional transboundary movements, this Supplementary Protocol applies to damage resulting from any authorized use of the living modified organisms referred to in paragraph 1 above.
3. This Supplementary Protocol also applies to damage resulting from unintentional transboundary movements as referred to in Article 17 of the Protocol as well as damage resulting from illegal transboundary movements as referred to in Article 25 of the Protocol.
4. This Supplementary Protocol applies to damage resulting from a transboundary movement of living modified organisms that started after the entry into force of this Supplementary Protocol for the Party into whose jurisdiction the transboundary movement was made.
5. This Supplementary Protocol applies to damage that occurred in areas within the limits of the national jurisdiction of Parties.
6. Parties may use criteria set out in their domestic law to address damage that occurs within the limits of their national jurisdiction.
7. Domestic law implementing this Supplementary Protocol shall also apply to damage resulting from transboundary movements of living modified organisms from non-Parties.
Article 4. Causation
A causal link shall be established between the damage and the living modified organism in question in accordance with domestic law.
Article 5. Response measures
1. Parties shall require the appropriate operator or operators, in the event of damage, subject to any requirements of the competent authority, to:
a) Immediately inform the competent authority;
b) Evaluate the damage; and
c) Take appropriate response measures.
2. The competent authority shall:
a) Identify the operator which has caused the damage;
b) Evaluate the damage; and
c) Determine which response measures should be taken by the operator.
3. Where relevant information, including available scientific information or information available in the Biosafety Clearing-House, indicates that there is a sufficient likelihood that damage will result if timely response measures are not taken, the operator shall be required to take appropriate response measures so as to avoid such damage.
4. The competent authority may implement appropriate response measures, including, in particular, when the operator has failed to do so.
5. The competent authority has the right to recover from the operator the costs and expenses of, and incidental to, the evaluation of the damage and the implementation of any such appropriate response measures. Parties may provide, in their domestic law, for other situations in which the operator may not be required to bear the costs and expenses.
6. Decisions of the competent authority requiring the operator to take response measures should be reasoned. Such decisions should be notified to the operator. Domestic law shall provide for remedies, including the opportunity for administrative or judicial review of such decisions. The competent authority shall, in accordance with domestic law, also inform the operator of the available remedies. Recourse to such remedies shall not impede the competent authority from taking response measures in appropriate circumstances, unless otherwise provided by domestic law.
7. In implementing this Article and with a view to defining the specific response measures to be required or taken by the competent authority, Parties may, as appropriate, assess whether response measures are already addressed by their domestic law on civil liability.
8. Response measures shall be implemented in accordance with domestic law.
Article 6. Exemptions
1. Parties may provide, in their domestic law, for the following exemptions:
a) Act of God or force majeure; and
b) Act of war or civil unrest.
2. Parties may provide, in their domestic law, for any other exemptions or mitigations as they may deem fit.

a) Relative and/or absolute time limits including for actions related to response measures; and
b) The commencement of the period to which a time limit applies.
Article 8. Financial limits
Parties may provide, in their domestic law, for financial limits for the recovery of costs and expenses related to response measures.
Article 9. Right of recourse
This Supplementary Protocol shall not limit or restrict any right of recourse or indemnity that an operator may have against any other person.
