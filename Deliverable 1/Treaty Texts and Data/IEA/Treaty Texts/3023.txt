 beginning at the terminus of the international boundary between the United States of America and Canada in Grand Manan Channel, at a point at 44*46' 35.346" north latitude; 66*54' 11.253" west longitude; thence due south to the parallel of 43*50' north latitude; thence due west to the meridian of 67*24'27.24" west longitude; thence along a geodetic line in a southwesterly direction to a point at 42*53'14" north latitude and 67*44'35" west longitude; thence along a geodetic line in a southeasterly direction to a point at 42*31'08" north latitude and 67*28'05" west longitude; thence along a geodetic line to a point at 42*20' north latitude and 67*18'13.15" west longitude;
 thence due east to a point in 66*00' west longitude; thence along a rhumb line in a southeasterly direction to a point at 42*00' north latitude and 65*40' west longitude and thence due south to the parallel of 39*00' north latitude. 
 5(b) Subarea 4 is composed of six Divisions:
 Division 4R
 That portion of the Subarea lying between the coast of Newfoundland from Cape Bauld to Cape Ray and a line described as follows: beginning at Cape Bauld, thence due north to the parallel of 52*15' north latitude, thence due west to the Labrador coast, thence along the Labrador coast to the terminus of the Labrador-Quebec boundary, thence along a rhumb line in a southwesterly direction to a point at 49*25' north latitude, 60*00' west longitude, thence due south to a point at 47*50' north latitude, 60*00' west longitude, thence along a rhumb line in a southeasterly direction to the point at which the boundary of Subarea 3 intersects the straight line joining Cape North, Nova Scotia with Cape Ray, Newfoundland, thence to Cape Ray, Newfoundland;
 Division 4S
 That portion of the Subarea lying between the south coast of Quebec from the terminus of the Labrador Quebec boundary to Pte. des Monts and a line described as follows: beginning at Pte. des Monts, thence due east to a point at 49*25' north latitude, 64*40' west longitude, thence along a rhumb line in an east-southeasterly direction to a point at 47*50' north latitude, 60*00' west longitude, thence due north to a point at 49*25' north latitude, 60*00' west longitude, thence along a rhumb line in a northeasterly direction to the terminus of the Labrador-Quebec boundary;
 Division 4T
 That portion of the Subarea lying between the coasts of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec from Cape North to Pte. des Monts and a line described as follows: beginning at Pte. des Monts, thence due east to a point at 49*25' north latitude, 64*40' west longitude, thence along a rhumb line in a southeasterly direction to a point at 47*50' north latitude, 60*00' west longitude, thence along a rhumb line in a southerly direction to Cape North, Nova Scotia;
 Division 4V
 That portion of the Subarea lying between the coast of Nova Scotia between Cape North and Fourchu and a line described as follows: beginning at Fourchu, thence along a rhumb line in an easterly direction to a point at 45*40' north latitude, 60*00' west longitude, thence due south along the meridian of 60*00' west longitude to the parallel of 44*10' north latitude, thence due east to the meridian of 59*00' west longitude, thence due south to the parallel of 39*00' north latitude, thence due east to a point where the boundary between Subareas 3 and 4 meets the parallel of 39*00' north latitude, thence along the boundary between Subareas 3 and 4 and a line continuing in a northwesterly direction to a point at 47*50' north latitude, 60*00' west longitude, and thence along a rhumb line in a southerly direction to Cape North, Nova Scotia;
 Division 4V is divided into two Subdivisions:
 4Vn - Northern Subdivision - That portion of Division 4V lying north of the parallel of 45*40' north latitude; 
 4Vs - Southern Subdivision - That portion of Division 4V lying south of the parallel of 45*40' north latitude.
 Division 4W
 That portion of the Subarea lying between the coast of Nova Scotia from Halifax to Fourchu and a line described as follows: beginning at Fourchu, thence along a rhumb line in an easterly direction to a point at 45*40' north latitude, 60*00' west longitude, thence due south along the meridian of 60*00' west longitude to the parallel of 44*10' north latitude, thence due east to the meridian of 59*00' west longitude, thence due south to the parallel of 39*00' north latitude, thence due west to the meridian of 63*20' west longitude, thence due north to a point on that meridian at 44*20' north latitude, thence along a rhumb line in a northwesterly direction to Halifax, Nova Scotia;
 Division 4X
 That portion of the Subarea lying between the western boundary of Subarea 4 and the coasts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia from the terminus of the boundary between New Brunswick and Maine to Halifax, and a line described as follows: beginning at Halifax, thence along a rhumb line in a southeasterly direction to a point at 44*20' north latitude, 63*20' west longitude, thence due south to the parallel of 39*00' north latitude, and thence due west to the meridian of 65*40' west longitude. 
 6(a) Subarea 5
 That portion of the Convention Area lying to the west of the western boundary of Subarea 4, to the north of the parallel of 39*00' north latitude, and to the east of the meridian of 71*40' west longitude.
 6(b) Subarea 5 is composed of two Divisions:
 Division 5Y
