ANNEX
AMENDMENTS TO MARPOL ANNEX VI AND THE NOX TECHNICAL CODE 2008
Amendments to MARPOL Annex VI
1 New paragraph 1bis is added to regulation 17:
1bis Small Island Developing States may satisfy the requirements in paragraph 1 of this regulation through regional arrangements when, because of those States' unique circumstances, such arrangements are the only practical means to satisfy these requirements. Parties participating in a regional arrangement shall develop a Regional Reception Facilities Plan, taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization.
The Government of each Party participating in the arrangement shall consult with the Organization for circulation to the Parties of the present Convention:
.1 how the Regional Reception Facilities Plan takes into account the Guidelines;
.2 particulars of the identified Regional Ships Waste Reception Centres; and
.3 particulars of those ports with only limited facilities.
Amendments to the NOX Technical Code 2008
2 Existing paragraph 2.2.4 is replaced by the following:
"2.2.4 Engines not pre-certified on a test-bed
.1 There are engines which, due to their size, construction and delivery schedule, cannot be pre-certified on a test-bed. In such cases, the engine manufacturer, shipowner or shipbuilder shall make application to the Administration requesting an onboard test (see 2.1.2.2). The applicant must demonstrate to the Administration that the onboard test fully meets all of the requirements of a test-bed procedure as specified in chapter 5 of this Code. In no case shall an allowance be granted for possible deviations of measurements if an initial survey is carried out on board a ship without any valid pre-certification test. For engines undergoing an onboard certification test, in order to be issued with an EIAPP Certificate, the same procedures apply as if the engine had been pre-certified on a test-bed, subject to the limitations given in paragraph 2.2.4.2.
.2 This pre-certification survey procedure may be accepted for an Individual Engine or for an Engine Group represented by the Parent Engine only, but it shall not be accepted for an Engine Family certification."
3 Paragraph 2.2.5.1 is replaced by the following:
".1 Where a NOx-reducing device is to be included within the EIAPP certification, it must be recognized as a component of the engine, and its presence shall be recorded in the engine's Technical File. The engine shall be tested with the NOx-reducing device fitted unless, due to technical and practical reasons, the combined testing is not appropriate and the procedures specified in paragraph 2.2.4.1 cannot be applied, subject to approval by the Administration. In the latter case, the applicable test procedure shall be performed and the combined engine/NOx-reducing device shall be approved and pre-certified by the Administration taking into account guidelines developed by the Organization*. However, this pre-certification is subject to the limitations given in paragraph 2.2.4.2."
* Refer to the 2011 Guidelines addressing additional aspects to the NOx Technical Code 2008 with regard to particular requirements related to marine diesel engines fitted with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems adopted by resolution MEPC.198(62).
