[The amendments whereby one new entry was added to both Annex VIII and Annex IX entered into force on 8 October 2005 (depositary notification C.N.1044.2005), six months following the issuance of depositary notification C.N.263.2005 of 8 April 2005 (re-issued on 13 June 2005, reflecting Decision VII/19 adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its seventh meeting).]
VII/19. Review or adjustment of the lists of wastes contained in Annexes VIII and IX to the Basel Convention
The Conference of the Parties,
Considering the application submitted by India concerning the placement of new entries regarding plastic-coated cable scrap on Annex VIII and Annex IX,
Aware of the health concerns that are also dealt with under the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants regarding the burning of some types of plastic coated cables and the potential for the formation of unintentionally produced persistent organic pollutants (POPs),
Noting that work on Annex III hazard characteristics, in particular H10, H11 and H13, is progressing and represents a step in considering the classification of, for example, PVC wastes,
1. Adopts the following amendments to Annexes VIII and IX of the Basel Convention:
(a) New entry A 1190 in Annex VIII:
Waste metal cables coated or insulated with plastics containing or contaminated with coal tar, PCB [PCBs are at a concentration level of 50 mg/kg or more], lead, cadmium, other organohalogen compounds or other Annex I constituents to an extent that they exhibit Annex III characteristics; 
(b) New entry B 1115 in Annex IX:
Waste metal cables coated or insulated with plastics, not included in list A A1190, excluding those destined for Annex IVA operations or any other disposal operations involving, at any stage, uncontrolled thermal processes, such as open-burning.
