THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION COMMITTEE,
NOTING Resolution 26 of the International Conference on Marine Pollution, 1973 which requested the appropriate body designated by the Organization to establish, not later than 30 November 1974, the list of substances to be annexed to the Protocol Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Marine Pollution by Substances Other than Oil, 1973 (the 1973 Protocol),
NOTING FURTHER Resolution A.296(VII) by which the Assembly designated the Committee as the appropriate body referred to in articles I and III of the above-mentioned Protocol,
RECALLING Resolution MEPC.1(II) by which the Committee established on 21 November 1974 a list of substances to be annexed to the Protocol Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Marine Pollution by Substances Other than Oil, in accordance with Resolution 26 of the International Conference on Marine Pollution, 1973 and Resolution A.296(VII),
HAVING CONSIDERED proposals by governments for revising the list,
HAVING taken account of scientific advice provided by the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution (GESAMP) with regard to evaluation of the hazards of harmful substances in the marine environment and by the International Atomic Energy Agency in respect of radioactive materials,
HAVING taken account of technical advice provided by the Sub-Committees on Bulk Chemicals and on the Carriage of Dangerous Goods,
1. ADOPTS by the required two-thirds-majority of the Parties to the 1973 Protocol present and voting in the Committee the amended list which appears in the Annex to this Resolution;
2. REQUESTS the Secretary-General to communicate the amended list to all Parties to the 1973 Protocol in accordance with article III, paragraph 5, for acceptance, and inform them that the amended list shall be deemed to have been accepted at the end of the period of six months after it has been communicated, unless within that period an objection to these amendments has been communicated to the Organization by not less than one third of the Parties, and that the amended list shall enter into force three months after it has been deemed to have been accepted;
3. REQUESTS FURTHER the Secretary-General to annex copies thereof to the authentic text of the Protocol in accordance with article I, paragraph 2(a), once the amended list has been accepted in accordance with article III, paragraph 6, to replace the existing list;
4. DECIDES that the list should be kept under review, in consultation and co-operation with competent international organizations, in particular the International Atomic Energy Agency in respect of radioactive materials.
