    ï»¿European Agreement on the Restriction of the Use of certain Detergents in Washing and Cleaning Products
SRC: http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/064.htm
The Governments of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the French Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Swiss Confederation and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
Considering that the Parties to the Brussels Treaty of 17th March 1948, as amended on 23rd October 1954, resolved to strengthen the social ties by which they are united and to make every effort in common, both by direct consultation and in specialized Agencies, to raise the standard of living of their peoples and promote the harmonious development of social services in their respective countries;
Considering that the social activities governed by the Brussels Treaty and carried on, until 1959, under the auspices of the Brussels Treaty Organisation and the Western European Union are now conducted within the framework of the Council of Europe, in accordance with the decision taken on 21st October 1959 by the Council of Western European Union and with Resolution (59) 23 adopted on 16th November 1959 by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe;
Considering that the Swiss Confederation and the Kingdom of Denmark have participated since 6th May 1964 and 2nd April 1968 respectively in activities in the field of public health carried on under the aforesaid resolution;
Whereas the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve greater unity between its members, so as to further economic and social progress by agreements and by common action in economic, social, cultural, scientific, legal and administrative matters;
Whereas the said governments have striven to encourage progress as far as may be practicable not only in social matters but in the related field of public health, and have undertaken to harmonies their national legislations in pursuance of the action mentioned in the foregoing paragraph;
Whereas it is becoming increasingly necessary to secure harmonization of the laws on the control of fresh water pollution;
Being convinced that appropriate measures are essential not only from the standpoint of human needs but also to ensure the protection of nature in general, the paramount objectives being to protect effectively:
a. the supply of water for the population, for industry, for agriculture and for other business occupations;
b. the natural aquatic fauna and flora, and in particular so far as they contribute to human well-being;
c. the unhindered enjoyment of places devoted to leisure and sport;
Observing that the general household and industrial use of certain types of detergents might cause considerable prejudice to these interests;
Feeling, therefore, that some restriction must be put on the use of such products,
Have agreed as follows:
Article 1
This Agreement applies to any washing and cleaning product (detergent) the composition of which has been specially devised with a view to developing its detergent properties and which may be made up of surfactants, adjuvants, intensifying agents, fillers, additives and other auxiliary constituents.
Article 2
The use of products of the kind referred to in Article 1 shall not, under conditions of normal use, adversely affect man and the environment.
Article 3
1. "The Contracting Parties undertake to adopt measures as effective as possible in the light of the available techniques, including legislation if it is necessary, to ensure that in their respective territories:
a. no products of the kind referred to in Article 1 are put on the market unless the anionic and non-ionic surfactants which they contain are at least 80% susceptible to biological degradation as determined by the best practical techniques, such as the OECD reference method or any other method providing equivalent results;
b. the same objectives be achieved when considered appropriate with regard to cationic and ampholytic surfactants;
c. appropriate measurement and control procedures are implemented to guarantee compliance with the provisions of sub-paragraphs a and b of this paragraph.
2. The Contracting Parties may exempt the following surfactants, in the absence of suitable substitutes, from the requirements of paragraph 1:
a. low-foaming alkene oxide additives on such substances as alcohols, alkylphenols, glycols, polyols, fatty acids, amides or amines, used in dish-washing products;
b. surfactants mentioned under sub-paragraph a of this paragraph, and alkali-resistant terminally blocked alkyl and alkyl-aryl polyglycol ethers, used in cleaning agents for the food, beverage and metal working industries."
Article 3bis
The Contracting Parties undertake to intensify their research leading to a better understanding and assessment of the biological degradability of surfactants and to encourage, where necessary, the research for phosphate substitutes.

2. Such accession shall be effected by depositing with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe an instrument of accession which shall take effect one month after the date of its deposit.
