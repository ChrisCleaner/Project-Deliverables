Source: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1956/11.html
THE CONTRACTING GOVERNMENTS, desiring to prevent, through concerted action, the introduction into and spread within the South East Asia and Pacific Region of destructive plant diseases and pests, have concluded the following Agreement, which is a supplementary agreement under Article III of the International Plant Protection Convention of 1951:

East and 165deg. West and latitudes 15deg. North and 20deg. South, but excluding Australia;
(b) "plant" or "plants" means all species of plants or parts thereof, whether living or dead (including stems, branches, tubers, bulbs, corms, stocks, budwood, cuttings, layers, slips, suckers, roots, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds and any other parts of plants);
(c) "territory" means a State or Territory within the Region defined in (a) above;
(d) "the Organization" means the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations;
(e) "the Committee" means the Plant Protection Committee for the South East Asia and Pacific Region established in pursuance of Article II of this Agreement.
Article II
Regional committee
1. The Contracting Governments hereby establish a regional committee, to be known as the Plant Protection Committee for the South East Asia and Pacific Region, whose functions shall include:
(a) the determination of procedures and arrangements necessary for the implementation of this Agreement and the making of recommendations to the Contracting Governments accordingly;
(b) the review of reports submitted by the Contracting Governments of progress in the implementation of this Agreement;
(c) the consideration of problems requiring cooperation on a regional basis and of measures for mutual assistance.
2. Each Contracting Government shall be represented on the Committee and shall have one vote. A majority of the Contracting Governments shall constitute a quorum. Decisions of the Committee shall be taken by a majority of the votes cast except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
3. The Committee shall meet whenever convened by the Director-General of the Organization after consultation with the Chairman of the Committee. The Director-General of the Organization shall convene the Committee at least once every two years or when so requested by at least one third of the Contracting Governments.

Article III
Measures regarding the importation of plants from outside the Region
For the purpose of preventing the introduction into its territory or territories of destructive diseases and pests, and in particular those listed in Appendix A to this Agreement, each Contracting Government shall use its best endeavours to apply, with respect to the importation of any plants, including their packings and containers, and any packings and containers of plant origin, from anywhere outside the Region, such measures of prohibition, certification, inspection, disinfection, disinfestation, quarantine, destruction or other measures as may be recommended by the Committee, taking into consideration the provisions of Articles V and VI of the International Plant Protection Convention.
Appendix A to this Agreement may be modified by a decision of the Committee.
Article IV
Measures to exclude South American leaf blight of Hevea from the Region
In view of the importance of the Hevea rubber industry in the Region, and of the danger of introducing the destructive South American leaf blight (Dothidella ulei) of the Hevea rubber tree, the Contracting Governments shall take the measures specified in Appendix B to this Agreement. Appendix B to this Agreement may be modified by a decision of the Committee taken unanimously.
Article V

APPENDIX B
MEASURES TO EXCLUDE SOUTH AMERICAN LEAF BLIGHT OF HEVEA FROM THE REGION
1. In this Appendix-
(a) "the American tropics" means those parts of the continent of America, including adjacent islands, which are bounded by the Tropic of Capricorn (latitude 231/2deg. S) and the Tropic of Cancer (latitude 231/2deg. N) and the meridians of longitude 30deg. W and 120deg. W, and includes the part of Mexico north of the Tropic of Cancer;
(b) "Competent Authority" means the officer or Government Department or other agency, which each Contracting Government recognizes as its authority for the purpose of this Appendix.
2. Each Contracting Government shall prohibit by law the importation into its territory or territories of any plant or plants of the genus Hevea from outside the Region, unless-
(a) the importation is made for scientific purposes; and
(b) written permission has been granted for each consignment of plant or plants by the Competent Authority of the importing territory or territories and the importation is in accordance with such special conditions as may be imposed by the Competent Authority in granting such permission; and
(c) the plant or plants have been disinfected and freed of any original soil in the country of origin in a manner acceptable to the Competent Authority of the importing territory and are free from pests and diseases, and each consignment of plant or plants is accompanied or covered by a certificate to the effect that the above requirements have been fulfilled, and signed by an appropriate authority in the country of origin; and
(d) each consignment is addressed to and is received by the Competent Authority of the importing territory.
3. Each Contracting Government shall prohibit by law the importation into its territory or territories of any plant or plants of the genus Hevea capable of further growth or propagation (excluding seed) from the American tropics or from any other country in which South American leaf blight (Dothidella ulei) is present, unless, in addition to the requirements of paragraph 2 of this Appendix, at a place approved by the Competent Authority of the importing territory and situated outside the Region and outside the American tropics and any other country in which South American leaf blight (Dothidella ulei) is present, such plant or plants have been grown for an adequate period at a plant quarantine station for Hevea and each consignment of such plant or plants is accompanied or covered by a certificate to the effect that the above requirements have been fulfilled, and signed by the officer-in-charge of such quarantine station.
4. Each Contracting Government shall prohibit by law the importation into its territory or territories of any seed of any plant of the genus Hevea from the American tropics or from any other country in which South American leaf blight (Dothidella ulei) is present, unless, in addition to the requirements of paragraph 2 of this Appendix, such seed, having been examined and again disinfected at a place approved by the Competent Authority of the importing territory and situated outside the Region and outside the American tropics and any other country in which South American leaf blight (Dothidella ulei) is present, has been repacked with new packing materials in new containers, and unless each consignment of such seed is accompanied or covered by a certificate to the effect that the above requirements have been fulfilled, and signed by the officer-in-charge of these operations.
5. Each Contracting Government shall prohibit by law the importation into its territory or territories of any plant or plants of the genus Hevea not capable of further growth or propagation (such as fresh or dried herbarium specimens); unless in addition to the requirements of sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of paragraph 2 of this Appendix, the Competent Authority of the importing country is satisfied that such plant or plants are required for a legitimate special purpose and that such plant or plants have been sterilized in the country of origin by a method satisfactory to the said Competent Authority.
6. Each Contracting Government shall prohibit by law the importation into its territory or territories of any plant or plants, other than the genus Hevea, capable of further growth or propagation and originating in the American tropics or in any other country in which South American leaf blight (Dothidella ulei) is present, unless written permission has been granted for each consignment of such plant or plants by the Competent Authority of the importing territory or territories and the importation is in accordance with such special conditions as may be imposed by the Competent Authority in granting such permission.
7. The Competent Authority of any territory or territories into which any plant or plants of the genus Hevea are imported for further growth or propagation shall ensure that such plant or plants are grown under control for such period as will ensure that such plant or plants are free from all pests and diseases before they are released.
