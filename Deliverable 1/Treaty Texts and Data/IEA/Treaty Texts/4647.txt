Source: http://www.fao.org/docrep/MEETING/005/W6063E.HTM
Editors note: two different sets of amendments were agreed to in 1997. Those below entered into force by means of tacit acceptance. Other amendments (see IEA #) entered into force only upon ratification (see https://iea.uoregon.edu/treaty-text/1997-amendments-1949-fisheriescounci... ). In the text below, deleted text is enclosed within [square brackets] and added language is enclosed within {curly braces}. One element of these amendments was to change the name of the GFCM from Council to Commission. See http://www.fao.org/Legal/treaties/003s-e.htm
"At its Twenty-second Session held in Rome from 13 to 16 October 1997, the GFCM adopted two sets of amendments which were approved by the FAO Council at its 113th Session (4-6 November 1997). The first set of amendments concerned changes inter alia to allow for regional economic integration organizations that are Members of FAO to become members of GFCM and to change the name of GFCM into "General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean". These amendments came into force upon the concurrence of the FAO Council and do not need any further procedure for acceptance." http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/legal/docs/003s-e.pdf, downloaded 20120428
