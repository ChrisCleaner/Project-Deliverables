At the 57th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Ulsan from 20-24 June 2005, no modifications were made to the provision for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons. No modifications were made to provisions for aboriginal subsistence catch limits, although Denmark (Greenland) voluntarily reduced the catch limit for the West Greenland Stock of fin whales from 19 to 10 for each of the years 2006 and 2007.
Only the following amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling are therefore necessary (changes in bold italics type):
Paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
Substitute the dates 2005/2006 pelagic season, 2006 coastal season, 2006 season, or 2006 as appropriate.
