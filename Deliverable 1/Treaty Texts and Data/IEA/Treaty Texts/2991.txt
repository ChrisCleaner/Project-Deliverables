CIRCULAR COMMUNICATION TO CONTRACTING GOVERNMENTS International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946 Amendments to the Schedule
At its 37th Annual Meeting, held in Bournemouth, UK, 15-19 July 1985, the International Whaling Commission adopted the following amendments to the Schedule:
A. SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS (changes and new wording underlined)
1. Amend Tables l, 2 and 3 as shown in the Appendix, to reflect the specific changes made in the classification of the stocks indicated. (referred to in paragraphs 10(a), (b) and (c).
2. Amend paragraph 13(b) as follows:
1. Delete sub-paragraph 13(b)(1), and re-number the succeeding subparagraphs.
2. Amend sub-paragraph 13(b)(2)(i) [old numbering] to read:
For each of the years 1985, 1986 and 1987, 262 whales may be struck. However, strikes not used in one year may be transferred to the subsequent year, provided that no more than 32 whales may be struck in any one year.
Footnote 2: Each year this figure will be reviewed and if necessary amended on the basis of the advice of the Scientific Committee.
3. Amend Table 1 as shown in the Appendix to reflect the aboriginal catch limits referred to in sub-paragraph 13(b)(4) [old numbering] for the West Greenland Stocks of minke and fin whales.
B. EDITORIAL AMENDMENTS
As a result of the coming into effect of paragraph 10(e):
1. Revise paragraph 11 as follows:
‘The number of baleen whales taken in the Southern Hemisphere in the 1985/86 pelagic season and the 1986 coastal season shall not exceed the limits shown in Tables 1 and 2.'
2. Revise paragraph 12 as follows:
‘The number of baleen whales taken in the North Pacific Ocean and dependent waters in 1986 and in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1986 shall not exceed the limits shown in Tables 1 and 2.'
3. Amend Tables 1 and 2 by the insertion of zero catch limits as shown in the Appendix.
[Note: In Table 3 the catch limit for the sperm whales in the Western Division of the North Pacific has not been changed to zero, because of the continuing operation of footnote 1, to which an objection has been lodged.]
4. Delete footnote 2 of Table 1 and footnote 1 of Table 2. 5. Delete all other footnotes to Tables 1, 2 and 3 which expire in 1985 or are now superseded.
C. NOTE BY THE SECRETARY
1. In Tables 1, 2 and 3 unclassified stocks are indicated by a dash. Other positions in the Tables have been filled with a dot to aid legibility.
These amendments become effective with respect to each Contracting Government ninety days following the date of this letter, in accordance with Article V of the Convention, unless any Contracting Government lodges an objection, in which case the procedure under Article V, paragraph 3 of the Convention will be followed.
The ninety days period will expire on 31 October 1985. In the absence of objections by that date the amendments will become effective. Contracting Governments will be notified accordingly.
Contracting Governments are reminded that Article V paragraph 3 of the Convention requires them to acknowledge receipt of this notification of amendments, a copy of which is being sent to each Commissioner.

CIRCULAR COMMUNICATION TO COMMISSIONERS AND CONTRACTING GOVERNMENTS Comments on and corrections to Amendments to the Schedule
The Secretary refers to the Circular Communication dated 2 August 1985 (ref: RG/EE/15720) setting out the amendments to the Schedule adopted at the 37th Annual Meeting of the Commission.
A number of points have arisen as a result of comments from and discussions with various Governments, which are set out below for the information of all members.
Corrections
1. The classification for the West Norway-Faroe Islands Stock of fin whales in Table 1 as PS should not be underlined. This was not a change.
2. The last sentence of the footnote to Table 3 in the Schedule dated January 1985 indicating that Japan has withdrawn its objection to footnote 1 of that Table with effect from 1 April 1988 was inadvertently omitted. This should continue in place.
Comments
3. The Government of Japan has requested that the following footnote should be added to Tables 1 and 2:
‘The catch limits of zero introduced in Tables 1 end 2 as editorial amendments as a result of the coming into effect of paragraph 10(e), are not binding upon the governments of the countries which lodged and have not withdrawn objections to the said paragraph.'
The Government of Japan considers that, although the above-mentioned editorial amendment is evident, it should, nevertheless, be included in order to prevent any misinterpretation.
4. The USSR requested clarification of the basis for not including a zero catch limit for sperm whales in Table 3 for the Western Division of the North Pacific. They stated that:
‘Footnote 1 to that table provides that no whales may be taken from that stock until catch limits including limitations on size and sex are established by the Commission. Such catch limits actually were set up in 1982 by inclusion of para. 10(e) into the Schedule. With zero limits there is no need in any other limitations. Thus para. 10(e) substitutes for the above footnote as from 1985/86 pelagic and 1986 coastal seasons.'
The Secretary pointed out the omission identified in point 2 above, and explained that it was in order to continue to include this notice of withdrawal that footnote 1 was retained. However, this is not appropriate if a zero catch figure is entered.
The USSR has responded in the following terms:
‘1. It should be reflected in the Schedule, that zero catch limits for 1985/1986 pelagic and 1986 coastal seasons, included in corresponding tables in accordance with para. 10(e), are not binding on USSR, Japan and Norway due to their objections to the above paragraph.
2. Zero catch limit for the western division of sperm whales stock in North Pacific should be included in Table 3 and footnote 1 and corresponding reference to it on bottom of the page deleted due to coming into effect of para. 10(e), with substitutes for footnote 1.'
The Secretary suggests that one solution to the problem would be to delete footnote 1 and add a revised footnote denoted by an asterisk to a zero entry in the following terms:
*In 1981 the Commission set no catch limit for this stock and added a footnote stating no whales may be taken from this stock until catch limits including any limitations on size and sex are established by the Commission.
The Government of Japan lodged an objection to this footnote within the prescribed period. This footnote came into force on 8 February 1982 but is not binding on Japan. The Government of Japan withdrew its objection on 11 December 1984 with effect from 1 April 1988. The footnote requested by the Government of Japan in para. 3 above should then be added in addition to Table 3, and the new footnote 2 renumbered 1. 5. The Secretary would be pleased to receive any comments from Governments on these points.

CIRCULAR COMMUNICATION TO CONTRACTING GOVERNMENTS
Norwegian Objection to an Amendment to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946
The Secretary refers to his Circular Communications dated 2 August and 26 September 1985 (refs: RG/EE/15720 and RG/EE/15775) notifying the amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946, adopted at the 37th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Bournemouth, UK, 15-19 July 1985. In accordance with Article V(3) of the Convention, the Government of Norway has lodged an objection to the classification of the Northeastern Atlantic stock of minke whales as a Protected Stock.
A copy of the full text containing the reasons given by the Government of Norway for lodging its objection is attached to this Circular.
According to the procedure laid down in Article V paragraph 3 of the Convention, this amendment (i.e. the classification of the Northeastern Atlantic stock of minke whales as a Protection Stock) shall not become effective with respect to any Contracting Government for an additional 90 days.
Any other Contracting Government may present objection to this amendment at any time prior to the expiration of the additional 90-day period, that is until 29 January 1986, or before the expiration of 30 days from the date of receipt by the Commission of the last objection received during the additional 90-day period whichever date shall be the later.
Thereafter, the amendment shall become effective with respect to all Contracting Governments which have not presented objection but shall not become effective with respect to any Contracting Government which has so objected until such date as the objection is withdrawn.
The Commission will notify each Contracting Government immediately upon receipt of each objection and withdrawal and each Contracting Government should acknowledge receipt of all notifications of amendments, objections and withdrawals.
The Secretary requests an acknowledgement of this Communication, a copy of which is also being sent to all Commissioners.

CIRCULAR COMMUNICATION TO CONTRACTING GOVERNMENTS Amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946 Adopted at the 37th Annual Meeting
The Secretary refers to his Circular Communications dated 2 August and 26 September 1985 (ref: RG/EE/15720 and RG/EE/15775) notifying the amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946, adopted at the 37th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Bournemouth, UK, 15-19 July 1985; and to the notification of an objection to the classification as a Protection Stock of the Northeastern stock of minke whales in the North Atlantic, presented by the Government of Norway and contained in the Circular Communication dated 29 October 1985 (ref: MH/EE/15800).
No further objections have been presented with respect to the classification of this stock within the second 90-day period specified under Article V paragraph 3 of the Convention.
This amendment therefore becomes effective with respect to all Contracting Governments which have not presented an objection from 29 January 1986, but is not effective with respect to the Government of Norway until such date as its objection is withdrawn.
The Convention requires (in Article V) that Contracting Governments shall acknowledge receipt of this notification of amendment of the Schedule, a copy of which is being sent to all Commissioners.
A revised edition of the Schedule incorporating the amendments adopted at the 37th Annual Meeting will be printed and distributed shortly.
Dr. R. Gambell Secretary to the Commission
