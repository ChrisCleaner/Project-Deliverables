Paragraphs 1 to 4 of regulation 12 are replaced by the following:
"1 Unless indicated otherwise, this regulation applies to every ship of 400 gross tonnage and above except that paragraph 3.5 of this regulation need only be applied as far as is reasonable and practicable to ships delivered on or before 31 December 1979, as defined in regulation 1.28.1.
2 Oil residue (sludge) may be disposed of directly from the oil residue (sludge) tank(s) to reception facilities through the standard discharge connection referred to in regulation 13, or to any other approved means of disposal of oil residue (sludge), such as an incinerator, auxiliary boiler suitable for burning oil residues (sludge) or other acceptable means which shall be annotated in item 3.2 of the Supplement to IOPP Certificate Form A or B.
3 Oil residue (sludge) tank(s) shall be provided and:
.1 shall be of adequate capacity, having regard to the type of machinery and length of voyage, to receive the oil residues (sludge) which cannot be dealt with otherwise in accordance with the requirements of this Annex;
.2 shall be provided with a designated pump that is capable of taking suction from the oil residue (sludge) tank(s) for disposal of oil residue (sludge) by means as described in regulation 12.2;
.3 shall have no discharge connections to the bilge system, oily bilge water holding tank(s), tank top or oily water separators, except that:
.1 the tank(s) may be fitted with drains, with manually operated self-closing valves and arrangements for subsequent visual monitoring of the settled water, that lead to an oily bilge water holding tank or bilge well, or an alternative arrangement, provided such arrangement does not connect directly to the bilge discharge piping system; and
.2 the sludge tank discharge piping and bilge-water piping may be connected to a common piping leading to the standard discharge connection referred to in regulation 13; the connection of both systems to the possible common piping leading to the standard discharge connection referred to in regulation 13 shall not allow for the transfer of sludge to the bilge system;
.4 shall not be arranged with any piping that has direct connection overboard, other than the standard discharge connection referred to in regulation 13; and
.5 shall be designed and constructed so as to facilitate their cleaning and the discharge of residues to reception facilities.
