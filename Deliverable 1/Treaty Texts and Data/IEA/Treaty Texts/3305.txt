AMENDMENTS TO THE BCH CODE
CHAPTER II
CARGO CONTAINMENT
1 The following new paragraph 2.14.3 is added after the existing paragraph 2.14.2:
"2.14.3 The controlled tank venting systems as provided in paragraph 2.14.2 above should consist of a primary and a secondary means of allowing full flow relief of vapour to prevent over-pressure or under-pressure in the event of failure of one means. Alternatively, the secondary means may consist of pressure sensors fitted in each tank with a monitoring system in the ship's cargo control room or position from which cargo operations are normally carried out. Such monitoring equipment should also provide an alarm facility which is activated by detection of over-pressure or under-pressure conditions within a tank. Ships should comply with the requirements of this paragraph by the date of the first scheduled dry-docking after 1 July 2002, but not later than 1 July 2005. However, the Administration may approve relaxation of this paragraph for ships of less than 500 gross tonnage."
2 The existing paragraphs 2.14.3 and 2.14.4 are renumbered as paragraphs 2.14.4 and 2.14.5.
