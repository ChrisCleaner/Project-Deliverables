ANNEX No. 3
REGULATIONS FOR THE REGULATION OF LAKE INARI BY MEANS OF THE KAITAKOSKI HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER STATION AND DAM
1. The flow of water from Lake Inari shall be so regulated that the water-level of the lake does not rise above 118.03 metres above sea level nor fall below 115.67 metres above sea level.
The levels relate to the benchmark of 118.04 metres above sea level which is carved in the rock at the end of the Nellimvuono inlet of Lake Inari and is marked on the map attached to the Agreement of 29 April 1959 between the Government of the USSR, the Government of Norway and the Government of Finland concerning the regulation of Lake Inari by means of the Kaitakoski hydro-electric power station and dam.
2. The flow of water from Lake Inari shall be continuous within the limits of a daily mean discharge of 120 to 240 cubic metres per second on condition that the water-level of Lake Inari does not rise above 118.03 metres above sea level nor fall below 115.67 metres above sea level and that the rate of discharge at the Rajakoski hydro-electric power station can fluctuate within a daily range of 80 to 240 cubic metres per second.
With a view to preparing Lake Inari to receive the spring flood, preventing any rise above the maximum permissible water-level of the lake and limiting the volume of flood discharge and the flood levels on the river Paatsjoki below the Rajakoski hydro-electric power station, the flow of water from Lake Inari shall be regulated on the basis of forecasts and recommendations drawn up by the Finnish Ministry, in accordance with the following conditions:
(a) The water-level of Lake Inari shall be lowered to a level not exceeding 116.53 metres above sea level by 1 May. If the forecasts indicate that the spring flood will be very heavy, the water-level of Lake Inari shall be reduced to below 116.53 metres above sea level by 1 May; however, during the period from the beginning of January to the end of April the discharge from the lake shall not exceed 280 cubic metres per second;
(b) After 1 May the discharge of water from Lake Inari may be gradually increased but shall not exceed 450 cubic metres per second before the water-level of Lake Inari has risen to 118.03 metres above sea level.
If in the case of very heavy floods the water-level of Lake Inari threatens to rise above 118.03 metres above sea level, the rate of discharge may, as an exceptional measure, be increased up to 500 cubic metres per second when the water-level reaches 117.98 metres above sea level. This shall be the maximum permissible rate of discharge;
(c) When the water-level of Lake Inari falls to 116.28 metres above sea level, the rate of discharge may be reduced to 75 cubic metres per second, and when the level falls below 115.83 metres above sea level, the rate may be reduced to 45 cubic metres per second. This shall be the minimum permissible rate of discharge.
3. For the purpose of allowing the machinery of any hydro-electric power station on the river Paatsjoki to be overhauled, the discharge of water from the lake may be reduced to 85 cubic metres per second for not more than 15 days a year. Between 1 June and 15 September such reduction shall be allowed only in cases of urgent necessity.
4. In special circumstances or when the spillway of the Rajakoski hydro-electric power station must be inspected and repaired, the management of that station may stop, the flow of water at Rajakoski completely for not more than eight hours, provided that the Norwegian frontier authorities are given notice thereof, in advance if possible.
5. The rate of discharge of 120 to 240 cubic metres per second referred to in paragraph 2, first sub-paragraph, above shall be maintained in connexion with the floating of timber in the river Paatsjoki. In case of special need the daily mean discharge shall, on the basis of a request made by the Finnish or the Norwegian Party ten days in advance, be maintained at not less than 150 cubic metres per second for a total period of not more than 30 days a year. The requested rate of discharge must not coincide with the overhaul of the machinery of hydro-electric power stations on the river Paatsjoki.
6. The rate of discharge may not be suddenly increased or decreased to such an extent as to be prejudicial to private or public interests.
In years when there is an abundance of water, the Finnish Ministry shall communicate to the Norwegian Ministry forecasts concerning the amount of water and recommendations for its discharge.
7. The Finnish Ministry shall supply to the Kaitakoski hydro-electric power station and to the future Skogfoss hydro-electric power station in good time forecasts of the volume of run-off into Lake Inari expected during the periods 1 November to 30 April, 1 May to 31 July and 1 August to 31 October, special forecasts concerning summer floods and, in case of necessity, new forecasts in the course of the said periods. In connexion with the discharge of water, the Kaitakoski hydro-electric power station shall follow the recommendations given by the Finnish Ministry on the basis of the said forecasts.
8. The water-level of the control reservoir shall be determined by means of the automatic water-level gauge which is maintained in the Nellimvuono inlet of Lake Inari by the Finnish Ministry.
The discharge of water from Lake Inari shall be calculated daily in cubic metres per second from the flow of water through the turbines and dam-sluices of the Kaitakoski hydro-electric power station. For this purpose the USSR Ministry shall as soon as possible prepare at its own expense graphs showing the recorded flow of water through the turbines, the flood-gate and the timber-floating gate. Copies of these graphs shall be supplied to the Finnish Ministry and the Norwegian Ministry. Until such time as the said graphs have been prepared, the USSR Ministry shall determine the flow of water from Lake Inari on the basis of readings taken at hydro-electric power stations below Kaitakoski.
9. The Finnish Ministry shall keep a daily log of the mean readings of the water-level gauge in the Nellimvuono inlet.
The USSR Ministry shall keep a daily log of the mean daily discharge of water from Lake Inari and also of the mean readings of the water-level gauge to be installed by the USSR Ministry at its own expense in the river Paatsjoki above the Kaitakoski hydro-electric power station. After the graphs referred to in paragraph 8, second sub-paragraph, have been prepared, the USSR Ministry shall keep a separate daily log of the mean flow of water through the turbines of the Kaitakoski hydro-electric power station and a separate daily log of the corresponding discharge through the dam-sluices of that hydro-electric power station.
The Norwegian Ministry shall keep a daily log of the mean levels of Lake BjÃ¶rnvatn. Extracts from the logs and copies of the water-level graphs shall be communicated to the other Parties on request.
10. For the purpose of forecasting the volume of run-off into Lake Inari, the Finnish Ministry shall make the necessary measurements of precipitation.
The USSR Ministry and the Norwegian Ministry shall also make the necessary measurements of precipitation.
11. The USSR Ministry shall maintain in good condition the gate for timber-floating at the Kaitakoski dam.
The USSR Ministry shall, by agreement with the Finnish Ministry, participate in such measures as may in future be found necessary to preserve the stocks of fish.
12. The levels prescribed in these Regulations are given according to the Finnish system of altitude measurement which, according to the results of the levelling carried out by the Soviet Party in 1956, differs by minus 1.87 m from the altitude system used by the Norwegian Party on the section of the river Paatsjoki extending from the Rajakoski hydro-electric power station to the Barents Sea.
