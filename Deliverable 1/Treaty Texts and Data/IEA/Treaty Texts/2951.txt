Source: http://www.oceanlaw.net/texts/epta.htm
The Contracting Parties to this Agreement:
Resolved to cooperate for the purpose of ensuring the conservation and rational utilization of tuna resources in the Eastern Pacific Ocean,
Bearing in mind that tuna cover a broad area which, in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, includes jurisdictional zones of a varying nature declared by the coastal States and a considerable portion of the seas in which coastal States do not exercise any jurisdiction,
Recognizing that a tuna conservation regime for the Eastern Pacific Ocean cannot be effective and equitable unless it is comprehensive and has the participation of all States that fish tuna in that region an a meaningful scale in relation to conservation requirements,
Convinced that it is essential to establish, pending conclusion of a comprehensive regional tuna conservation regime, an interim regime, taking into account the jurisdictional zones declared by many coastal States of the Eastern Pacific Ocean as well as the highly migratory character of tuna,
Have agreed as follows,
Article I
The Contracting Parties agree to establish an interim regime for the management of fishing activities of tuna vessels in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, based on a scheme for granting licences in the region, which guarantees rational exploitation of the resources and equitable access to the fishing areas.

For the purpose of this Agreement, the Contracting Parties agree that:
A - "Coastal States" means States bordering the area described in paragraph B of this Article.
B - The "Agreement Area" means the following: From the point on the mainland where the parallel of 40oN latitude intersects the coast westward along the parallel of 40oN latitude to 40oN latitude by 125oW longitude, thence southerly along the meridian of 125oW longitude to 20oN latitude by 125oW longitude, then easterly along the parallel of 20oN latitude to 20oN latitude by 120oW longitude, thence southerly along the meridian of 120oW longitude to 5oN latitude by 120oW longitude, thence easterly along the parallel of 5oN latitude to 5oN latitude by 110oW longitude, thence southerly along the meridian of 110oW longitude to 10o5 latitude by 110oW longitude, thence easterly along the parallel of 10oS latitude to 10oS latitude by 90oW longitude, thence southerly along the meridian of 90oW longitude to 30oS latitude by 90oW longitude thence easterly along the parallel of 30oS latitude to the point on the mainland where the parallel intersects the coast, excluding the areas within 12 nautical miles of the baseline from which the breadth of territorial sea Is measured and those areas within 200 nautical miles of the baseline of coastal States not signatories to this Agreement, measured from the same baseline. The Agreement area may be adjusted according to the provisions of Article III(B).
