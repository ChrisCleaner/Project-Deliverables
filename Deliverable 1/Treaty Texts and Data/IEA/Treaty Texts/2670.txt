HAVING RESOLVED to promote the development of the production and uses of nuclear energy in the Member countries of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (hereinafter referred to as the "Organisation") by co-operation between these countries and the harmonisation of national measures;
CONSIDERING that the joint action undertaken to this end in the Organisation is intended to develop the European nuclear industry for purely peaceful ends and must not further any military purpose;

a) The object of the security control is to ensure that:
i) the operation of joint undertakings established by two or more Governments or by nationals of two or more countries on the initiative or with the assistance of the Agency and
ii) materials, equipment and services made available by the Agency or under its supervision, by virtue of agreements concluded with the Governments concerned shall not further any military purpose.

With respect to any undertaking or facility subject to control, the Agency shall have the following rights and duties to the extent determined by the security regulations provided for in Article 8:
a) to examine the design of specialised equipment and facilities, including nuclear reactors, for the sole purpose of ensuring that the control can be effectively exercised as provided for in the present Convention;
b) to approve the means to be used for the chemical processing of irradiated materials solely to ensure that the object defined in Article 1 shall be achieved;

d) to call for and receive progress reports.
Article 4
a) Special fissionable materials recovered or obtained from source or special fissionable materials subject to control shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes, under the control of the Agency, for research or in reactors specified by the Government or Governments concerned.
b) Any excess of any special fissionable materials recovered or produced over what is needed for the above-stated uses shall remain subject to the control of the Agency, which may require it to be deposited with the Agency, or in other premises controlled or which may be controlled by the Agency, provided that thereafter at the request of the parties concerned special fissionable materials so deposited shall be returned promptly to the parties concerned for use under the same provisions as stated above.
Article 5
a) The Agency shall have the right and responsibility to send into territory under the jurisdiction of Governments party to the present Convention inspectors, designated by it after consultation with the Government or Governments concerned, who shall have access at all times to all places and data and to any person who by reason of his occupation deals with materials, equipment, or facilities subject to control, as necessary to account for source and special fissionable materials subject to control and to determine whether there is compliance with the obligations arising from the present Convention and from any agreement concluded by the Agency with the Government or Governments concerned.
b) If these obligations are not observed, the Agency may request that the steps necessary to remedy the situation be taken; if this is not done within a reasonable time, the Agency may prescribe one or more of the following measures:

ANNEX
INTERPRETATION RELATING TO ARTICLE 1
The provisions of Article 1 a) ii) relating to "services made available by the Agency or under its supervision" refer to the special aid which might be granted to a country by virtue of a special agreement entered into with the Government in question. They do not have the effect of extending the field of application of Article 2 by creating a right of pursuit involving the control of the activities of persons who have collaborated in joint undertakings or of the use of the knowledge which the participants in these undertakings have acquired.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries, duly empowered, have signed the present Convention.
DONE in Paris, this twentieth day of December Nineteen Hundred and Fifty Seven, in the French, English, German, Italian and Dutch languages in a single copy which shall remain deposited with the Secretary-General of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation by whom certified copies will be communicated to all Signatories.
