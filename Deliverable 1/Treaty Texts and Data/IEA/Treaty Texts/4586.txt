[The Amendments were adopted at the fourth meeting of the Conference of the Parties, held in Rome from 15 to 17 November 2006 and entered into force for all Parties to the Convention on 19 March 2008. -- https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ShowMTDSGDetails.aspx?src=UNTSONLINE&amp;tabid...
The Conference of the Parties,
Recognizing the need to update the categories of substances and preparations and the named substances and their threshold quantities, as contained in annex I to the Convention, for the purposes of defining hazardous activities, in light of new scientific information and the lessons learned from past industrial accidents,
Bearing in mind its decision to undertake a review of the hazardous substances and their quantities as contained in annex I and its decision 2004/4 on establishing the Working Group on the Development of the Convention,
Acknowledging the proposal to amend annex I drawn up by the Working Group on Development on the basis of a thorough review (for reference see the minutes of two meetings: WGD2/27 June 2005 and WGD4/7 April 2006) and supported by the Bureau,
Amends annex I to the Convention on hazardous substances for the purposes of defining hazardous activities as contained in the appendix below.
Appendix

Notes
[1.] Indicative criteria. In the absence of other appropriate criteria, Parties may use the following criteria when classifying substances or preparations for the purposes of Part I of this annex. Mixtures and preparations shall be treated in the same way as the pure substance unless they no longer exhibit equivalent properties and are not capable of producing transboundary effects.
[2.] FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS: substances and preparations having a flash point equal to or greater than 21°C and less than or equal to 55°C, supporting combustion.
[3.] HIGHLY FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS
(a) Substances and preparations which may become hot and finally catch fire in contact with air at ambient temperature without any input of energy (are spontaneously flammable in air);
(b) Substances and preparations, which have a flashpoint lower than 55°C and remain liquid under pressure, where particular processing conditions, such as high pressure or high temperature, may create major accident hazards; and
(c) Substances and preparations having a flash point lower than 21°C and which are not extremely flammable.
[4.] EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE GASES AND LIQUIDS
(a) Liquid substances and preparations which have a flash point lower than 0°C and whose boiling point (or, in the case of a boiling range, initial boiling point) at normal pressure is less than or equal to 35°C;
(b) Gases which are flammable in contact with air at ambient temperature and pressure, and which are in a gaseous or supercritical state; and
(c) Flammable and highly flammable liquid substances and preparations maintained at a temperature above their boiling point.
[5.] TOXIC: substances with properties corresponding to those in table 1 or table 2 and having physical and chemical properties capable of creating industrial accident hazards (LD - lethal dose; LC - lethal concentration).
TABLE 1
[Editor: This table had formatting that was more complicated than could be readily reproduced here. For these tables, please see the original source document, as identified at the top of this document.]
TABLE 2
Discriminating dose mg/kg body weight = 5
where the acute oral toxicity in animals of the substance has been determined using the fixed-dose procedure.
[6.] VERY TOXIC: substances with properties corresponding to those in table 3 or table 4 and which, owing to their physical and chemical properties, are capable of creating industrial accident hazards (LD - lethal dose; LC - lethal concentration).
TABLE 3
[Editor: This table had formatting that was more complicated than could be readily reproduced here. For these tables, please see the original source document, as identified at the top of this document.]
TABLE 4
Discriminating dose mg/kg body weight &lt; 5 where the acute oral toxicity in animals of the substance has been determined using the fixed-dose procedure.
[7.] OXIDIZING: substances which give rise to highly exothermic reactions when in contact with other substances, particularly flammable substances.
[8.] EXPLOSIVE
(a) Substances or preparations which create the risk of an explosion by shock, friction, fire or other sources of ignition;
(b) Substances or preparations which create extreme risks of explosion by shock, friction, fire or other sources of ignition; or
(c) Substances, preparations or articles covered by Class 1 of the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (UN/ADR), concluded on 30 September 1957, as amended.
Included in this definition are pyrotechnics, which for the purposes of this Convention are defined as substances (or mixtures of substances) designated to produce heat, light, sound, gas or smoke or a combination of such effects through self-sustained exothermic chemical reactions. Substances and articles of Class 1 are classified in any of the divisions 1.1 to 1.6 in accordance with the UN/ADR classification scheme. The divisions concerned are:
Division 1.1: "Substances and articles which have a mass explosion hazard (a mass explosion is an explosion which affects almost the entire load virtually instantaneously)."
Division 1.2: "Substances and articles which have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard."
Division 1.3: "Substances and articles which have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or both, but not a mass explosion hazard:
(i) combustion of which gives rise to considerable radiant heat; or
(ii) which burn one after another, producing minor blast or projection effects or both."
Division 1.4: "Substances and articles which present only a slight risk in the event of ignition or initiation during carriage. The effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire shall not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of virtually the entire contents of the package."
Division 1.5: "Very insensitive substances having a mass explosion hazard which are so insensitive that there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal conditions of carriage. As a minimum requirement they shall not explode in the external fire test."
Division 1.6: "Extremely insensitive articles which do not have a mass explosion hazard. The articles contain only extremely insensitive detonating substances and demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or propagation. The risk is limited to the explosion of a single article."
Also included in this definition are explosive or pyrotechnic substances or preparations contained in articles. In the case of articles containing explosive or pyrotechnic substances or preparations, if the quantity of the substance or preparation contained is known, that quantity shall be considered for the purposes of this Convention. If the quantity is not known, then, for the purposes of this Convention, the whole article shall be treated as explosive.

(b) 15.75% by weight or less and unrestricted combustible materials;
and which are capable of self-sustaining decomposition according to the UN Trough Test (see United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods: Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part III, subsection 38.2).
