The Governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama, through their Plenipotentiaries to the
Fifth Conference of Ministers of Agriculture of Central America, Mexico, l Panama, which took place in San Salvador, Republic of El Salvador,
Considering:
That devastating sicknesses and pests exist which attack domestic plants and animals and which, once they appear in one country, may easily and quickly spread to the neighboring countries;
That, in order to safeguard their peoples against the serious economic damamage occasioned by these sicknesses and pests, a general co-operative plan by the Governments is necessary;
That the International Committee for Co-ordination of Anti-Locust activities in Central America-Mexico (CICLA) has demonstrated the effectiveness of this type of co-operation;
That support by those countries for the maintenance of an administratively and technically qualified International Organization of Animal and [ant Health would be very economical in relation to the great losses in agriculture and stock which can result from infestations of locusts (Schistocerca sp.); coffee mildew or rust (Hemileia vastatrix), (Hemileia coffeicola); coffee drill (Stephanoderes coffeae), (Stephanoderes hampei); A. also Foot and Mouth disease, Contagious Abortion and other similar scourges;
That the Consultative Regional Conference on Foot and Mouth disease which met in Panama in August 1951 considered thoroughly the problem of the above diseases and arrived at conclusions worthy of being taken into account;
That modern means of communication encourage the exchange of persons and products between countries which also greatly assists in the spread of pests and contagious sicknesses of plants and animals;
That International Organizations like the FAO and OAS to which the countries at this Conference belong, have on various occasions expressed their sympathy with the International Regional Organization of Animal and Plant Health of Central America, Mexico and Panama, and have indicated their ability to contribute effective support;
That effective co-operation could also be requested from the Foreign
1 OIRSA publication, translated from the original Spanish by D.P. Xydis.
Operations Administration of the United States of America through Program of Co-operative Technical Assistance;
That in previous Conferences of Ministers of Agriculture the need to create a wider organization with more extended functions than the International Committee for Co-ordination of Anti-Locust Activities, (CICLA) has been expressed;
That the taking of preventive measures against such serious common dangers cannot be deferred;
Have agreed as follows:
