Following a proposal by Monaco to adjust annex II to the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution on Further Reduction on Sulphur Emissions, by including its name, together with sulphur emission levels for 1980 and 1990, and sulphur emission ceilings and percentage emission reductions for 2000, 2005 and 2010, the Executive Body, at its nineteenth session, adopted the proposed adjustment to annex II in accordance with article 11 of the Protocol, to enable Monaco's accession (ECE/EB.AIR/75, para. 13). As a consequence, annex II to the Protocol has been replaced as below. In a letter dated 18 January 2002, the secretariat informed the Parties about the adjustment. In accordance with article 11 of the Protocol, the adoption of the adjustment became effective on the ninetieth day following the date of the said letter, that is to say on 18 April 2002.
Documents prepared under the auspices or at the request of the Executive Body for the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution for GENERAL circulation should be considered provisional unless APPROVED by the Executive Body.
Annex II
SULPHUR EMISSION CEILINGS AND PERCENTAGE EMISSION REDUCTIONS
The sulphur emission ceilings listed in the table below give the obligations referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 2 of the present Protocol. The 1980 and 1990 emission levels and the percentage emission reductions listed are given for information purposes only.
[Editor: This table had formatting that was more complicated than could be readily reproduced here. For these tables, please see the original source document, as identified at the top of this document.]
Notes
a/ If, in a given year before 2005, a Party finds that, due to a particularly cold winter, a particularly dry summer and an unforeseen short-term loss of capacity in the power supply system, domestically or in a neighbouring country, it cannot comply with its obligations under this annex, it may fulfil those obligations by averaging its national annual sulphur emissions for the year in question, the year preceding that year and the year following it, provided that the emission level in any single year is not more than 20% above the sulphur emission ceiling. The reason for exceedance in any given year and the method by which the three-year average figure will be achieved, shall be reported to the Implementation Committee.
b/ For Greece and Portugal percentage emission reductions given are based on the sulphur emission ceilings indicated for the year 2000.
c/ European part within the EMEP area.
