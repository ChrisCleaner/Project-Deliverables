PREAMBLE
The Parties to this Convention:
Recognizing the rights and duties of States established in international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, relating to the conservation and management of living marine resources;
Inspired by the principles contained in the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development;
Considering the principles and recommendations set forth in the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing adopted by the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations in its 28th Session (1995);
Recalling that Agenda 21, adopted in 1992 by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, recognizes the need to protect and restore endangered marine species and to conserve their habitats;
Understanding that, in accordance with the best available scientific evidence, species of sea turtles in the Americas are threatened or endangered, and that some of these species may face an imminent risk of extinction;
Acknowledging the importance of having the States in the Americas adopt an agreement to address this situation through an instrument that also facilitates the participation of States from other regions interested in the worldwide protection and conservation of sea turtles, taking into account the widely migratory nature of these species;
Recognizing that sea turtles are subject to capture, injury or mortality as a direct or indirect result of human-related activities;
Considering that coastal zone management measures are indispensable for protecting populations of sea turtles and their habitats;
Recognizing the individual environmental, socio-economic and cultural conditions in the States in the Americas;
Recognizing that sea turtles migrate widely throughout marine areas and that their protection and conservation require cooperation and coordination among States within the range of such species;
Recognizing also the programs and activities that certain States are currently carrying out for the protection and conservation of sea turtles and their habitats;
Desiring to establish, through this Convention, appropriate measures for the protection and conservation of sea turtles throughout their range in the Americas, as well as their habitats;
Have agreed as follows:

PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION OF SEA TURTLE HABITATS
Each Party shall consider and may adopt, as necessary and in accordance with its laws, regulations, policies, plans and programs, measures to protect and conserve sea turtle habitats within its territory and in maritime areas with respect to which it exercises sovereignty, sovereign rights or jurisdiction, such as:
1. Requiring assessments of the environmental impact of marine and coastal development activities that may affect sea turtle habitats, including: dredging of canals and estuaries; construction of sea walls, piers and marinas; extraction of raw materials; operation of aquaculture facilities; siting of industrial facilities; use of reefs; deposit of dredged materials and trash; and other related activities;
2. Managing and, when necessary, regulating the use of beaches and coastal dunes with respect to the location and design of buildings, the use of artificial lighting and the transit of vehicles in nesting areas;
3. Establishing protected areas and taking other measures to regulate the use of areas where sea turtles nest or regularly occur, including permanent or temporary closures, modification of fishing gear, and, to the greatest extent practicable, restrictions on vessel traffic.
ANNEX III
USE OF TURTLE EXCLUDER DEVICES
1. "Shrimp trawl vessel" means any vessel used to catch shrimp species with trawl nets.
2. "Turtle Excluder Device" or "TED" means a device designed to increase the selectivity of shrimp trawl nets in order to reduce the incidental capture of sea turtles in shrimp fishing operations.
3. Each Party shall require shrimp trawl vessels subject to its jurisdiction that operate within the Convention Area to use recommended TEDs that are properly installed and functional.
4. Each Party, in accordance with the best available scientific evidence, may allow exceptions to use of TEDs as required in Paragraph 3 only in the following circumstances:
a. For shrimp trawl vessels whose nets are retrieved exclusively by manual rather than mechanical means, and shrimp vessels with trawl nets for which no TEDs have been developed. A Party allowing such exception shall adopt other measures to reduce the incidental mortality of sea turtles that are equally effective and that do not undermine efforts to achieve the objective of this Convention, such as limits on tow times, closed seasons and closed fishing areas where sea turtles occur.
b. For shrimp trawl vessels:
(i) exclusively using other trawl gear that has been demonstrated not to pose a risk of incidental mortality of sea turtles; or
(ii) operating under conditions where there is no likelihood of interaction with sea turtles;
provided that the Party allowing such exception provides to the other Parties, either directly or through the Secretariat, if established, documented scientific evidence demonstrating the lack of such risk or likelihood;
c. For shrimp trawl vessels conducting scientific research under a program approved by the Party;
d. Where the presence of algae, seaweed, debris, or other special conditions, temporary or permanent, make the use of TEDs impracticable in a specific area, provided that:
(i) a Party allowing this exception shall adopt other measures to protect sea turtles in the area in question, such as limits on tow times;
(ii) only in extraordinary emergency situations of a temporary nature may a Party allow this exception to apply to more than a small number of the vessels subject to its jurisdiction that would otherwise be required to use TEDs pursuant to this Annex;
(iii) a Party allowing this exception shall provide to the other Parties, either directly or through the Secretariat, if established, information concerning the special conditions and the number of shrimp trawl vessels operating in the area in question.
5. Any Party may comment upon information provided by any other Party pursuant to Paragraph 4. Where appropriate, the Parties shall seek guidance from the Consultative Committee and the Scientific Committee to resolve differences of view. If the Consultative Committee so recommends, and the Parties agree, a Party that has allowed an exception pursuant to Paragraph 4 shall reconsider the allowance or extent of such an exception.
6. The Parties may, by consensus, approve other exceptions to the use of TEDs as required in Paragraph 3, in accordance with the best available scientific evidence and based on recommendations of the Consultative Committee and the Scientific Committee, to account for circumstances warranting special consideration, provided that such exceptions do not undermine efforts to achieve the objective of this Convention.
7. For the purposes of this Convention:
a. Recommended TEDs shall be those TEDs determined by the Parties, with advice from the Consultative Committee, to reduce the incidental capture of sea turtles in shrimp trawl fishing operations to the greatest extent practicable;
b. At their first meeting, the Parties shall develop an initial list of recommended TEDs, which they may modify at subsequent meetings;
c. Until the first meeting of the Parties, each Party shall determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, which TEDs to require for use by shrimp trawl vessels subject to its jurisdiction in order to reduce the incidental capture of sea turtles in shrimp trawl fishing operations to the greatest extent practicable, based on consultations with other Parties.
8. At the request of any other Party or of the Consultative Committee or the Scientific Committee, each Party shall provide, either directly or through the Secretariat, if established, scientific information relevant to the achievement of the objective of this Convention.
