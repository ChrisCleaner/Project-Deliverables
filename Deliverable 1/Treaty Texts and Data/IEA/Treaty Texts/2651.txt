(1) In paragraph 4, insert the following two new sub-paragraphs, the existing paragraph numbered 4 being renumbered 4(3):
"4 (1) It is forbidden to kill or attempt to kill blue whales in the North Atlantic Ocean for a period of 5 years.
(2) It is forbidden to use a whale catcher attached to a factory ship or to a land station for the purpose of killing or attempting to kill blue whales for a period of 5 years in the North Pacific Ocean between 20° North Latitude and 66° North Latitude eastward of a line running south from 66° North Latitude along the meridian 168°58'22.69" West Longitude to 65°15' North Latitude; thence southwestward along a great circle course to the intersection of 51° North Latitude and 167° East Longitude; thence southeastward along a great circle course to the intersection of 48° North Latitude and 180° Longitude; thence south along the meridian 180° Longitude to 20° North Latitude."
(2) In paragraph 6, insert the following sub-paragraphs, the existing paragraph numbered 6 being now re-numbered 6(3):
"6 (1) It is forbidden to kill or attempt to kill humpback whales in the North Atlantic Ocean for a period of 5 years.
(2) It is forbidden to kill or attempt to kill humpback whales in the waters south of 40° South Latitude between 0° Longitude and 70° West Longitude for a period of 5 years."
(3) Paragraph 6 now to be re-numbered 6(3) shall read as follows:
"It is forbidden to use a whale catcher attached to a factory ship for the purpose of killing or attempting to kill humpback whales in any waters south of 40° South Latitude except on 1, 2, 3 and 4 February in any year."
(4) In paragraph 7(a), for "2 January" substitute "7 January." Omit the proviso at end and insert the words "and no such whale catcher shall be used for the purpose of killing or attempting to kill blue whales before 21 January in any year." Paragraph 7(a) as so amended will then read as follows, the new words being italicised:
"7 (a) It is forbidden to use a whale catcher attached to a factory ship for the purpose of killing or attempting to kill baleen whales (excluding minke whales) in any waters south of 40° South Latitude, except during the period 7 January to 7 April, following, both days inclusive; and no such whale catcher shall be used for the purpose of killing or attempting to kill blue whales before 21 January in any year."
(5) Insert a new sub-paragraph 7(b) as follows:
"7 (b) It is forbidden to use a whale catcher attached to a factory ship for the purpose of killing or attempting to kill sperm or minke whales, except as permitted by the Contracting Governments in accordance with sub-paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this paragraph."
The existing sub-paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) will then become (c), (d) and (e) respectively.
(6) In paragraph 9(b), for the words "60 feet (18.3 metres)" read "57 feet (17.4 metres)."
(7) At end of paragraph 10(d) add the following words:
"Except that a separate open season may be declared for any land station used for the taking or treating of minke whales which is located in an area having oceanographic conditions clearly distinguishable from those of the area in which are located the other land stations used for the taking or treating of minke whales under the jurisdiction of the same Contracting Government; but the declaration of a separate open season by virtue of the provisions of this sub-paragraph shall not cause thereby the period of time covering the open seasons declared by the same Contracting Government to exceed nine continuous months of any twelve months."
