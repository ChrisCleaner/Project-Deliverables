Annex I
POLLUTION ABATEMENT THROUGH SOURCE CONTROL
With regard to the issue of pollution abatement through source control referred to in Article IV of this Protocol, consideration should be given to the control and progressive replacement of products, installations and industrial or other processes causing significant pollution to the Marine Environment. In this regard, particular attention will be given, but not limited, to the following factors:
a) Curtailment and/or regulation of import, transportation, manufacturing or processing of certain harmful substances.
b) Change of raw materials.
c) Change of manufacturing processes.
d) Good operating and housekeeping practices.
e) Segregation of waste streams and minimization of pollutant dilution prior to treatment.
f) Recovery, re-use and recycling.
The programmes, measures and the timetables required for the implementation of source control will be developed and priorities allocated on the basis of the results of on-going assessment studies.
Problem areas of Regional interest, where cost effective measures can be implemented, will receive attention for the purpose of establishing general management schemes. Such areas are, for example, the collection, treatment, and proper disposal of spent lubricating oils, blood and paunch from slaughterhouses, the control of fuel combustion processes and the implementation of source control in selected processes within large industries.
Annex II
PROMOTION OF JOINT AND/OR COMBINED EFFLUENT TREATMENT
Without undue prejudice to the multifaceted constraints that often govern the selection of the location of new industries, a programme will be undertaken, as referred to in Article VI of this Protocol, to promote:
a) agglomeration of industries in a way that enhances the possibility of joint effluent pretreatment and/or treatment, as the need may be;
b) location within the limits of city sewer systems of certain types of industry so as to enhance combined treatment of industrial and domestic wastes.
Promotion of joint and/or combined effluent treatment, if properly planned, could result in greatly reduced treatment, monitoring and enforcement costs as well as in increased treatment reliabilities. To this end, Regional guidelines and criteria will be developed dealing with topics of common interest, such as:
- the compatibility of effluent from different sources;
- pretreatment requirements prior to discharge into domestic and/or industrial sewer systems;
- cost sharing for the construction and operation of treatment plants.
Such guidelines and criteria will assist Contracting States in developing their own specific programmes and measures. While initial plans may deal with the location problem of new industries, the end objective will be the progressive attraction of existing selected small industries as the infrastructure and facilities are developed in the designated areas.
Annex III
GUIDELINES, REGULATIONS AND PERMITS FOR THE RELEASE OF WASTES
1. With a view to guidelines, standards or criteria, as well as to regulations, programmes, measures, and discharge permits for release of wastes referred to in Article VI of this Protocol, particular attention will be given, inter alia, to the following factors:
a) Regional regulations for the waste discharge and/or degree of treatment should be specific for each kind of source and, if necessary, may be different between existing and new sources. Their development should be based on treatment technology, cost and nature of pollutants considerations, as well as on an overview of the state of the environment in the Protocol Area.
b) Regional guidelines and, as appropriate, standards or criteria should be developed for the quality of sea water used for specific purposes.
c) For areas where the water quality standards for the intended use cannot be achieved through the implementation of the above Regional regulations, stricter local regulations for the waste discharge and/or degree of treatment should be developed. Such local regulations will apply to the specific sources in the areas under consideration.
d) Regional regulations along with the programmes, measures and the timetables required for the implementation should be developed on a priority basis, inter alia, for the following types of wastes:
i) Ballast water, slops, bilges and other oily water discharges generated by land-based reception facilities and ports through loading and repair operations.
ii) Brine water and mud discharges from oil and gas drilling and extraction activities from land-based sources.
iii) Oily and toxic sludges from crude oil and refined products storage facilities.
iv) Effluents and emissions from petroleum refineries.
v) Effluents and emissions from petrochemical and fertilizer plants.
vi) Toxic effluents and emissions from industries such as chlor-alkali, primary aluminium production, pesticides, insecticides, and lead recovery plants.
vii) Emissions from natural gas flaring and desulfurization plants.
viii) Dust emissions from major industrial sources, such as cement, lime, asphalt and concrete plants.
ix) Effluents and emissions from power and de-salination plants.
x) Wastes generated from coastal development activities which may have a significant impact on the Marine Environment.
xi)Sewage and solid wastes.
e) As the diagram 1 [not reproduced] attached to this Annex illustrates, pollution abatement is an iterative process. Pollution abatement action will start from high priority measures, which will be selected to be pragmatic, cost-effective, while addressing the most critical environmental problems as perceived today. The monitoring programme as specified in Article VII of this Protocol, will be providing the necessary feed-back for the required corrective action by yielding the database for assessing the effectiveness of implemented programmes, the current state of the environment and its trends. Corrective action, whenever required, will be taken through periodic updates of the regulations, programmes and measures and review of the conditions in discharge permits, in accordance with the provisions of Articles IV and VI of this Protocol.
2. Provisions for establishing criteria governing the issue of permits for the discharging of waste matter in the Marine Environment, should also take into consideration inter alia the following:
a) Characteristics and Composition of Waste
i) Type and size of waste source, e.g. industrial process;
ii) Type of waste (origin, average composition);
iii) Form of waste (solid, liquid, sludge, slurry);
iv) Total amount (volume discharged, e.g. per year);
v) Discharge pattern (continuous, intermittent, seasonably variable, etc.);
vi) Concentrations with respect to major constituents;
vii) Properties: physical, e.g. solubility and density; chemical and biochemical, e.g. oxygen demand, nutrients; and biological, e.g. presence of viruses, bacteria, yeast, parasites;
viii) Toxicity;
ix) Persistence: physical, chemical and biological;
x) Accumulation and biotransformation in biological materials or sediments;
xi) Susceptibility to physical, chemical and biochemical changes and interaction in the aquatic environment with other dissolved organic and inorganic materials;
xii) Probability of producing taints or other changes reducing marketability of resources, e.g. fish, shellfish, etc.
b) Characteristics of Discharge Site and Receiving Marine Environment
i) Hydrographic, meteorological, geological, biological and topographical characteristics of the discharge site.
ii) Location and type of the discharge (outfall, canal, outlet, etc.) and its relation to other areas, e.g. amenity areas, spawning, nursery and fishing areas, shellfish grounds and exploitable resources.
iii) Rate of disposal per specific period, e.g. quantity per day, per week and per month.
iv) Initial dilution achieved at the point of discharge into the receiving marine environment.
v) Methods of packaging and containment, if any.
vi)Dispersion characteristics such as effects of currents, tides and wind on horizontal transport and vertical mixing.
vii) Water characteristics, e.g. temperature, pH, salinity, stratification, oxygen indices of pollution - dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) - nitrogen present in organic and mineral form including ammonia, suspended matter, other nutrients and productivity.
viii) Existence and effects of other discharges which have been made in the discharge site, e.g. heavy metal background levels and organic carbon content.
c) Availability of Waste Technologies
The methods of waste reduction and discharge for industrial effluents as well as domestic sewage should be selected taking into account the availability and feasibility of:
i) Alternative treatment processes;
ii) Re-use or elimination methods;
iii) On-land disposal alternative; and
iv) Appropriate low-waste technologies.
d) General Considerations and Conditions
i) Possible effects on amenities, e.g. presence of floating or stranded materials, turbidity, objectionable odour. discoloration and foaming.
ii) Effects on human health through pollution impact on: Edible marine organisms; bathing waters; aesthetics; etc.
iii) Effects on marine ecosystems, in particular living resources, endangered species and critical habitats.
iv) Possible effects on other uses of the sea, e.g. impairment of water quality for industrial use, underwater corrosion of structure, interference with ship operations from floating materials, interference with fishing or navigation through deposit of waste or solid objects on the seafloor and protection of areas of special importance for scientific or conservation purposes.
