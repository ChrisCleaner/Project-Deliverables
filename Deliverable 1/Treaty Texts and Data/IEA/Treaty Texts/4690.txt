Signed at Washington November 6, 1897, Not submitted to the Senate, Unperfected Treaty Series X-4.
Note: The convention was signed by the United States, Japan, and Russia. See remarks by President William McKinley in his annual message to Congress of December 6, 1897 (2 State of the Union 1873). The adhesion of Great Britain was necessary for the convention to take effect (Article 2). Great Britain disapproved the convention, and it was replaced by one signed July 7, 1911 (37 Stat. 1542; TS 564; 1 Bevans 804) (Patterson). The original convention, in English, is in the treaty file, which also contains full powers dated October 29, 1897, given to U.S. delegates to the International Fur Seal Conference held at Washington October 23 to November 6, 1897 (Carroll). The present text is transcribed from the original in the treaty file. Selected references: Charles C.
