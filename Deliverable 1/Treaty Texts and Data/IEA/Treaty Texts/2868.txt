    ﻿Amendments To The Schedule To The International Convention For The Regulation Of Whaling Of 2 December 1946
Source: AUSTRALIAN TREATY SERIES 1977 No. 36 (electronic)
The amendments read as follows:
A. New layout for section III, Capture
The new layout adopted is shown in Appendix 1.
Some resulting necessary changes of wording are shown in italic type.
The existing paragraphs numbered 16 to 23 will be renumbered 18 to 25.
Consequential changes in paragraph 18(a) in the new numbering (paragraph 16(a) in the old numbering) result from the renumbering of some of the paragraphs referenced therein. These do not change the substance of the text, which now reads:
"18. (a) It is forbidden to use a factory ship or a land station for the purpose of treating any whales (whether or not taken by whale catchers under the jurisdiction of a Contracting Government) which are classified as Protection Stocks in paragraph 8 or are taken by whale catchers under the jurisdiction of a Contracting Government in contravention of paragraphs 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 14 and 15 of this Schedule."
B. Substantive amendments
(i) Paragraph 1
Amend the final definition of section I. Interpretation as follows:
" "Small-type whaling" means catching operations using powered vessels with mounted harpoon guns hunting exclusively for minke, bottlenose, beaked, pilot or killer whales.
"Bottlenose whale" means any whale known by the name Baird's beaked whale (Berardius bairdii), Arnoux's whale (Berardius arnuxii), Southern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon planifrons), or Northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus).
"Beaked whale" means any whale belonging to the genus Mesoplodon, or any whale known by the name of Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), or Shepherd's beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi).
"Pilot whale" means any whale known by the name of long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melaena) or short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus).
"Killer whale" means any whale known by the name of killer whale or orca (Orcinus orca)."
(ii) Paragraph 7, (new numbering)
Add new sub-paragraph (c), to define North Atlantic whale stock boundaries (shown in Appendix 1, in bold type).
(iii) Paragraph 11 (new numbering, old paragraph 7)
Delete the words "or right".
(iv) Paragraph 2(e), last sentence
Delete "eight" and substitute "nine", so that the sentence reads:
"Notwithstanding this paragraph one continuous open season not to exceed nine months may be implemented so far as Greenland is concerned."
(v) Section VI, information required.
Add the following new paragraph 26 before existing final paragraph, which is renumbered 27:
"26. (a) Where possible all factory ships and land stations shall collect from each whale taken:
(1) The combined weight of both testes, and tissue samples from one testis; or both ovaries
(2) At least one ear plug, or one tooth (preferably first mandibular).
(b) Where possible similar collections to those described in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph shall be undertaken by small-type whaling operations conducted from shore or by pelagic fleets.
(c) All specimens collected under sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) shall be properly labelled with the platform or other identification number of the whale and be appropriately preserved."
C. Miscellaneous provisions
(i) Paragraph 7 (new numbering, old paragraph 5)
Change "parallels of longitude" to "meridians of longitude" in two places (shown in Appendix 1, in italic).
Delete "40° South Latitude" and "except that for sei and Bryde's whales combined and minke whales they shall extend to".
First sentence then to read as shown in Appendix 1.
(ii) Paragraph 8(a) (new numbering, old paragraph 6(a))
Second sentence, insert "a" before Sustained Management Stock (shown in Appendix 1, in italic).
(iii) Paragraph 13(a) (new numbering, old paragraph 15(a))
Insert "in length" after 40 feet (12.2 metres).
Delete "in length" after 35 feet (10.7 metres) (shown in Appendix 1, in italic).
(iv) Paragraph 24(a) (new numbering, old paragraph 22(a))
Line 3, delete "fin".

CLASSIFICATION OF STOCKS
8. All stocks of whales shall be classified in one of three categories according to the advice of the Scientific Committee as follows:
(a) A Sustained Management Stock (SMS) is a stock which is not more than 10 per cent of Maximum Sustainable Yield (hereinafter referred to as MSY) stock level below MSY stock level, and not more than 20 per cent above that level, MSY being determined on the basis of the number of whales.
When a stock has remained at a stable level for a considerable period under a regime of approximately constant catches, it shall be classified as a Sustained Management Stock in the absence of any positive evidence that it should be otherwise classified.
Commercial whaling shall be permitted on Sustained Management Stocks according to the advice of the Scientific Committee. These stocks are listed in Tables 1 and 2 of this Schedule.
For the 1977/78 pelagic season and the 1978 coastal season in the Southern Hemisphere and for the 1977 season in all other areas for stocks between the MSY stock level and 10 per cent below that level, the permitted catch shall not exceed the number of whales obtained by taking 90 per cent of the MSY and reducing that number by 10 per cent for every 1 per cent by which the stock falls short of the MSY stock level. For stocks at or above the MSY stock level, the permitted catch shall not exceed 90 per cent of the MSY.
(b) An Initial Management Stock (IMS) is a stock more than 20 per cent of MSY stock level above MSY stock level. Commercial whaling shall be permitted on Initial Management Stocks according to the advice of the Scientific Committee as to measures necessary to bring the stocks to the MSY stock level and then optimum level in an efficient manner and without risk of reducing them below this level. The permitted catch for such stocks will not be more than 90 per cent of MSY as far as this is known, or, where it will be more appropriate, catching effort shall be limited to that which will take 90 per cent of MSY in a stock at MSY stock level.
In the absence of any positive evidence that a continuing higher percentage will not reduce the stock below the MSY stock level no more than 5 per cent of the estimated initial exploitable stock shall be taken in any one year. Exploitation should not commence until an estimate of stock size has been obtained which is satisfactory in the view of the Scientific Committee. Stocks classified as Initial Management Stock are listed in Tables 1 and 2 of this Schedule.
(c) A Protection Stock (PS) is a stock which is below 10 per cent of MSY stock level below MSY stock level.
There shall be no commercial whaling on species or stocks whilst they are classified as Protection Stocks. Species and stocks so classified are listed in Tables 1 and 2 of this Schedule.
AREAS, REGIONS, DIVISIONS, STOCK CLASSIFICATIONS AND QUOTAS
BALEEN WHALES; CATCH LIMITS
9. The number of baleen whales taken during the open season in the Southern Hemisphere by factory ships, land stations or whale catchers attached thereto under the jurisdiction of the Contracting Governments shall not exceed 771 sei whales and 5,690 minke whales and 0 Bryde's whales (pending a satisfactory estimate of stock size), in the 1977/78 pelagic season and the 1978 coastal season. The total catches taken in any of the Areas I to VI shall not exceed the limits shown in Table 1. However, in no circumstances shall the sum of the Area catches exceed the total quotas for each species.

SIZE LIMITS
13. (a) It is forbidden to take or kill any sei or Bryde's whales below 40 feet (12.2 metres) in length except that sei and Bryde's whales of not less than 35 feet (10.7 metres) may be taken for delivery to land stations, provided that, the meat of such whales is to be used for local consumption as human or animal food.
(b) It is forbidden to take or kill any fin whales below 57 feet (17.4 metres) in length in the Southern Hemisphere, and it is forbidden to take or kill fin whales below 55 feet (16.8 metres) in the Northern Hemisphere; except that fin whales of not less than 55 feet (16.8 metres) may be taken for delivery to land stations in the Southern Hemisphere and fin whales of not less than 50 feet (15.2 metres) may be taken for delivery to land stations in the Northern Hemisphere, provided that, in each case the meat of such whales is to be used for local consumption as human or animal food.

FURTHER CONSEQUENTIAL CHANGES
[as indicated by Japan]
In paragraph 23(a)(3) in the new numbering (paragraph 21(a)(3) in the old numbering), "sub-paragraph 17(b)" should be "sub-paragraph 19(b)".
In paragraph 23(b)(2) in the new numbering (paragraph 21(b)(2) in the old numbering), "paragraph 20" should be "paragraph 22".
In paragraph 24(b) in the new numbering (paragraph 22(b) in the old numbering), "paragraph 11" should be "paragraph 9".
Sub-paragraph 4 of paragraph 8(a) of the re-numbered Schedule (paragraph 6(a) in the old numbering) reads:
"For the 1977/78 pelagic season and the 1978 coastal season in the Southern Hemisphere and for the 1978 season in all other areas for stocks between the MSY stock level and 10 per cent below that level ...".
[as indicated by the Secretariat]
In paragraph 1 (new and old numbering) the second set of inverted commas has been removed from the definition of "Bryde's whale".
In paragraph 3(e) (new and old numbering) "paragraph 10" should be "paragraph 6".
In paragraph 4 (new and old numbering) "paragraph 12" should be "paragraphs 10 and 15" and "this paragraph" should be "these paragraphs" so that the second part of paragraph 4 reads:
"... provided that catch limits in the North Pacific Ocean and dependent waters are established as provided in paragraphs 10 and 15 of this Schedule and provided that these paragraphs shall not apply to a ship which has been used during the season solely for freezing or salting the meat and entrails of whales intended for human food or feeding animals."
In paragraph 7(c) in the new numbering "Minke whale stock" should read "Minke whale stocks" and similarly "Sei whale stock" should read "Sei whale stocks".
