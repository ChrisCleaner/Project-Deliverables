DESIRING to strengthen further international co-operation in the safe development and use of nuclear energy,
CONVINCED of the need for States to provide relevant information about nuclear accidents as early as possible in order that transboundary radiological consequences can be minimized,
NOTING the usefulness of bilateral and multilateral arrangements on information exchange in this area,
HAVE AGREED as follows:

2. The facilities and activities referred to in paragraph 1 are the following:
a. any nuclear reactor wherever located;
b. any nuclear fuel cycle facility;
c. any radioactive waste management facility;
d. the transport and storage of nuclear fuels or radioactive wastes;
e. the manufacture, use, storage, disposal and transport of radioisotopes for agricultural, industrial, medical and related scientific and research purposes; and
f. the use of radioisotopes for power generation in space objects.
Article 2
Notification and information
In the event of an accident specified in article 1 (hereinafter referred to as a "nuclear accident"), the State Party referred to in that article shall:

a. the time, exact location where appropriate, and the nature of the nuclear accident;
b. the facility or activity involved;
c. the assumed or established cause and the foreseeable development of the nuclear accident relevant to the transboundary release of the radioactive materials;
d. the general characteristics of the radioactive release, including, as far as is practicable and appropriate, the nature, probable physical and chemical form and the quantity, composition and effective height of the radioactive release;
e. information on current and forecast meteorological and hydrological conditions, necessary for forecasting the transboundary release of the radioactive materials;
f. the results of environmental monitoring relevant to the transboundary release of the radioactive materials;
g. the off-site protective measures taken or planned;
h. the predicted behaviour over time of the radioactive release.
2. Such information shall be supplemented at appropriate intervals by further relevant information on the development of the emergency situation, including its foreseeable or actual termination.
