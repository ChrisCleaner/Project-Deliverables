Footnotes to products in chapter 17
Some entries in chapter 17 contain footnotes, as either letters or symbols in parentheses
following the name of the product, in column a of the tables. These provide additional
information about the carriage requirements for the product. The definitions of these footnotes
are included below.
a If the product to be carried contains flammable solvents such that the flashpoint does not
exceed 60°C, then special electrical systems and a flammable-vapour detector shall be
provided.
b Although water is suitable for extinguishing open-air fires involving chemicals to which
this footnote applies, water shall not be allowed to contaminate closed tanks containing
these chemicals because of the risk of hazardous gas generation.
c Phosphorus, yellow or white, is carried above its autoignition temperature and therefore
flashpoint is not appropriate. Electrical equipment requirements may be similar to those
for substances with a flashpoint above 60°C.
d Requirements are based on those isomers having a flashpoint of 60°C or less; some
isomers have a flashpoint greater than 60°C and therefore the requirements based on
flammability would not apply to such isomers.
e Applies to n-decyl alcohol only.
f Dry chemical shall not be used as fire-extinguishing media.
g Confined spaces shall be tested for both formic acid vapours and carbon monoxide gas,
a decomposition product.
h Applies to p-xylene only.
i For mixtures containing no other components with safety hazards and where the
pollution category is Y or less.
j Only certain alcohol-resistant foams are effective.
k Requirements for Ship Type identified in column e might be subject to regulation 4.1.3
of Annex II of MARPOL.
l Applicable when the melting point is equal to or greater than 0C.
m From vegetable oils, animal fats and fish oils specified in the IBC Code.
n Confirmation that the product is composed of Triglycerides, C16-C18 and C18
unsaturated shall be required in order for the entry to be used. Otherwise, the more
generic entry "Used cooking oil (m)" must be used.
o Indicates that the entries are to be used solely for backloading of contaminated bulk
liquids from offshore installations used in the search and exploitation of seabed mineral
resources.
* Indicates that with reference to chapter 21 of the IBC Code (paragraph 21.1.3),
deviations from the normal assignment criteria used for some carriage requirements
have been implemented.
Chapter 18
List of products to which the Code does not apply
18.1 The following are products which have been reviewed for their safety and pollution
hazards and determined not to present hazards to such an extent as to warrant application of
the Code.
18.2 Although the products listed in this chapter fall outside the scope of the Code, the
attention of Administrations is drawn to the fact that some safety precautions may be needed
for their safe transportation. Accordingly, Administrations shall prescribe appropriate safety
requirements.
18.3 Some liquid substances are identified as falling into Pollution Category Z and,
therefore, subject to certain requirements of MARPOL Annex II.
18.4 Liquid mixtures which are assessed or provisionally assessed under regulation 6.3 of
MARPOL Annex II as falling into Pollution Category Z or OS, and which do not present safety
hazards, may be carried under the appropriate entry in this chapter for "Noxious or
Non-Noxious Liquid Substances, not otherwise specified (n.o.s.)".
EXPLANATORY NOTES

Chapter 19
Index of Products Carried in Bulk
19.1 The first column of the Index of Products Carried in Bulk (hereafter referred to as
"the Index") provides the so-called Index Name. Where the Index Name is in capitals and in
bold, the Index Name is identical to the Product Name in either chapter 17 or chapter 18.
The second column listing the relevant Product Name is therefore empty. Where the Index
Name is non-bold lower case it reflects a synonym for which the Product Name in either
chapter 17 or chapter 18 is given in the second column. The relevant chapter of the IBC Code
is reflected in the third column.
19.2 Following a review of chapter 19, a column listing UN numbers which was previously
included had been removed from the Index. Since UN numbers are only available for a limited
number of Index Names and there are inconsistencies between some of the names used in
chapter 19 and those linked to UN numbers, it was decided to remove UN number references
in order to avoid any confusion.
19.3 The Index has been developed for information purposes only. None of the Index
Names indicated in non-bold lower case in the first column shall be used as the Product Name
on the shipping document.
19.4 Prefixes forming an integral part of the name are shown in ordinary (roman) type and
are taken into account in determining the alphabetical order of entries. These include such
prefixes as:
Mono Di Tri Tetra Penta Iso Bis Neo Ortho Cyclo
19.5 Prefixes that are disregarded for purposes of alphabetical order are the following:
n- (normal-)
sec- (secondary-)
tert- (tertiary-)
o- (ortho-)
m- (meta-)
p- (para-)
NOSsym- (symmetrical)
uns- (unsymmetrical)
dlDLcistrans-
(E)-
(Z)-
alpha- (α-)
beta- (β-)
gamma- (γ-)
epsilon- (ε-)
omega- (ω-)
19.6 The Index utilizes a note after the Index Name for some entries (shown as (a) or (b))
which indicates that the following qualifications apply:
(a) this Index Name represents a subset of the corresponding Product Name.
(b) The Product Name corresponding to this Index Name contains a carbon
chain length qualification. Since the Index Name should always represent a
subset or be an exact synonym of the corresponding Product Name, the
carbon chain length characteristics should be checked for any product
identified by this Index Name.

Criteria for assigning carriage requirements for products subject to the IBC Code
21.1 Introduction
21.1.1 The following criteria are used for the determination of pollution classification and
assignment of appropriate carriage requirements for bulk liquid cargoes being assessed for
entry into the IBC Code or lists 1, 3 or 4 of the MEPC.2/Circular.
21.1.2 In developing such criteria, every effort has been made to follow the criteria and
cut-off points developed under the Globally Harmonized System (GHS).
21.1.3 Although the criteria are intended to be closely defined in order to establish a uniform
approach, it must be emphasized that where human experience or other factors indicate the
need for alternative arrangements, these shall always be taken into account. Where
deviations from the criteria have been recognized, they shall be properly recorded with
justifications.
21.2 Contents
21.2.1 This chapter contains the following:
.1 minimum safety and pollution criteria for products subject to chapter 17 of
the IBC Code;
.2 criteria used to assign the minimum carriage requirements for products that
meet the safety or pollution criteria to make them subject to chapter 17 of
the IBC Code;
.3 criteria used for determining special requirements in chapter 15 of the
IBC Code to be included in column o of chapter 17 of the IBC Code;
.4 criteria used for determining special requirements in chapter 16 of the
IBC Code to be included in column o of chapter 17 of the IBC Code;
.5 definitions of properties used within this chapter;
.6 information on the use of the GESAMP Hazard Ratings; and
.7 information on the application of the SVC/LC50 ratio method.
21.2.2 The information included in parentheses following the classification criteria
throughout this chapter refers to the GESAMP Hazard Profile ratings set out in appendix I of
MARPOL Annex II under the "Abbreviated legend to the revised GESAMP Hazard Evaluation
procedure". The full listing of GESAMP Hazard Profile ratings for evaluated substances are
published annually in the GESAMP Composite List as a PPR Circular. It should be noted that
ratings in parentheses (based on estimation methods applied by GESAMP) are considered
as equivalent to ratings without parentheses for the purpose of assigning carriage
requirements.
21.3 Minimum safety and pollution criteria for products subject to chapter 17 of the
IBC Code

21.7.2 Toxic to mammals by prolonged exposure
21.7.2.1 A product is classified as toxic to mammals by prolonged exposure if it meets any of
the following criteria: it is known to be, or suspected of being carcinogenic, mutagenic,
reprotoxic, neurotoxic, immunotoxic or exposure below the lethal dose is known to cause
Specific Target Organ Toxicity.
21.7.2.2 Such effects may be identified from the GESAMP Hazard Profile of the product
(D3 = C, M, R, T, N, or I) or other recognized sources of such information.
21.7.3 Skin sensitization
21.7.3.1 A product is classified as a skin sensitizer:
.1 if there is evidence in humans that the substance can induce sensitization by
skin contact in a substantial number of persons; or
.2 where there are positive results from an appropriate test.
21.7.3.2 Such effects are identified in the GESAMP Hazard Profile for the product (D3 = Ss).
21.7.4 Respiratory sensitization
21.7.4.1 A product is classified as a respiratory sensitizer:
.1 if there is evidence in humans that the substance can induce specific
respiratory hypersensitivity; and/or
.2 where there are positive results from an appropriate test; and/or
.3 where the product does not have a GESAMP Hazard Profile and is identified
as a skin sensitizer and there is no evidence to show that it is not a respiratory
sensitizer.
21.7.4.2 Such effects are identified in the GESAMP Hazard Profile for the product (D3 = Sr) or
other recognized sources of such information, if no profile exists.

Note: A rating of 3 or (3) in the D1 column of the GESAMP Hazard Profile without any
additional letter notation (A, B or C), means that the severity of corrosivity has not
been established. For such cases, a rating of 3 or (3) is understood to be equivalent
to a rating of 3B for the purpose of assigning carriage requirements.
3 Products that are corrosive to skin are also deemed to be corrosive by inhalation.
21.7.6 Water reactive substances
21.7.6.1 These are classified as follows:
Water Reactive
Index (WRI) Definition
3
Any chemical which is extremely reactive with water and
produces large quantities of flammable, toxic or corrosive gas
or aerosol
2
Any chemical which, in contact with water, may produce a
toxic, flammable or corrosive gas or aerosol
1
Any chemical which, in contact with water, may generate heat
or produce a non-toxic, non-flammable or non-corrosive gas
0
Any chemical which, in contact with water, would not undergo
a reaction to justify a value of 1, 2 or 3
21.7.7 Air reactive substances
21.7.7.1 Air reactive substances are products that react with air to cause a potentially
hazardous situation, e.g. the formation of peroxides that may cause an explosive reaction.
21.7.8 Electrical apparatus – Temperature class
(for products which either have a flashpoint of ≤ 60oC or are heated to within 15°C of
their flashpoint)
21.7.8.1 The temperature class is defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) as:
"The highest temperature attained under practical conditions of operation within the
rating of the apparatus (and recognized overloads, if any, associated therewith) by
any part of any surface, the exposure of which to an explosive atmosphere may
involve a risk."
21.7.8.2 The temperature class of the electrical apparatus is assigned by selecting the
Maximum Surface Temperature which is closest to, but less than, the product's auto-ignition
temperature (see 21.4.9.1.1).
21.7.9 Electrical apparatus – Apparatus group
(for products with a flashpoint of ≤ 60oC)
21.7.9.1 This refers to intrinsically safe and associated electrical apparatus for explosive gas
atmospheres which the IEC divide into the following groups:
Group I: for mines susceptible to firedamp (not used by IMO); and
Group II: for applications in other industries – further subdivided according to its
Maximum Experimental Safe Gap (MESG) and/or the Minimum Igniting
Current (MIC) of the gas/vapour into groups IIA, IIB and IIC.
21.7.9.2 This property cannot be determined from other data associated with the product; it
has to be either measured or assigned by assimilation with related products in a homologous
series.
21.7.10 Special carriage control conditions
21.7.10.1 Special carriage control conditions refer to specific measures that need to be taken
in order to prevent a hazardous reaction. They include:
.1 Inhibition: the addition of a compound (usually organic) that retards or stops
an undesired chemical reaction such as corrosion, oxidation or
polymerization;
.2 Stabilization: the addition of a substance (stabilizer) that tends to keep a
compound, mixture or solution from changing its form or chemical nature.
Such stabilizers may retard a reaction rate, preserve a chemical equilibrium,
act as antioxidants, keep pigments and other components in emulsion form
or prevent the particles in colloidal suspension from precipitating;
.3 Inertion: the addition of a gas (usually nitrogen) in the ullage space of a tank
that prevents the formation of a flammable cargo/air mixture;
.4 Temperature control: the maintenance of a specific temperature range for
the cargo in order to prevent a hazardous reaction or to keep the viscosity
low enough to allow the product to be pumped; and
.5 Padding and venting: only applies to specific products identified on a case
by case basis.
21.7.11 Flammable cargoes
21.7.11.1 A cargo is defined as flammable according to the following criteria:
IBC Code descriptor Flashpoint (degrees Centigrade)
Highly flammable &lt; 23
Flammable ≤ 60 but ≥ 23
21.7.11.2 It should be noted that flashpoints of mixtures and aqueous solutions need to be
measured unless all of the components are non-flammable.
21.7.11.3 It should be noted that the carriage of bulk liquid cargoes that have a flashpoint
of ≤ 60°C are subject to other SOLAS regulations.
21.7.12 Application of the SVC/LC50 ratio method
21.7.12.1 If the vapour pressure and the molecular weight of a substance are known, an
estimate of the maximum vapour concentration in a closed compartment (e.g. a tank) can be
calculated. This is called the Saturated Vapour Concentration (SVC).
21.7.12.2 The hazard quotient SVC/LC504
is a substance specific value for the velocity of a
vapour for achieving a hazardous concentration when emerging from a liquid source (e.g. leak,
spillage or tank ventilation), and can be used in the assignment of specific carriage
requirements related to inhalation toxicity.
21.7.12.3 If a solid substance is transported in an aqueous solution, the vapour pressure5 of
this solid rather than that of water may be used in the calculation of the SVC/LC50 ratio.
21.7.12.4 Application of the SVC/LC50 ratio for assigning Ship Type and Tank type
21.7.12.4.1 For the assignment of Ship Type and tank type, as set out in paragraph 21.4.5
and 21.4.6, the application of the SVC/LC50 ratio method is optional. Should this method be
used, the vapour pressure at 20°C shall be used when calculating the SVC/LC50 ratio.
21.7.12.4.2 The SVC mg/L of a substance should be calculated as follows:

21.7.12.5 Application of the SVC/LC50 ratio for assigning carriage requirements
21.7.12.5.1 For the carriage requirements listed in 21.7.12.5.5, the application of the
SVC/LC50 ratio method is optional. If the SVC/LC50 ratio method is used in the assignment of
these carriage requirements, the vapour pressure at 40°C shall be used when calculating the
SVC/LC50 ratio. If the carriage temperature is higher than 40°C, then the SVC/LC50 ratio should
be calculated at that temperature.
21.7.12.5.2 The SVC (mg/l) of a substance should be calculated as follows:
where MW is the molecular weight of the substance.

If this data is not available, an estimate may be used.
21.7.12.5.4 The SVC (mg/L) formula described in 21.7.12.5.2 is standardized for
calculations at 40°C. When using the vapour pressure at higher temperatures in the
calculations, the formula must be amended accordingly.
21.7.12.5.5 For the following carriage requirements, the SVC/LC50 ratio method, calculated
at 40°C or higher, may be used as an alternative to the acute inhalation toxicity criteria given
in paragraphs 21.4 and 21.5:
.1 Column g – Tank vents
Assignment of controlled venting is not required based on the
inhalation hazard only, if:
Inhalation LC50/ATE ≤ 10 mg/L/4h (C3 = 2, 3, or 4) and SVC/LC50 &lt; 0.2
.2 Column j – Gauging
Closed gauging is not required based on the inhalation hazard only, if:
Inhalation LC50/ATE ≤ 2 mg/L/4h (C3 = 3 or 4) and SVC/LC50 &lt; 0.2 but
restricted gauging is required.
Restricted gauging is not required based on the inhalation hazard only,
if:
Inhalation LC50/ATE &gt; 2 - ≤ 10 mg/L/4h (C3 = 2) and SVC/LC50 &lt; 0.2
