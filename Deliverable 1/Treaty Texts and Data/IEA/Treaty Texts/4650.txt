 ARTICLE 14
 Legal Status, Privileges and Immunities
 1. INFOFISH shall possess juridical personality and such legal capacity as may be necessary for the fulfilment of the Organization's objectives and for the exercise of its functions.
 2. The representatives of Member States and the Director and staff of INFOFISH shall be accorded the privileges and immunities necessary for the independent exercise of their functions with the Organization.
 3. Each Member State shall accord the status, privileges and immunities referred to above in the following manner:
 (a) In the territory of each Member State which has acceded to the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies in respect of FAO, those which are stipulated therein, mutatis mutandis;
 (b) In the territory of each Member State which has not acceded to the above Convention in respect of FAO but which has acceded to the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, those which are stipulated therein, mutatis mutandis, unless that Member State notifies the DirectorGeneral of FAO at the time of the deposit of its instrument of ratification or accession that it will not apply the said Convention in which case that Member shall, within six months thereafter, conclude an agreement with INFOFISH granting a status and privileges and immunities comparable to those provided for in the said Convention;
 (c) If a Member has not acceded to either of the above Conventions it shall, within six months of the deposit of its instrument of ratification or accession, conclude an agreement with INFOFISH granting a status and privileges and immunities comparable to those provided for in the said Conventions.
 4. Privileges and immunities are accorded to the representatives of Member States and the Director and staff of INFOFISH not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves, but in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organization. Consequently, a Member or the Director, as the case may be, not only has the right but is under a duty to waive the immunity of its representatives or of a staff member in any case where, in the opinion of the Member or of the Director, the immunity would impede the course of justice, and where it can be waived without prejudice to the purpose for which the immunity is accorded. If the Member sending the representative or the Director, as the case may be, does not waive the immunity of the representative or the staff member, the Member or the Director shall make the strongest efforts to achieve an equitable solution of the matter.
 5. INFOFISH shall conclude a headquarters agreement with the Host State, and may conclude agreements with other States in which offices of the Organization may be located, specifying the privileges and immunities and facilities to be enjoyed by the Organization to enable it to fulfil its objectives and to perform its functions.

 2.
