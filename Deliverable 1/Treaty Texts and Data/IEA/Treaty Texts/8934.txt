8. Decide on the status of the organosilicon compounds in the LBS protocol as follows:
Status of organosilicon compounds in the Protocol for the protection of the Mediterranean Sea against pollution from Land-based Sources
The Contracting Parties: [1]
- Considering recent scientific evidence regarding the toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation of organosilicon compounds, and their status as actual or potential marine pollutants;
- Further considering that any future control measures becoming necessary can be adequately covered by annex I, item 7; annex II, item 10 and annex II, item 13 to the above-mentioned Protocol;
- Agree to amend annex II to the Protocol for the protection of the Mediterranean Sea against pollution from Land-based Sources by deleting item 3 thereof - "Organosilicon compounds and substances which may form such compounds in the marine environment, excluding those which are biologically harmless or are rapidly converted into biologically harmless substances".
