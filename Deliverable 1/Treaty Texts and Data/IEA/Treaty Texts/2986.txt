The Contracting Parties to the present Protocol,
Being Parties to the Convention for the Protection, Management and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Eastern African Region, done at Nairobi on 21 June 1985,
Conscious of the danger from increasing human activities which is threatening the environment of the Eastern African region,
Recognizing that natural resources constitute a heritage of scientific, cultural, educational, recreational and economic value that needs to be effectively protected,
Stressing the importance of protecting and, as appropriate, improving the state of the wild fauna and flora and natural habitats of the Eastern African region among other means by the establishment of specially protected areas in the marine and coastal environment,
Desirous of establishing close co-operation among themselves in order to achieve that objective,
Have agreed as follows:
Article 1 DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of this Protocol:

Article 2 GENERAL UNDERTAKING
1. The Contracting Parties shall take all appropriate measures to maintain essential ecological processes and life support systems, to preserve genetic diversity, and to ensure the sustainable utilization of harvested natural resources under their jurisdiction. In particular, the Contracting Parties shall endeavour to protect and preserve rare or fragile ecosystems as well as rare, depleted, threatened or endangered species of wild fauna and flora and their habitats in the Eastern African region.
2. To this end, the Contracting Parties shall develop national conservation strategies and co-ordinate, if appropriate, such strategies within the framework of regional conservation activities.
Article 3 PROTECTION OF WILD FLORA
The Contracting Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure the protection of the wild flora species specified in annex I. To this end, each Contracting Party shall, as appropriate, prohibit activities having adverse effects on the habitats of such species, as well as the uncontrolled picking, collecting, cutting or uprooting of such species. Each Contracting Party shall, as appropriate, prohibit the possession or sale of such species.
Article 4 SPECIES OF WILD FAUNA REQUIRING SPECIAL PROTECTION
The Contracting Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure the strictest protection of the endangered wild fauna species listed in annex II. To this end, each Contracting Party shall strictly regulate and, where required, prohibit activities having adverse effects on the habitats of such species.

(a) natural habitats, and in particular as critical habitats, for species of fauna and flora, especially those which are rare, threatened or endemic;
(b) migration routes or as wintering, staging, feeding or moulting sites for migratory species;
(c) areas necessary for the maintenance of stocks of economically important marine species;
(d) reserves of genetic resources;
(e) rare or fragile ecosystems;

Article 12 TRADITIONAL ACTIVITIES
1. The Contracting Parties shall, in promulgating protective measures, take into account the traditional activities of their local populations in the areas to be protected. To the fullest extent possible, no exemption which is allowed for this reason shall be such as:
(a) to endanger either the maintenance of ecosystems protected under the terms of the present Protocol or the biological processes contributing to the maintenance of those ecosystems;
(b) to cause either the extinction of, or any substantial reduction in, the number of individuals making up the species of animal and plant populations within the protected ecosystems, or any ecologically connected species or populations, particularly migratory, endemic, rare, depleted, threatened or endangered species.

Article 13 FRONTIER PROTECTED AREAS
1. If a Contracting Party intends to establish a protected area contiguous to the frontier or to the limits of the zone of national jurisdiction of another Contracting Party, the two Contracting Parties shall, as necessary, consult each other with a view to reaching agreement on the measures to be taken and shall, among other things, examine the possibility of the establishment by the other Party of a corresponding protected area or buffer area.
2. If a Contracting Party intends to establish a protected area contiguous to the frontier or to the limits of the zone of national jurisdiction of a State which is not a party to this Protocol, the Party shall endeavour to work together with that State with a view to holding consultations as referred to in the preceding paragraph.
3. If a State which is not a party to this Protocol intends to establish a protected area contiguous to the frontier or to the limits of the zone of national jurisdiction of a Contracting Party to this Protocol, the latter shall endeavour to work together with that State with a view to holding consultations.
Article 14 PUBLICITY AND NOTIFICATION
The Contracting Parties shall give appropriate publicity to the establishment of protected areas, in particular to their boundaries and the regulations applying thereto. Such information shall be transmitted to the Organization which shall compile and maintain a current directory of protected areas in the Eastern African region.

Such information should have an appropriate place in education programmes concerning the environment, archaeology and history. The Contracting Parties should also endeavour to promote the participation of their public and their nature conservation organizations in the protection of the areas and wild fauna and flora concerned.
Article 16 REGIONAL CO-OPERATION
The Contracting Parties shall establish a regional programme to co-ordinate the selection, establishment, and management of protected areas and the protection of wild fauna and flora with a view to creating a representative network of protected areas in the Eastern African region.
