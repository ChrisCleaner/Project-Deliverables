Decision 2014/2: Amending annex I to the Convention
The Conference of the Parties,
Recognizing the need to update the categories of substances and mixtures and the named substances and their threshold quantities, as contained in annex I to the Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents, for the purposes of introducing the criteria of the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (ST/SG/AC.10/30/Rev.4) and of maintaining consistency with the corresponding European Union legislation,
Bearing in mind its decision to undertake a revision of the hazardous substances and their quantities as contained in annex I, and its decision 2004/4 on establishing the Working Group on the Development of the Convention,
Acknowledging the proposal to amend annex I, drawn up by the Working Group on the basis of a thorough review,
Amends annex I to the Convention on hazardous substances for the purposes of defining hazardous activities by replacing it with the text set out in the annex to this decision.
Annex [Ed note: reformatted to present in plain text -- tabs replaced by ........]

Notes
1 Criteria according the United Nations Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (ST/SG/AC.10/30/Rev.4). Parties should use these criteria when classifying substances or mixtures for the purposes of Part I of this annex, unless other legally binding criteria have been adopted in the national legislation. Mixtures shall be treated in the same way as the pure substance, provided they remain within concentration limits set according to their properties in accordance with the GHS unless a percentage composition or other description is specifically given.
2 According to the criteria in chapters 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 of GHS.
3 According to the criteria in chapters 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 of GHS.
4 Substances that fall within acute toxic Category 3 via the oral route shall fall under entry 2 acute toxic in those cases where neither acute inhalation toxicity classification nor acute dermal toxicity classification can be derived, for example due to lack of conclusive inhalation and dermal toxicity data.
5 Substances that have produced significant toxicity in humans, or that, on the basis of evidence from studies in experimental animals can be presumed to have the potential to produce significant toxicity in humans following single exposure. Further guidance is given in figure 3.8.1. and table 3.8.1 of part 3 of GHS.
6 Testing for explosive properties of substances and mixtures is only necessary if the screening procedure according to appendix 6, part 3, of the Manual of Tests and Criteria identifies the substance or mixture as potentially having explosive properties.
7 The hazard class Explosives includes explosive articles. If the quantity of the explosive substance or mixture contained in the article is known, that quantity shall be considered for the purposes of this Convention. If the quantity of the explosive substance or mixture contained in the article is not known, then, for the purposes of this Convention, the whole article shall be treated as explosive.
8 If Explosives of division 1.4 are unpacked or repacked, they shall be assigned to the entry 4 (Explosive), unless the hazard is shown to still correspond to division 1.4, in accordance with GHS.
9 According to the criteria in chapter 2.2.2 of GHS.
10 Aerosols are classified according to the criteria in chapter 2.3 of GHS and the Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part III, section 31 referred to therein.
11 In order to use this entry, it must be documented that the aerosol dispenser does not contain flammable gas Category 1 or 2 nor flammable liquid Category 1.
12 According to the criteria in chapter 2.4.2 of GHS.
13 According to the criteria in chapter 2.6.2 of GHS.
14 Liquids with a flash point of more than 35°C may be regarded as non-flammable liquids for some regulatory purposes (e.g., transport) if negative results have been obtained in sustained combustibility test L.2, in part III, section 32 of the Manual of Tests and Criteria. This is, however, not valid under elevated conditions such as high temperature or pressure, and therefore such liquids are included in this entry.
15 According to the criteria in chapter 2.6.2 of GHS.
16 According to the criteria in chapter 2.6.2 of GHS.
17 According to the criteria in chapters 2.8.2 and 2.15.2.2 of GHS.
18 According to the criteria in chapters 2.8.2 and 2.15.2.2 of GHS.
19 According to the criteria in chapter 4.1.2 of GHS.
20 According to the criteria in chapter 4.1.2 of GHS.
21 According to the criteria in chapter 2.12.2 of GHS.
22 Ammonium nitrate (10,000): fertilizers capable of self-sustaining decomposition.
This applies to ammonium nitrate–based compound/composite fertilizers (compound/composite fertilizers containing ammonium nitrate with phosphate and/or potash), which are capable of self- sustaining decomposition according to the Trough Test (see Manual of Tests and Criteria, part III, subsection 38.2), and in which the nitrogen content as a result of ammonium nitrate is:
(a) Between 15.75% and 24.5% by weight (15.75% and 24.5% nitrogen content by weight as a result of ammonium nitrate correspond to 45% and 70% ammonium nitrate, respectively) and which either contain not more than 0.4% total combustible/organic materials or fulfil the requirements of an appropriate test of resistance to detonation (e.g., 4-inch-steel-tube test);
(b) 15.75% by weight or less and unrestricted combustible materials.
23 Ammonium nitrate (5,000): fertilizer grade.
This applies to straight ammonium nitrate-based fertilizers and to ammonium nitrate-based compound/composite fertilizers in which the nitrogen content as a result of ammonium nitrate is:
(a) More than 24.5% by weight, except for mixtures of straight ammonium nitrate-based fertilizers with dolomite, limestone and/or calcium carbonate with a purity of at least 90%;
(b) More than 15.75% by weight for mixtures of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate;
(c) More than 28% (28% nitrogen content by weight as a result of ammonium nitrate corresponds to 80% ammonium nitrate) by weight for mixtures of straight ammonium nitrate-based fertilizers with dolomite, limestone and/or calcium carbonate with a purity of at least 90%; and which fulfil the requirements of an appropriate test of resistance to detonation (e.g., 4-inch-steel- tube test).
24 Ammonium nitrate (2,500): technical grade.
This applies to:
(a) Ammonium nitrate and mixtures of ammonium nitrate in which the nitrogen content as a result of ammonium nitrate is:
(i) Between 24.5% and 28% by weight and which contain not more than 0.4% combustible substances;
(ii) More than 28% by weight, and which contain not more than 0.2% combustible substances;
(b) Aqueous ammonium nitrate solutions in which the concentration of ammonium nitrate is more than 80% by weight.
25 Ammonium nitrate (50): “off-specs” material and fertilizers not fulfilling the requirements of an appropriate test of resistance to detonation (e.g., 4-inch-steel-tube test). This applies to:
(a) Material rejected during the manufacturing process and to ammonium nitrate and mixtures of ammonium nitrate, straight ammonium nitrate-based fertilizers and ammonium nitrate-based compound/composite fertilizers referred to in notes 23 and 24 that are being or have been returned from the final user to a manufacturer, temporary storage or reprocessing plant for reworking, recycling or treatment for safe use because they no longer comply with the specifications in notes 23 and 24;
(b) Fertilizers referred to in note 22 (a) and note 23 which do not fulfil the requirements of an appropriate test of resistance to detonation (e.g., 4-inch-steel-tube test).
26 Potassium nitrate (10,000): composite potassium nitrate-based fertilizers (in prilled/granular form) which have the same properties as pure potassium nitrate.
27 Potassium nitrate (5,000): composite potassium nitrate-based fertilizers (in crystalline form) which have the same hazardous properties as pure potassium nitrate.
28 Upgraded biogas: for the purpose of the implementation of the Convention, upgraded biogas may be classified under entry 14 of Part 2 of annex I where it has been processed in accordance with applicable standards for purified and upgraded biogas ensuring a quality equivalent to that of natural gas, including the content of methane, and which has a maximum of 1% oxygen.
