Noting the uniqueness of the Caspian Sea environment, its considerable natural resources and economic potential, the rational use of which is of extreme importance for sustainable development of the States of the Parties;
Taking into consideration the specific hydrometeorological conditions of the Caspian Sea resulting from its periodic level fluctuations, as well as increased economic activities in its basin, which require additional efforts from the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (hereinafter NMHS) of the Parties to meet the growing demand for hydrometeorological support of these activities;
Expressing concern about global and regional aspects of possible climate change that may produce a detrimental effect on the hydrometeorological regime of the Caspian Sea;
Noting the significance of the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea (Tehran Convention) as a mechanism for regional cooperation among the States of the Parties;
Emphasizing the need to establish and develop a regional system for obtaining and exchanging hydrometeorological information on the state of the Caspian Sea to facilitate solving ecological, economic and social problems in the region;
Expressing determination to unite efforts and organize a close cooperation of the Parties in the field of hydrometeorology of the Caspian Sea;
Considering the experience of international cooperation in the field of hydrometeorology obtained in other aquatic areas, including cooperation facilitated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO,
Have agreed on the following:
Article 1
For the purposes of the present Agreement, the following terms shall be used:
"State of the Caspian Sea" - a set of hydrometeorological (meteorological,
oceanographic and hydrological) parameters describing physical phenomena and processes occurring in the Caspian Sea and in the mouths of the rivers inflowing the Caspian Sea on the time scales from several hours to several decades;
"Observations of the state of the Caspian Sea" - measurements and visual observations of the set of hydrometeorological parameters describing physical phenomena and processes occurring in the Caspian Sea and in the mouths of the rivers inflowing the Caspian Sea;
"Observation network" - a system of stationary and mobile (floating) marine sites to observe the state of the Caspian Sea;
"Information on the state of the Caspian Sea" - actual (directly observed at a given moment) and summarized (regime and climatic) observation data on and predictions of the state of the Caspian Sea;
"Acquisition of information on the state of the Caspian Sea" - activity to observe the state of the Caspian Sea and to collect and process observation data with a view to acquiring summarized (regime and climatic) data on and predictions of the state of the Caspian Sea;
"Regional system for obtaining and exchanging information on the state of the Caspian Sea" - a combination of observation networks and facilities for observing, processing and disseminating information on the state of the Caspian Sea, belonging to the States of the Parties.
