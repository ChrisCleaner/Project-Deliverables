Regulation 1
Definitions For the purposes of this Annex:
(1) "Chemical tanker" means a ship constructed or adapted primarily to carry a cargo of noxious liquid substances in bulk and includes an "oil tanker" as defined in Annex I of the present Convention when carrying a cargo or part cargo of noxious liquid substances in bulk.
(2) "Clean ballast" means ballast carried in a tank which, since it was last used to carry a cargo containing a substance in Category A, B, C or D has been thoroughly cleaned and the residues resulting therefrom have been discharged and the tank emptied in accordance with the appropriate requirements of this Annex.
(3) "Segregated ballast" means ballast water introduced into a tank permanently allocated to the carriage of ballast or to the carriage of ballast or cargoes other than oil or noxious liquid substances as variously defined in the Annexes of the present Convention, and which is completely separated from the cargo and oil fuel system.
(4) "Nearest land" is as defined in Regulation 1(9) of Annex I of the present Convention.
(5) "Liquid substances" are those having a vapour pressure not exceeding 2.8 kp/cm2 at a temperature of 37.8°C.
(6) "Noxious liquid substance" means any substance designated in Appendix II to this Annex or provisionally assessed under the provisions of Regulation 3(4) as falling into Category A, B, C or D.
(7) "Special area" means a sea area where for recognized technical reasons in relation to its oceanographic and ecological condition and to its peculiar transportation traffic the adoption of special mandatory methods for the prevention of sea pollution by noxious liquid substances is required.
Special areas shall be:
(a) The Baltic Sea Area, and
(b) The Black Sea Area.
(8) "Baltic Sea Area" is as defined in Regulation l0(l)(b) of Annex I of the present Convention.
(9) "Black Sea Area" is as defined in Regulation 10(1)(c) of Annex I of the present Convention.
Regulation 2 Application
(1) Unless expressly provided otherwise the provisions of this Annex shall apply to all ships carrying noxious liquid substances in bulk.
(2) Where a cargo subject to the provisions of Annex I of the present Convention is carried in a cargo space of a chemical tanker, the appropriate requirements of Annex I of the present Convention shall also apply.
(3) Regulation 13 of this Annex shall apply only to ships carrying substances which are categorized for discharge control purposes in Category A, B or C.
Regulation 3
Categorization and Listing of Noxious Liquid Substances
(1) For the purpose of the Regulations of this Annex, except Regulation 13, noxious liquid substances shall be divided into four categories as follows:
(a) Category A - Noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a major hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause serious harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore justify the application of stringent anti-pollution measures.
(b) Category B - Noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore justify the application of special anti-pollution measures.
(c) Category C - Noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a minor hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause minor harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore require special operational conditions.
(d) Category D - Noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a recognizable hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause minimal harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore require some attention in operational conditions.
(2) Guidelines for use in the categorization of noxious liquid substances are given in Appendix Ito this Annex.
(3) The list of noxious liquid substances carried in bulk and presently categorized which are subject to the provisions of this Annex is set out in Appendix II to this Annex.
(4) Where it is proposed to carry a liquid substance in bulk which has not been categorized under paragraph (1) of this Regulation or evaluated as referred to in Regulation 4(1) of this Annex, the Governments of Parties to the Convention involved in the proposed operation shall establish and agree on a provisional assessment for the proposed operation on the basis of the guidelines referred to in paragraph (2) of this Regulation. Until full agreement between the Governments involved has been reached, the substance shall be carried under the most severe conditions proposed. As soon as possible, but not later than ninety days after its first carriage, the Administration concerned shall notify the Organization and provide details of the substance and the provisional assessment for prompt circulation to all Parties for their information and consideration. The Government of each Party shall have a period of ninety days in which to forward its comments to the Organization, with a view to the assessment of the substance.
Regulation 4
Other Liquid Substances
(1) The substances listed in Appendix III to this Annex have been evaluated and found to fall outside the Categories A, B, C and D, as defined in Regulation 3(1) of this Annex because they are presently considered to present no harm to human health, marine resources, amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea, when discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations.
(2) The discharge of bilge or ballast water or other residues or mixtures containing only substances listed in Appendix III to this Annex shall not be subject to any requirement of this Annex.
(3) The discharge into the sea of clean ballast or segregated ballast shall not be subject to any requirement of this Annex.

(2) If a ship at the time when the Certificate expires is not in a port or offshore terminal under the jurisdiction of the Party to the Convention whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the Certificate may be extended by the Administration, but such extension shall be granted only for the purpose of allowing the ship to complete its voyage to the State whose flag the ship is entitled to fly or in which it is to be surveyed and then only in cases where it appears proper and reasonable to do so.
(3) No Certificate shall be thus extended for a period longer than five months and a ship to which such extension is granted shall not on its arrival in the State whose flag it is entitled to fly or the port in which it is to be surveyed, be entitled by virtue of such extension to leave that port or State without having obtained a new Certificate.
(4) A Certificate which has not been extended 'under the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Regulation may be extended by the Administration for a period of grace of up to one month from the date of expiry stated on it.
(5) A Certificate shall cease to be valid if significant alterations have taken place in the structure, equipment, fittings, arrangements and material required by this Annex without the sanction of the Administration, except the direct replacement of such equipment or fitting for the purpose of repair or maintenance or if inter-mediate surveys as specified by the Administration under Regulation 10(1)(c) of this Annex are not carried out.
(6) A Certificate issued to a ship shall cease to be valid upon transfer of such a ship to the flag of another State, except as provided in paragraph (7) of this Regulation.
(7) Upon transfer of a ship to the flag of another Party, the Certificate shall remain in force for a period not exceeding five months provided that it would not have expired before the end of that period, or until the Administration issues a replacement Certificate, whichever is earlier. As soon as possible after the transfer has taken place the Government of the Party whose flag the ship was formerly entitled to fly shall transmit to the Administration a copy of the Certificate carried by the ship before the transfer and, if available, a copy of the relevant survey report.
Regulation 13
Requirements for Minimizing accidental Pollution
(1) The design, construction, equipment and operation of ships carrying noxious liquid substances in bulk which are subject to the provisions of this Annex shall be such as to minimize the uncontrolled discharge into the sea of such substances.
(2) Pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Regulation, the Government of each Party shall issue, or cause to be issued, detailed requirements on the design, construction, equipment and operation of such ships.
(3) In respect of chemical tankers, the requirements referred to in paragraph (2) of this Regulation shall contain at least all the provisions given in the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk adopted by the Assembly of the Organization in Resolution A.212(VII) and as may be amended by the Organization, provided that the amendments to that Code are adopted and brought into force in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the present Convention for amendment procedures to an Appendix to an Annex.

GUIDELINES FOR THE CATEGORIZATION OF
NOXIOUS LIQUID SUBSTANCES
Category A Substances which are bioaccumulated and liable to produce a hazard to aquatic life or human health; or which are highly toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a Hazard Rating 4, defined by a TLm less than 1 ppm); and additionally certain substances which are moderately toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a Hazard Rating 3, defined by a TLm of 1 or more, but less than 10 ppm) when particular weight is given to additional factors in the hazard profile or to special characteristics of the substance.
Category B Substances which are bioaccumulated with a short retention of the order of one week or less; or which are liable to produce tainting of the sea food; or which are moderately toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a Hazard Rating 3, defined by a TLm of 1 ppm or more, but less than 10 ppm); and additionally certain substances which are slightly toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a Hazard Rating 2, defined by a TLm of 10 ppm or more, but less than 100 ppm) when particular weight is given to additional factors in the hazard profile or to special characteristics of the substance.
Category C Substances which are slightly toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a Hazard Rating 2, defined by a TLm of 10 or more, but less than 100 ppm); and additionally certain substances which are practically non-toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a Hazard Rating 1, defined by a TLm of 100 ppm or more, but less than 1,000 ppm) when particular weight is given to additional factors in the hazard profile or to special characteristics of the substance.
Category D Substances which are practically non-toxic to aquatic life, (as expressed by a Hazard Rating 1, defined by a TLm of 100 ppm or more, but less than 1,000 ppm); or causing deposits blanketing the seafloor with a high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD); or highly hazardous to human health, with an LD50 of less than 5 mg/kg; or produce moderate reduction of amenities because of persistency, smell or poisonous or irritant characteristics, possibly interfering with use of beaches; or moderately hazardous to human health, with an LD50 of 5 mg/kg or more, but less than 50 mg/kg and produce slight reduction of amenities.
Other Liquid Substances (for the purposes of Regulation 4 of this Annex) Substances other than those categorized in Categories A, B, C and D above.
