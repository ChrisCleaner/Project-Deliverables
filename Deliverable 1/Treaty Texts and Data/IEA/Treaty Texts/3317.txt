At the 52nd Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Adelaide, Australia, 3 - 6 July 2000 no modifications were made to the provision for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons. The following amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling are therefore necessary (changes in bold type):
Paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
Substitute the dates 2000/2001 pelagic season, 2001 coastal season, 2001 season, or 2001 as appropriate.
These amendments become effective with respect to each Contracting Government ninety days following the date of this letter, in accordance with Article V of the Convention, unless any Contracting Government lodges an objection, in which case the procedure under Article V, paragraph 3 of the Convention will be followed.
The ninety days period will expire on 15 October 2000. In the absence of objections by that date the amendments will become effective. Contracting Governments will be notified accordingly.
Contracting Governments are reminded that Article V paragraph 3 of the Convention requires them to acknowledge receipt of this notification of amendments. In order to encourage compliance with this requirement, a form of acknowledgement is attached, to be completed and returned by post, fax or-email as is most convenient.
Dr. R. Gambell
Secretary to the Commission
