7. Decide on the status of the organosilicon compounds in the Dumping protocol as follows:
Status of organosilicon compounds in the Protocol for the prevention of pollution of the Mediterranean Sea by dumping from ships and aircraft
The Contracting Parties:
- Considering recent scientific evidence regarding the toxicity and persistence of organosilicon compounds, and their status as actual or potential marine pollutants;
- Further considering that any future control measures becoming necessary can be adequately covered by the provisions of annex I, item 5 and annex II, item 1(iv) to the above-mentioned Protocol;
- Agree to amend annex I to the Protocol for the prevention of pollution of the Mediterranean Sea by dumping from ships and aircraft, by deleting item 2 thereof - &quot;Organosilicon compounds and compounds which may form such substances in the marine environment, excluding those which are non-toxic or which are rapidly converted in the sea into substances which are biologically harmless, provided that they do not make edible marine organisms unpalatable&quot;.
