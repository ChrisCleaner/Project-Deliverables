4 Paragraph 4.4.5 is replaced by the following:
".5 Persistent floaters with a viscosity equal to or greater than 50 mPas at 20ºC and/or a melting point equal to or greater than 0ºC
This section should contain instructions on how to deal with tank washings of substances identified by the presence of '16.2.7' in column 'o' of chapter 17 of the IBC Code and the latest version of the MEPC.2/Circular, when operating in the areas specified in regulation 13.9 of Annex II."
Addendum A – Flow diagrams – Cleaning of cargo tanks and disposal of tank washings/ballast containing residues of category X, Y and Z substances
5 A new Note 4 is inserted after existing Note 3 as follows:
"Note 4: Within the areas specified in regulation 13.9 of Annex II, regulation 13.7.1.4 applies to substances that are identified by '16.2.7' in column 'o' of chapter 17 of the IBC Code."
APPENDIX VI – PREWASH PROCEDURES
6 A new section C is added after existing paragraph 21 as follows:
"C For all ships
Prewash procedures for persistent floaters to which regulation 13.7.1.4 of Annex II of MARPOL applies
Persistent floaters with a viscosity equal to or greater than 50 mPas at 20ºC and/or a melting point equal to or greater than 0ºC, shall be treated as solidifying or high-viscosity substances for the purposes of the prewash. Where it is determined that the use of small amounts of cleaning additives would improve and maximize the removal of cargo residues during a prewash, then this should be done in consultation and with prior agreement from the reception facility."
