(b) was involved in any incident in which an authorised officer or observer was allegedly assaulted with resultant bodily harm, physically threatened, forcefully resisted, refused boarding or subjected to physical intimidation or physical interference in the performance of his or her duties as authorised pursuant to this Treaty; or
that there was probable cause to believe that a fishing vessel of the United States:

4.8 Prior to instituting any legal proceedings pursuant to this Article concerning an alleged infringement of this Treaty in waters within the jurisdiction, for any purpose, as recognised by international law, of a Pacific Island party, the Government of the United States shall notify the Government of that Pacific Island party that such proceedings shall be instituted.

(c) where the vessel in respect of which application for a licence has been made does not have good standing on the Regional Register of Foreign Fishing Vessels, maintained by the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency, provided that:
(i) good standing is withdrawn only as a result of:
(A) the commission of a serious offence against fisheries laws or regulations of a Pacific Island State and the operator has not fully complied with any civil or criminal judgment rendered with respect to such an offence;
(B) evidence existing that gives reasonable cause to believe that the operator has committed a serious offence against the fisheries laws or regulations of any Pacific Island State and that it has not been possible to bring the vessel operator to trial; or

(ii) the Pacific Island party requesting withdrawal of good standing has first consulted the Government of the United States and has made all reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute in question before utilizing the procedures for withdrawal of good standing;

PAYMENTS
The following amounts are payable annually for a period of five (5) years pursuant to paragraph 3 of Annex II.
PART 1
1. The amounts payable as set forth in this paragraph.
(a) Annual industry payments shall be made as follows:
(i) for the first annual Licensing Period, a lump sum of US$1.75 million for 35 vessels, with the next five licences to be made available for the same pro-rata payment as the first 35 licences, and an additional 10 licences to be made available at US$60,000 per vessel;
(ii) for subsequent annual Licensing Periods, 40 vessel licences calculated on the same basis as the first 40 vessel licences in sub-paragraph (i) and indexed to the price of fish as set forth below, with 10 additional licences to be made available at US$60,000 per vessel and indexed to the price of fish as set forth below.
(b) The indexation shall be applied as follows:
(i) Definitions
A. Base Vessel Payment: The Base Vessel Payment is US$50,000 for the first 40 vessels to be licensed and US$60,000 for vessels to be licensed in excess of 40 vessels.
B. Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment: The Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment is the individual vessel payment of each annual Licensing Period after the first annual Licensing Period. The Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment will always apply to the Licensing Period immediately following its calculation.
C. Landed Price: The Landed Price is the published standard price per ton (American Tuna Sales Association) for fish delivered to American Samoa prevailing at the time a United States purse seine vessel arrives in port for the purpose of offloading its catch.
D. Average Landed Price: The Average Landed Price is calculated by averaging the established landed price categories for yellowfin and skipjack tuna in American Samoa. The landed price categories to be used are: over 7.5 pounds, 4 to 7.5 pounds and 3 to 4 pounds for skipjack; over 20 pounds, 7.5 to 20 pounds and 4 to 7.5 pounds for yellowfin.
E. Base Price: The Base Price is the Average Landed Price for the three months prior to the Treaty entering into force.
F. Estimated Landed Value: The Estimated Landed Value is the Average Landed Price in effect at the time of a vessel's landing weighted by the yellowfin/skipjack mix ratio to be calculated from information on Schedule 6 for that vessel.
G. Average Estimated Landed Value: The Average Estimated Landed Value is the Estimated Landed Value for all landings by United States purse seine vessels in American Samoa in the four quarters preceding the final quarter of the applicable Licensing Period divided by the total number of those landings for the same period.
(ii) Calculation and application of indexing factor
A. To obtain the indexing factor by which the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment shall be calculated, divide the Average Estimated Landed Value for the preceding four quarters by the Base Price.
B. To obtain the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment, multiply the Base Vessel Payment by the indexing factor obtained in Paragraph (ii)A.
C. In no case shall the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment be less than the Base Vessel Payment.
(iii) Notifications
The established prices and any changes shall be supplied to the Administrator by the Government of the United States within ten (10) days of their publication. The Administrator shall notify the Government of the United States sixty (60) days before the start of each Licensing Period of the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment along with the computation used to arrive at the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment. The Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment shall become final thirty (30) days after receipt by the Government of the United States, unless the Government of the United States advises the Administrator otherwise, in which case consultations shall be held.
(iv) Consultations
If the established price categories are revised, or if there is a change in the tuna industry structure which makes the price calculations as set forth above inappropriate, the Administrator may consult with representatives of the Government of the United States as necessary to revise the formula.
(c) There shall be no pro-ration of the Base Vessel Payment or the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment. There shall be no refunds of the Base Vessel Payment or the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment following licence issuance pursuant to Annex II.
2. Sums payable pursuant to the related Agreement between the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency and the Government of the United States.
PART 2
3. Technical assistance, including provision of assistance by technicians, by the United States tuna industry valued at US$250,000 annually in response to requests co-ordinated through the Administrator.

AGREED STATEMENT ON OBSERVER PROGRAMME
Representatives of the Governments of the Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America have agreed on provisions relating to observers in Annex I, Part 6 of the Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America.
The Representatives recognise that the provision for an observer programme is necessary to implement and achieve the objectives of the Treaty.
The Representatives also acknowledge the desirability of providing appropriate administrative measures pursuant to Annex I, Part 6 of the Treaty.
Therefore, the representatives agree as follows:
(a) observer operations would be based on the placement of observers at ports of trip origin for complete trips unless otherwise agreed at the outset of the trip;
(b) the United States Government would be notified of observer placements by an Observer Coordinator nominated by the Pacific Island parties;
(c) The Pacific Island parties would use their best endeavours to ensure that a reasonable period of notice was given, which should, wherever practicable, be at least fourteen (14) days;
(d) the United States Government would use its best endeavours to ensure that the Observer Coordinator is kept informed of the expected pattern of port departures and of the planned fishing activities of departing vessels;
(e) the United States Government would facilitate the placing of observers including the provision of visas;
(f) the United States Government would notify the Observer Coordinator of any difficulties involving the discharge of the duties of observers; and
(g) that it is anticipated observers will use the same range of equipment used by United States observers; and there will be a training program in the use of equipment, but crew will also be expected to assist observers in the use of equipment.
