CIRCULAR COMMUNICATION TO COMMISSIONERS AND CONTRACTING GOVERNMENTS (IWC.CCG.1028)
Notification of Amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling 1946
No modifications were made to provisions for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and 1985/86 pelagic seasons during the 64th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Panama City, Panama from 2-6 July 2012.
Therefore following amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling are necessary (changes in bold italics type):
Paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
- Substitute the dates 2011/12 pelagic season and 2012 coastal season for 2012/13 pelagic season and 2013 coastal season as appropriate.
In addition, at IWC/64, the Commission agreed by three-fourths majority vote a proposal to amend the Schedule to establish Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling catch limits for bowhead whales from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas, for gray whales from the Eastern stock in the North Pacific and for humpback whales around St. Vincent and the Grenadines. These changes are shown in paragraphs 13. (b) 1i, 13. (b) 2i and 13. (b) 4 respectively of the attached Schedule.
No further changes to the Schedule were agreed by the Commission at its 64th Annual Meeting.
In accordance with Article V of the Convention, these amendments become effective with respect to each Contracting Government ninety days following the date of this letter, unless any Contracting Government lodges an objection, in which case the procedure under Article V, paragraph 3 of the Convention will be followed.
The 90 days period will expire on 6 November 2012. In the absence of objections by that date the amendments will become effective. Contracting Governments will be notified accordingly.
Contracting Governments are reminded that Article V paragraph 3 of the Convention requires them to acknowledge receipt of this notification of amendments. In order to encourage compliance with this requirement a form is attached which can be returned by post or electronically by email as is most convenient.
