AMENDMENTS TO SCHEDULE
The Secretary refers to his circular letter of 6 July 1971, [1] notifying Contracting Governments of the amendments to the Schedule to the Convention agreed at the Commission's Twenty-third Annual Meeting.
In a Note dated 1 October 1971 from the Japanese Ambassador in London, a copy of which is enclosed, [1] the Secretary has been informed that the Government of Japan objects to the amendment to add the new sub-paragraph (j) to paragraph 8 of the Schedule.
In accordance with Article V (3) of the Convention the amendment to add sub-paragraph 8(j) will now remain inoperative for an additional period of 90 days from 4 October 1971 when in the absence of further objections the amendment to add sub-paragraph 8(j) will become binding on all Contracting Governments except the Government of Japan. The 90 day period will end at midnight on 2 January 1972.
No objections have been received to the other amendments proposed at the Twenty-third Meeting, i.e. to paragraphs 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), 8(a), 8(f), 8(g), 8(h), 8(i), and these amendments, which are repeated overleaf, therefore become binding on all Contracting Governments from 5 October 1971.
The Secretary requests an acknowledgment of the receipt of this letter, a copy of which is being sent to all Commissioners.
