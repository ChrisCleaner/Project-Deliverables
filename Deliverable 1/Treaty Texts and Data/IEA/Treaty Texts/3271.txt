At the [International Whaling Commission's] 49th Annual Meeting, held in Monte Carlo, Monaco, 20-24 October 1997, the following amendments to the Schedule were adopted (changes in bold type):
Revise paragraph 13(b)(1) to read:
(1) The taking of bowhead whales from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea stock by aborigines is permitted, but only when the meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines, and further provided that:
(i) For the years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, the number of bowhead whales landed shall not exceed 280. For each of these years the number of bowhead whales struck shall not exceed 67, except that any unused portion of a strike quota from any year (including 15 unused strikes from the 1995-97 quota) shall be carried forward and added to the strike quotas of any subsequent years, provided that no more than 15 strikes shall be added to the strike quota for any one year.
(ii) It is forbidden to strike, take or kill calves or any bowhead whale accompanied by a calf.
(iii) This provision shall be reviewed annually by the Commission in light of the advice of the Scientific Committee, particularly its advice arising from the 1998 Comprehensive Assessment .
Revised paragraph 13(b)(2) to read:
(2) The taking of gray whales from the Eastern stock in the North Pacific is permitted, but only by aborigines or a Contracting Party on behalf of aborigines, and then only when the meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines whose traditional aboriginal subsistence and cultural needs have been recognised.
(i) For the years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, the number of gray whales taken in accordance with this sub-paragraph shall not exceed 620, provided that the number of gray whales taken in any one of the years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 or 2002 shall not exceed 140.
(ii) It is forbidden to strike, take or kill calves or any gray whale accompanied by a calf.
(iii) This provision shall be reviewed annually by the Commission in light of the advice of the Scientific Committee.
Amend Table 1 to replace the number "140" with a dot in the appropriate column, retaining the footnote.
Revise paragraph 13(b)(3) to read:
The taking by aborigines of minke whales from the West Greenland and Central stocks and fin whales from the West Greenland stock is permitted and then only when the meat and products are to be used exclusively for local consumption.
(i) The number of fin whales from the West Greenland stock taken in accordance with this subparagraph shall not exceed the limits shown in Table 1.
(ii) The number of minke whales from the Central stock taken in accordance with this subparagraph shall not exceed 12 in each of the years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, except that any unused portion of the quota for each year shall be carried forward from that year and added to the quota of any subsequent years, provided that no more than 3 shall be added to the quota for any one year.
(iii) The number of minke whales struck from the West Greenland stock shall not exceed 175 in each of the years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, except that any unused portion of the strike quota for each year shall be carried forward from that year and added to the strike quota of any subsequent years, provided that no more than 15 strikes shall be added to the strike quota for any one year. This provision will be reviewed if new scientific data become available within the 5 year period and if necessary amended on the basis of the advice of the Scientific Committee.
Amend Table 1 as follows:
(a) In column FIN, footnote 2 should read as follows:
Available to be taken by aborigines pursuant to paragraph 13(b)(3). Catch limit for each of the years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 .
(b) In column MINKE, the number 12 should be substituted by a dot.
The following additional changes are also necessary:
Paragraphs 11 and 12 and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
Substitute the dates 1997/98 pelagic season, 1998 coastal season, 1998 season, or 1998 as appropriate.
These amendments become effective with respect to each Contracting Government ninety days following the date of the International Whaling Commission's letter of notification, in accordance with Article V of the Convention, unless any Contracting Government lodges an objection, in which case the procedure under Article V, paragraph 3 of the Convention will be followed.
The ninety days period will expire on 3 February 1998. In the absence of objections by that date the amendments will become effective. Contracting Governments will be notified accordingly.
