BEING DEEPLY CONCERNED at the continued loss of ships carrying solid bulk cargoes, sometimes without a trace, and the heavy loss of life incurred,
RECOGNIZING the urgent need to further improve minimum standards of competence of crews sailing on ships carrying solid bulk cargoes, to avoid recurrence of such casualties,
HAVING CONSIDERED the report of the ad hoc Working Group on Bulk Carrier Safety convened by the Committee during its sixty-seventh and sixty-eighth sessions,
HAVING ALSO CONSIDERED, at its seventieth session, amendments to part A of the STCW Code proposed and circulated in accordance with Article XII(1)(a)(i) of the Convention,
1. Adopts, in accordance with Article XII(1)(a)(iv) of the Convention, amendments to the STCW Code, the text of which is set out in the Annex to the present resolution;

Determines, in accordance with Article XII(1)(a)(vii)(2) of the Convention, that the said amendments to the STCW Code shall be deemed to have been accepted on 1 July 2002, unless, prior to that date more than one third of Parties or Parties the combined merchant fleets of which constitute not less than 50% of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant shipping of ships of 100 gross tonnage or more, have notified their objections to the amendments;
3. Invites Parties to the Convention to note that, in accordance with Article XII(1)(a)(ix) of the Convention, the annexed amendments to the STCW Code shall enter into force on 1 January 2003 upon their acceptance in accordance with paragraph 2 above;
4. Requests the Secretary-General, in conformity with Article XII(1)(a)(v) of the Convention, to transmit certified copies of the present resolution and the text of the amendments contained in the Annex to all Parties to the Convention; and
5. Further requests the Secretary-General to transmit copies of this resolution and its Annex to Members of the Organization which are not Parties to the Convention.
