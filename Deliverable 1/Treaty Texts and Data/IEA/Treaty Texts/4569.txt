".31 Oil residue (sludge) means the residual waste oil products generated during the normal operation of a ship such as those resulting from the purification of fuel or lubricating oil for main or auxiliary machinery, separated waste oil from oil filtering equipment, waste oil collected in drip trays, and waste hydraulic and lubricating oils.
.32 Oil residue (sludge) tank means a tank which holds oil residue (sludge) from which sludge may be disposed directly through the standard discharge connection or any other approved means of disposal.
.33 Oily bilge water means water which may be contaminated by oil resulting from things such as leakage or maintenance work in machinery spaces. Any liquid entering the bilge system including bilge wells, bilge piping, tank top or bilge holding tanks is considered oily bilge water.
.34 Oily bilge water holding tank means a tank collecting oily bilge water prior to its discharge, transfer or disposal."
Regulation 12 - Tanks for oil residues (sludge)
2 Paragraph 1 is amended to read as follows:
"1 Every ship of 400 gross tonnage and above shall be provided with a tank or tanks of adequate capacity, having regard to the type of machinery and length of voyage, to receive the oil residues (sludge) which cannot be dealt with otherwise in accordance with the requirements of this Annex."
3 The following new paragraph 2 is inserted, after the existing paragraph 1:
"2 Oil residue (sludge) may be disposed of directly from the oil residue (sludge) tank(s) through the standard discharge connection referred to in regulation 13, or any other approved means of disposal. The oil residue (sludge) tank(s):
.1 shall be provided with a designated pump for disposal that is capable of taking suction from the oil residue (sludge) tank(s); and
.2 shall have no discharge connections to the bilge system, oily bilge water holding tank(s), tank top or oily water separators except that the tank(s) may be fitted with drains, with manually operated self-closing valves and arrangements for subsequent visual monitoring of the settled water, that lead to an oily bilge water holding tank or bilge well, or an alternative arrangement, provided such arrangement does not connect directly to the bilge piping system."
4 Existing paragraphs 2 and 3 are renumbered 3 and 4, respectively.
Regulations 12, 13, 17 and 38
