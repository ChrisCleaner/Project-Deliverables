Source: http://www.aseansec.org/agr_haze.pdf, 20040817
The Parties to this Agreement,
REAFFIRMING the commitment to the aims and purposes of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as set forth in the Bangkok Declaration of 8 August 1967, in particular to promote regional co-operation in Southeast Asia in the spirit of equality and partnership and thereby contribute towards peace, progress and prosperity in the region,
RECALLING the Kuala Lumpur Accord on Environment and Development which was adopted by the ASEAN Ministers of Environment on 19 June 1990 which calls for, inter alia, efforts leading towards the harmonisation of transboundary pollution prevention and abatement practices,
RECALLING ALSO the adoption of the 1995 ASEAN Co-operation Plan on Transboundary Pollution, which specifically addressed transboundary atmospheric pollution and called for, inter alia, establishing procedures and mechanisms for co-operation among ASEAN Member States in the prevention and mitigation of land and/ or forest fires and haze,
DETERMINED to give effect to the 1997 Regional Haze Action Plan and to the Hanoi Plan of Action which call for fully implementing the 1995 ASEAN Cooperation Plan on Transboundary Pollution, with particular emphasis on the Regional Haze Action Plan by the year 2001,
RECOGNISING the existence of possible adverse effects of transboundary haze pollution,
CONCERNED that a rise in the level of emissions of air pollutants within the region as forecast may increase such adverse effects,
RECOGNISING the need to study the root causes and the implications of the transboundary haze pollution and the need to seek solutions for the problems identified, AFFIRMING their willingness to further strengthen international co-operation to develop national policies for preventing and monitoring transboundary haze pollution, AFFIRMING ALSO their willingness to co-ordinate national action for preventing and monitoring transboundary haze pollution through exchange of information, consultation, research and monitoring,
DESIRING to undertake individual and joint action to assess the origin, causes, nature and extent of land and/ or forest fires and the resulting haze, to prevent and control the sources of such land and/ or forest fires and the resulting haze by applying environmentally sound policies, practices and technologies and to strengthen national and regional capabilities and co-operation in assessment, prevention, mitigation and management of land and/ or forest fires and the resulting haze,
