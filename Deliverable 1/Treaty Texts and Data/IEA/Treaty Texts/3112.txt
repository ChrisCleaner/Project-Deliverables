    ï»¿CONVENTION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ANADROMOUS STOCKS IN THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN
Source: http://www.npafc.org/new/about_convention.html, 20040526
The Parties to this Convention:
Recognizing that anadromous stocks in the North Pacific Ocean originate primarily in the waters of Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States of America;
Recognizing that these stocks intermingle in certain areas of the North Pacific Ocean;
Recognizing that States in whose waters anadromous stocks originate have primary interest in and responsibility for such stocks;
Recognizing that fisheries for anadromous stocks should be conducted only in waters within 200 nautical miles of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured;

3. The Parties shall take appropriate measures, individually and collectively, in accordance with international law and their respective domestic laws, to prevent trafficking in anadromous fish taken in violation of the prohibitions provided for in this Convention, and to penalize persons involved in such trafficking.
ARTICLE IV
1. The Parties agree to invite the attention of any State or entity not party to this Convention to any matter relating to the fishing activities of its nationals, residents or vessels which could affect adversely the conservation of anadromous stocks within the Convention Area.

4. The Parties shall cooperate in taking action, consistent with international law and their respective domestic laws, for the prevention by any State or entity not party to this Convention of any directed fishing for, and the minimization by such State or entity of any incidental taking of, anadromous fish by nationals, residents or vessels of such State or entity in the Convention Area.
ARTICLE V
1. Each Party shall take all necessary measures to ensure that its nationals and fishing vessels flying its flag comply with the provisions of this Convention.
2. Any Party may enforce the provisions of this Convention within the Convention Area in accordance with the following:
(a) The duly authorized officials of any Party may board vessels of the other Parties which can be reasonably believed to be engaged in directed fishing for or incidental taking of anadromous fish to inspect equipment, logs, documents, catch and other articles and question the persons on board for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Convention. Such inspections and questioning shall be made so that the vessels suffer the minimum interference and inconvenience. Such officials shall present credentials issued by their respective Governments if requested by the master of the vessel.
(b) When any such person or vessel is actually engaged in operations in violation of the provisions of this Convention, or there is reasonable ground to believe was obviously so engaged prior to boarding of such vessel by any such official, the latter may arrest or seize such person or vessel and further investigate the circumstances if necessary. The Party to which the officia belongs shall notify promptly the Party to which such person or vessel belongs of such arrest or seizure, and shall deliver such person or vessel as promptly as practicable to the authorized officials of the Party to which such person or vessel belongs at a place to be agreed upon by both Parties. Provided, however, that when the Party which receives such notification cannot immediatery accept delivery, the notifying Party may maintain such arrest or seizure within the Convention Area, or within any convenient port which has been previously identified by the notifying Party in a communication to the other Parties to this Convention and to which there has been no objection within sixty (60) days of receipt of the communication, until the authorized officials of the Party to which such person or vessel belongs accept delivery.
(c) When the Party which receives such notification accepts delivery, the authorized officials of the Party shall conduct the investigations necessary to obtain the evidence needed for appropriate actions, including but not limited to trial, with respect to the offense. They shall also take, for the remainder of the relevant fishing season, immediate action as necessary to ensure that the person or vessel concerned is prevented from conducting further operations in violation of the provisions of this Convention. The action taken may include the placement of an enforcement official on board the vessel, restriction of the area in which the vessel is permitted to operate, or exclusion of the vessel from the Convention Area.
(d) Only the authorities of the Party to which the above-mentioned person or vessel belongs may try the offense and impose penalties therefor.
