THE CONTRACTING PARTIES,
CONSCIOUS of the need to facilitate and develop international transport by inland waterways in Europe,
AWARE of the expected increase in the international transport of goods as a result of growing international trade,
EMPHASIZING the important role of inland water transport, which in comparison with other modes of inland transport has economic and ecological advantages and offers spare infrastructure and vessel capacity and is therefore capable of lowering social costs and negative impacts on the environment by inland transport as a whole,
CONVINCED that, in order to make international inland water transport in Europe more efficient and attractive to customers, it is essential to establish a legal framework which lays down a coordinated plan for the development and construction of a network of inland waterways of international importance, based on agreed infrastructure and operational parameters,
HAVE AGREED as follows:
Article 1 DESIGNATION OF THE NETWORK
The Contracting Parties adopt the provisions of this Agreement as a coordinated plan for the development and construction of a network of inland waterways, hereinafter referred to as the "network of inland waterways of international importance" or "E waterway network", which they intend to undertake within the framework of their relevant programmes. The E waterway network consists of inland waterways and ports of international importance as described in annexes I and II to this Agreement.

Annex III
TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF INLAND WATERWAYS OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE
(a) Technical characteristics of E waterways
The main technical characteristics of E waterways shall generally be in conformity with the classification of European inland waterways set out in Table 1.
For the evaluation of different E waterways, the characteristics of classes IV - VII are to be used, taking account of the following principles:
(i) The class of a waterway shall be determined by the horizontal dimensions of motor vessels, barges and pushed convoys, and primarily by the main standardized dimension, namely their beam or width;
(ii) Only waterways meeting at least the basic requirements of class IV (minimum dimensions of vessels 80 m x 9.5 m) can be considered as E waterways. Restrictions of draught (less than 2.50 m) and of minimum height under bridges (less than 5.25 m) can be accepted only for existing waterways and as an exception;
(iii) When modernizing waterways of class IV (as well as smaller regional waterways), it is recommended that the parameters of at least class Va should be met;
(iv) New E waterways should, however, meet the requirements of class Vb as a minimum. In this regard, a minimum draught of 2.80 m should be ensured;
(v) When modernizing existing waterways and/or building new ones, vessels and convoys of greater dimensions should always be taken into account;
(vi) In order to ensure more efficient container transport, the highest possible bridge clearance value should be ensured in accordance with footnote 4 of Table 1 [6];
(vii) Inland waterways expected to carry a significant volume of container and ro-ro traffic should meet, as a minimum, the requirements of class Vb. An increase of 7% to 10% in the beam value of 11.4 m of specific vessels navigating on inland waterways of class Va and higher classes may also be envisaged in order to allow for future developments in container dimensions and easy transport of trailers;
(viii) On waterways with fluctuating water levels, the value of the recommended draught should correspond to the draught reached or exceeded for 240 days on average per year (or for 60% of the navigation period). The value of the recommended height under bridges (5.25, 7.00 or 9.10 m) should be ensured over the highest navigation level, where possible and economically reasonable;
(ix) A uniform class, draught and height under bridges should be ensured either for the whole waterway or at least for substantial sections thereof;
(x) Where possible, the parameters of adjacent inland waterways should be the same or similar;
(xi) The highest draught (4.50 m) and minimum bridge clearance (9.10 m) values should be ensured on all parts of the network that are directly connected with coastal routes;
(xii) A minimum bridge clearance of 7.00 m should be ensured on waterways that connect important sea ports with the hinterland and are suitable for efficient container and river-sea traffic;
(xiii) Coastal routes listed in annex I above are intended to ensure the integrity of the E waterways' network throughout Europe and are meant to be used, within the meaning of this Agreement, by river-sea vessels whose dimensions should, where possible and economically viable, meet the requirements for self-propelled units suitable for navigating on inland waterways of classes Va and VIb.
The following minimum requirements are considered necessary in order to make a waterway suitable for container transport:
inland navigation vessels with a width of 11.4 m and a length of approximately 110 m must be able to operate with three or more layers of containers; otherwise a permissible length of pushed convoys of 185 m should be ensured, in which case they could operate with two layers of containers.

[1] Classes I - III are not mentioned in this table, being of regional importance.
Footnotes to Table 1
[7] The first figure takes into account the existing situations, whereas the second one represents both future developments and, in some cases, existing situations.
[8] Allows for a safety clearance of about 0.30 m between the uppermost point of the vessel's structure or its load and a bridge.
[9] Allows for expected future developments in ro-ro, container and river-sea navigation.
[10][TAB]Checked for container transport:
5.25 m for vessels transporting 2 layers of containers;
7.00 m for vessels transporting 3 layers of containers;
9.10 m for vessels transporting 4 layers of containers.
50% of the containers may be empty or ballast should be used.
[11] Some existing waterways can be considered as class IV by virtue of the maximum permissible length for vessels and convoys, even though the maximum beam is 11.4 m and the maximum draught 4.00 m.
[12] The draught value for a particular inland waterway to be determined according to the local conditions.
[13] Convoys consisting of a larger number of barges can also be used on some sections of waterways of class VII. In this case, the horizontal dimensions may exceed the values shown in the table.
(b) Operational criteria for E waterways
E waterways should meet the following essential operational criteria in order to be able to ensure reliable international traffic:
(i) Through traffic should be ensured throughout the navigation period, with the exception of the breaks mentioned below;
(ii) The navigation period may be shorter than 365 days only in regions with severe climatic conditions, where the maintaining of channels free of ice in the winter season is not possible and a winter break is therefore necessary. In these cases, dates should be fixed for the opening and closure of navigation. The duration of breaks in the navigation period caused by natural phenomena such as ice, floods, etc. should be kept to a minimum by appropriate technical and organizational measures;
(iii) The duration of breaks in the navigation period for regular maintenance of locks and other hydraulic works should be kept to a minimum. Users of a waterway where maintenance work is planned should be kept informed of the dates and duration of the envisaged break in navigation. In cases of unforeseen failure of locks or other hydraulic facilities, or other force majeure, the duration of breaks should be kept as limited as possible using all appropriate measures to remedy the situation;
(iv) No breaks shall be admissible during low water periods. A reasonable limitation of admissible draught may nevertheless be allowed on waterways with fluctuating water levels. However, a minimum draught of 1.20 m should be ensured at all times, with the recommended or characteristic draught being ensured or exceeded for 240 days per year. In regions referred to in subparagraph (ii) above, the minimum draught of 1.20 m should be ensured for 60% of the navigation period on average;
(v) Operating hours of locks, movable bridges and other infrastructure works shall be such that round-the-clock (24-hour) navigation can be ensured on working days, if economically feasible. In specific cases, exceptions may be allowed due to organizational and/or technical reasons. Reasonable hours of navigation should also be ensured during public holidays and at weekends.
(c) Technical and operational characteristics of E ports
The network of E waterways shall be complemented by a system of inland navigation ports of international importance. Each E port should meet the following technical and operational criteria:
(i) It should be situated on an E waterway;
(ii) It should be capable of accommodating vessels or pushed convoys used on the relevant E waterway in conformity with its class;
(iii) It should be connected with main roads and railway lines (preferably belonging to the network of international roads and railway lines established by the European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries (AGR), the European Agreement on Main International Railway Lines (AGC) and the European Agreement on Important International Combined Transport Lines and Related Installations (AGTC));
(iv) Its aggregate cargo handling capacity should be at least 0.5 million tonnes a year;
(v) It should offer suitable conditions for the development of a port industrial zone;
(vi) It should provide for the handling of standardized containers (with the exception of ports specialized in bulk cargo handling);
(vii) All the facilities necessary for usual operations in international traffic should be available;
(viii) With a view to ensuring the protection of the environment, reception facilities for the disposal of waste generated on board ships should be available in ports of international importance.
Notes:
[1] Portions of E waterways which do not exist at present but which are included in relevant infrastructure development programmes are indicated in square brackets [...].
[2] Distances to ports on the river Elbe are measured: in Germany - from the Czech/German State border; in the Czech Republic - from the junction of rivers Elbe and Vltava at Melnik.
[3] Distance from Moskva Southern Port.
[4] Planned.
[5] Under construction or planned.
[6] If, however, the proportion of empty containers exceeds 50%, observance of a value for the minimum height under bridges which is higher than that indicated in footnote 4 should be considered.
