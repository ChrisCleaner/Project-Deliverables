This plan shall provide written procedures for collecting, storing, processing and disposing of garbage, including the use of the equipment on board.

Such a plan shall be in accordance with the guidelines developed by the Organization and written in the working language of the crew.
(3) Every ship of 400 tons gross tonnage and above and every ship which is certified to carry 15 persons or more engaged in voyages to ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of other Parties to the Convention and every fixed and floating platform engaged in exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed, shall be provided with a Garbage Record Book.

(a) each discharge operation, or completed incineration, shall be recorded in the Garbage Record Book and signed for on the date of the incineration or discharge by the officer in charge. Each completed page of the Garbage Record Book shall be signed by the master of the ship. The entries in the Garbage Record Book shall be both in an official language of the State whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, and in English or French. The entries in an official national language of the State whose flag the ship is entitled to fly shall prevail in case of a dispute or discrepancy;

(5) The competent authority of the Government of a Party to the Convention may inspect the Garbage Record Book on board any ship to which this regulation applies while the ship is in its ports or offshore terminals and may make a copy of any entry in that book, and may require the master of the ship to certify that the copy is a true copy of such an entry. Any copy so made, which has been certified by the master of the ship as a true copy of an entry in the ship's Garbage Record Book, shall be admissible in any judicial proceedings as evidence of the facts stated in the entry. The inspection of a Garbage Record Book and the taking of a certified copy by the competent authority under this paragraph shall be performed as expeditiously as possible without causing the ship to be unduly delayed.

APPENDIX

1. Introduction
In accordance with Regulation 9 of Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78) a record is to be kept of each discharge operation or completed incineration. This includes discharges at sea, to reception facilities, or to other ships.
2. Garbage and garbage management
Garbage includes all kinds of food, domestic and operational waste excluding fresh fish and parts thereof, generated during the normal operation of the vessel and liable to be disposed of continuously or periodically except those substances which are defined or listed in other annexes to MARPOL 73/78 (such as oil, sewage or noxious liquid substances).
The Guidelines for the Implementation of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 should also be referred to for relevant information.
3. Description of the garbage
The garbage is to be grouped into categories for the purposes of this record book as follows:
1. Plastics
2. Floating dunnage, lining, or packing material
3. Ground-down paper products, rags, glass, metal, bottles, crockery, etc.
4. Paper products, rags, glass, metal, bottles, crockery, etc.
5. Food waste
6. Incinerator ash
4. Entries in the Garbage Record Book
Entries in the Garbage Record Book shall be made on each of the following occasions:
(a) When garbage is discharged into the sea:
(i) Date and time of discharge
(ii) Position of the ship (latitude and longitude)
(iii) Category of garbage discharged
(iv) Estimated amount discharged for each category in m3
(v) Signature of the officer in charge of the operation.
(b) When garbage is discharged to reception facilities ashore or to other ships:
(i) Date and time of discharge
(ii) Port or facility, or name of ship
(iii) Category of garbage discharged
(iv) Estimated amount discharged for each category in m3
(v) Signature of officer in charge of the operation.
(c) When garbage is incinerated:
(i) Date and time of start and stop of incineration
(ii) Position of the ship (latitude and longitude)
(iii) Estimated amount incinerated in m3

4.2 Receipts
The master should obtain from the operator of port reception facilities, or from the master of the ship receiving the garbage, a receipt or certificate specifying the estimated amount of garbage transferred. The receipts or certificates must be kept on board the ship with the Garbage Record Book for two years.
4.3 Amount of garbage
The amount of garbage onboard should be estimated in m3, if possible separately according to category. The Garbage Record Book contains many references to estimated amount of garbage. It is recognized that the accuracy of estimating amounts of garbage is left to interpretation. Volume estimates will differ before and after processing. Some processing procedures may not allow for a usable estimate of volume, e.g. the continuous processing of food waste. Such factors should be taken into consideration when making and interpreting entries made in a record.
