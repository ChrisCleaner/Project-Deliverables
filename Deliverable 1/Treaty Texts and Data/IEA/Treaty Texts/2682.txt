Paragraph 5
After "8 November 1958" delete remainder of sentence and substitute "and again as a result of the eleventh meeting in London was rendered inoperative for a period of three years from 8 November 1959".
Paragraph 6(3)
Delete "1, 2, 3 and 4 February in any year" and insert "for four days commencing 20 January in any year".
Paragraph 7(a)
Delete "7 January" and substitute "28 December".
Paragraph 16
Delete in third line from bottom of paragraph:
"(b) The number and aggregate gross tonnage of the whale catchers",
and substitute
"(b) The number of whale catchers, including separate totals for surface vessels and aircraft and specifying, in the case of surface vessels, the average length and horse power of whale catchers.".
Paragraph 17(c)
Add the following:
"(4) on the Pacific coast of the United States of America between 35 degrees North Latitude and 49 degrees North Latitude.".
No action was taken in connection with the blue whale unit limit (paragraph 8(a)) and in the 1959/60 season this limit will therefore be fifteen thousand blue whale units.
