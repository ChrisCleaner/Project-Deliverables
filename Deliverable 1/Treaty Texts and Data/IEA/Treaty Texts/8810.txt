The Conference of the Parties,
Having considered the proposals by the Government of Norway to amend Annexes II, VIII and IX to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal,[1]
1. Decides to amend Annex II to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal by adding the following entry:
Y48 [2][3]
Plastic waste, including mixtures of such waste, with the exception of the following:
 =Plastic waste that is hazardous waste pursuant to paragraph 1 (a) of Article 1[4]
 =Plastic waste listed below, provided it is destined for recycling[5] in an environmentally sound manner and almost free from contamination and other types of wastes:[6] 
  .Plastic waste almost exclusively[7] consisting of one non-halogenated polymer, including but not limited to the following polymers: 
   -Polyethylene (PE)
   -Polypropylene (PP)
   -Polystyrene (PS)
   -Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) 
   -Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
   -Polycarbonates (PC)
   -Polyethers
  .Plastic waste almost exclusively[7] consisting of one cured resin or condensation product, including but not limited to the following resins:
   -Urea formaldehyde resins
   -Phenol formaldehyde resins
   -Melamine formaldehyde resins
   -Epoxy resins
   -Alkyd resins
  .Plastic waste almost exclusively[7] consisting of one of the following fluorinated polymers:[8] 
   -Perfluoroethylene/propylene (FEP)
   -Perfluoroalkoxy alkanes:
    +Tetrafluoroethylene/perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether (PFA)
    +Tetrafluoroethylene/perfluoromethyl vinyl ether (MFA)
   -Polyvinylfluoride (PVF)
   -Polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF)
 =Mixtures of plastic waste, consisting of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and/or polyethylene terephthalate (PET), provided they are destined for separate recycling[9] of each material and in an environmentally sound manner and almost free from contamination and other types of wastes.[6]
2. Also decides to amend Annex VIII to the Basel Convention by inserting a new entry, A3210, as follows:
A3210[10]
Plastic waste, including mixtures of such waste, containing or contaminated with Annex I constituents, to an extent that it exhibits an Annex III characteristic (note the related entries Y48 in Annex II and on list B B3011).
3. Further decides to amend the entry B3010 in Annex IX to the Basel Convention by adding a new footnote to the entry, as follows: “Entry B3010 is effective until 31 December 2020. Entry B3011 becomes effective as of 1 January 2021.”
4. Decides to amend Annex IX to the Basel Convention by inserting a new entry, B3011, as follows:
B3011[11]
Plastic waste (note the related entries Y48 in Annex II and on list A A3210):
 =Plastic waste listed below, provided it is destined for recycling[5] in an environmentally sound manner and almost free from contamination and other types of wastes:[6] 
  .Plastic waste almost exclusively[7] consisting of one non-halogenated polymer, including but not limited to the following polymers: 
   -Polyethylene (PE)
   -Polypropylene (PP)
   -Polystyrene (PS)
   -Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) 
   -Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
   -Polycarbonates (PC)
   -Polyethers
  .Plastic waste almost exclusively[7] consisting of one cured resin or condensation product, including but not limited to the following resins:
   -Urea formaldehyde resins
   -Phenol formaldehyde resins
   -Melamine formaldehyde resins
   -Epoxy resins
   -Alkyd resins
  .Plastic waste almost exclusively[7] consisting of one of the following fluorinated polymers:[8] 
   -Perfluoroethylene/propylene (FEP)
   -Perfluoroalkoxy alkanes:
    +Tetrafluoroethylene/perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether (PFA)
    +Tetrafluoroethylene/perfluoromethyl vinyl ether (MFA)
   -Polyvinylfluoride (PVF)
   -Polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF)
 =Mixtures of plastic waste, consisting of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and/or polyethylene terephthalate (PET), provided they are destined for separate recycling[9] of each material and in an environmentally sound manner, and almost free from contamination and other types of wastes.[6]
