b) within that part of the Atlantic Ocean north of 59o north latitude and between 44o west longitude and 42o west longitude.
2. The Convention area shall be divided into regions, the boundaries of which shall be those defined in the Annex to this Convention. The regions shall be subject to such alterations as may be made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4) of Article 5 of this Convention.

a) the expression "vessel" means any vessel or boat employed in fishing for sea fish or in the treatment of sea fish which is registered or owned in the territories of, or which flies the flag of, any Contracting States and;
b) the expression "territories" in relation to any Contracting State, extends to
(i) any territory within or adjacent to the Convention area for whose international relations the Contracting State is responsible;
(ii) any other territory, not situated within the Convention area or adjacent to it, for whose international relations the Contracting State is responsible and for which such State shall have made known, by written declaration to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereinafter referred to as the Government of the United Kingdom), either at the time of signature, of ratification, or of adherence, or subsequently, that this Convention shall apply to it;
(iii) the waters within the Convention area where the Contracting State has exclusive jurisdiction over fisheries
Article 2
Nothing in this Convention shall be deemed to affect the rights, claims, or views of any Contracting State in regard to the extent of jurisdiction over fisheries.
Article 3
1. A North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) is hereby established and shall be maintained for the purposes of this Convention.
2. Each Contracting State may appoint as its Delegation to the Commission not more than two Commissioners and such experts and advisors to assist them as that State may determine.
3. The Commission shall elect its own President and not more than two Vice-Presidents who need not be chosen from the Commissioners or their experts or advisers. If a member of a Delegation has been elected President he shall forthwith cease to act as a member of that Delegation, and if a Commissioner has been elected the State concerned shall have the right to appoint another person to serve in his place.
4. The Office of the Commission shall be in London.
5. Except where the Commission determines otherwise, it shall meet once a year in London at such time as it shall decide: provided, however, that upon the request of a Commissioner of a Contracting State, the President shall, as soon as practicable, summon a meeting at such time and place as he may determine.
6. The Commission shall appoint its own Secretary and may from time to time appoint such other staff as it may require.
7. The Commission may set up such Committees as it considers desirable to perform such functions as it may determine.
8. Each Delegation shall have one vote in the Commission which may be cast only by a Commissioner of the State concerned. Decisions shall be taken by a simple majority except where otherwise specifically provided. If there is an even division of votes on any matter which is subject to a simple majority decision, the proposal shall be regarded as rejected.
9. Subject to the provisions of this Article, the Commission shall draw up its own Rules of Procedure, including provisions for the election of the President and Vice-Presidents and their terms of office.

11. Reports of the proceedings of the Commission shall be transmitted and proposals and recommendations shall be notified as soon as possible to all Contracting States in English and in French.
Article 4
1. Each Contracting State shall pay the expense of the Commissioners, experts and advisers appointed by it.

4. In any year in which the annual budget exceeds 200 pounds for each Contracting State, the Commission shall calculate the payments due from each Contracting State according to the following formula:
a) from the budget there shall be deducted a sum of 200 pounds for each Contracting State;
b) the remainder shall be divided into such number of equal shares as correspond to the total number of Regional Committee memberships;
c) the payment due from any Contracting State shall be the equivalent of 200 pounds plus the number of shares equal to the number of Regional Committees in which that State participates.
5. The Commission shall notify to each Contracting State the sum due from that State as calculated under paragraph (3) or (4) of this Article and as soon as possible thereafter each Contracting State shall pay to the Commission the sum so notified.

7. At its first meeting the Commission shall approve a budget for the balance of the first financial year in which the Commission functions and shall transmit to the Contracting States copies of that budget together with notices of their respective contributions as assessed under paragraph (3) or (4) of this Article.

1. The Commission shall establish a Regional Committee, with the powers and duties described in Article 6 of this Convention, for each of the regions into which the Convention area is divided.
2. The representation on any Regional Committee so established shall be determined by the Commission, provided, however, that any Contracting State with a coastline adjacent to that region, or exploiting the fisheries of the region, has automatically the right of representation on the Regional Committee. Contracting States exploiting elsewhere a stock which is also fished in that region shall have the opportunity of being represented on the Regional Committee.
3. Subject to the provisions of Article 6 of this Convention, the Commission shall determine the terms of reference of, and the procedure to be followed by, each Regional Committee.

Article 6
1. It shall be the duty of the Commission:
a) to keep under review the fisheries in the Convention area:
b) to consider, in the light of the technical information available, what measures may be required for the conservation of the fish stocks and for the rational exploitation of the fisheries in the area;
c) to consider, at the request of any Contracting State, representations made to it by a State which is not a party to this Convention for the opening of negotiations on the conservation of fish stocks in the Convention area or any part thereof; and

2. It shall be the duty of a Regional Committee to perform, in relation to its Region, functions of review and consideration similar to those described in paragraph (1) of this Article in relation to the Commission and the Convention area. A Regional Committee may initiate proposals for measures in relation to its region and shall consider any such proposals as may be remitted to it by the Commission.
3. A Regional Committee may prepare draft recommendations for consideration by the Commission, which may adopt any such draft recommendations, with any modifications it may consider desirable, as recommendations for the purpose of Article 7 of this Convention.

Article 10
At any time after two years from the date on which it has been required to give effect to any recommendation to which paragraph (1) of Article 8 of this Convention applies any Contracting State may give the Commission notice of the termination of its acceptance of the recommendation and, if that notice is not withdrawn, the recommendation shall cease to be binding on that Contracting State at the end of twelve months from the date of the notice.
