The Contracting Parties
RECALLING the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals opened for signature in Bonn on 23 June 1979;
RECOGNISING the unfavourable conservation status of bats in Europe and non-European Range States and in particular the serious threat to them from habitat degradation, disturbance of roosting sites and certain pesticides;
CONSCIOUS that the threats facing bats in Europe and non-European Range States are common to both migratory and non-migratory species and that roosts are often shared by migratory and non-migratory species;
RECALLING that the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals held in Bonn in October 1985 agreed to add European species of CHIROPTERA (Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae) to Appendix II of the Convention and instructed the Secretariat of the Convention to take appropriate measures to develop an Agreement for these species;
CONVINCED that the conclusion of an Agreement for these species would greatly benefit the conservation of bats in Europe;
Have agreed as follows:
