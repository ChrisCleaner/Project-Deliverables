CIRCULAR COMMUNICATION TO COMMISSIONERS AND CONTRACTING GOVERNMENTS (IWC.CCG.958)
Amendments to the Schedule, International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946
At the 63rd Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Jersey, Channel Islands, from 11-14 July 2011, no modifications were made to the provision for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons.
The following amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling are therefore necessary (changes in bold italics type):
Paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
- Substitute the dates 2010/2011 pelagic season and 2011 coastal season for 2011/12 pelagic season and 2012 coastal season as appropriate.
In accordance with Article V of the Convention, these amendments become effective with respect to each Contracting Government ninety days following the date of this letter, unless any Contracting Government lodges an objection, in which case the procedure under Article V, paragraph 3 of the Convention will be followed.
The ninety days period will expire on 25 October 2011. In the absence of objections by that date the amendments will become effective. Contracting Governments will be notified accordingly.
On 16 June 2011 the Czech Republic withdrew its objection to the Schedule amendments agreed at the Commission's 60th, 61st and 62nd Annual Meetings (see Circular Communication IWC.CCG.951). Accordingly the editorial footnote to Table 1 which recorded this objection has been removed.
Contracting Governments are reminded that Article V paragraph 3 of the Convention requires them to acknowledge receipt of this notification of amendments. In order to encourage compliance with this requirement, a form of acknowledgement is attached, to be completed and returned by post, fax or-email as is most convenient.
Simon Brockington
Secretary to the Commission
