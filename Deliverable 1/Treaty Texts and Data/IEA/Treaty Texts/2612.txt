Article 10
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, any contracting Government may grant to any of its nationals a special permit authorizing that national to kill, take and treat whales for purposes of scientific research subject to such restrictions as to number and subject to such other conditions as the contracting Government thinks fit, and the killing, taking and treating of whales in accordance with the terms in force under this Article shall be exempt from the operation of this Agreement.
Any contracting Government may at any time revoke a permit granted by it under this Article.
Article 11
The fullest possible use shall be made of all whales taken. Except in the case of whales or parts of whales intended for human food or for feeding animals, the oil shall be extracted by boiling or otherwise from all blubber, meat (except the meat of sperm whales) and bones other than the internal organs, whale bone and flippers, of all whales delivered to the factory ship or land station.
Article 12
There shall not at any time be taken for delivery to any factory ship or land station a greater number of whales than can be treated efficiently and in accordance with Article 11 of the present Agreement by the plant and personnel therein within a period of thirty-six hours from the time of the killing of each whale.
Article 13
Gunners and crews of factory ships, land stations and whale catchers shall be engaged on terms such that their remuneration shall depend to a considerable extent upon such factors as the species, size and yield of whales taken, and not merely upon the number of the whales taken, and no bonus or other remuneration, calculated by reference to the results of their work, shall be paid to the gunners and crews of whale catchers in respect of any whales the taking of which is forbidden by this Agreement.
Article 14
With a view to the enforcement of the preceding Article, each contracting Government shall obtain, in respect of every whale catcher under its jurisdiction, an account showing the total emolument of each gunner and member of the crew and the manner in which the emolument of each of them is calculated.
Article 15
Articles 5, 9, 13 and 14 of the present Agreement, in so far as they impose obligations not already in force, shall not until 1 December 1937, apply to factory ships, land stations or catchers attached thereto which are at present operating or which have already taken practical measures with a view to whaling operations during the period before the said date. In respect of such factory ships, land stations and whale catchers, the Agreement shall in any event come into force on the said date.
Article 16
The contracting Governments shall obtain with regard to all factory ships and land stations under their jurisdiction records of the number of whales of each species treated at each factory ship or land station and as to the aggregate amounts of oil of each grade and quantities of meal, guano and other products derived from them, together with particulars with respect to each whale treated in the factory ship or land station as to the date and place of taking, the species and sex of the whale, its length and, if it contains a foetus, the length and sex, if ascertainable of the foetus.

The contracting Governments shall, with regard to all whaling operations under their jurisdiction, communicate to the International Bureau for Whaling Statistics at Sandefjord in Norway the statistical information specified in Article 16 of the present Agreement together with any information which may be collected or obtained by them in regard to the calving grounds and migration routes of whales.
