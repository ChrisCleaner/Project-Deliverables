    ï»¿European Convention for the Protection of Animals for Slaughter
SRC: http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/102.htm
The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto,
Considering that it is desirable to ensure the protection of animals which are to be slaughtered;
Considering that slaughter methods which as far as possible spare animals suffering and pain should be uniformly applied in their countries;
Considering that fear, distress, suffering and pain inflicted on an animal during slaughter may affect the quality of the meat,
Have agreed as follows:
Chapter 1 - General principles
Article 1
1. This Convention shall apply to the movement, lairaging, restraint, stunning and slaughter of domestic solipeds, ruminants, pigs, rabbits and poultry.
2. For the purpose of this Convention: Slaughterhouse: shall mean any premises under health control, intended for the professional slaughter of animals to produce meat for consumption or for any other reason; Moving animals: shall mean unloading or driving them from unloading platforms or from stalls or pens at slaughterhouses to the premises or place where they are to be slaughtered; Lairaging: shall mean keeping animals in stalls, pens or covered areas at slaughterhouses in order to give them the necessary attention (water, fodder, rest) before they are slaughtered; Restraint: shall mean the application to an animal of any procedure in conformity with the provisions of this Convention designed to restrict its movements in order to facilitate stunning or slaughter; Stunning: shall mean any process in conformity with the provisions of this Convention, which when applied to an animal induces a state of insensibility which lasts until it is dead, thus sparing it in any event any avoidable suffering; Slaughter: shall mean causing the death of an animal after restraint, stunning and bleeding with the exceptions provided for in Chapter III of this Convention.
Article 2
1.Each Contracting Party shall take the necessary steps to ensure the implementation of the provisions of this Convention.
2. Nothing in this Convention shall, however, prevent Contracting Parties from adopting more stringent rules to protect animals.
3. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that the design, construction and facilities of slaughterhouses and their operation shall be such as to ensure that the appropriate conditions provided for in this Convention are complied with in order to spare animals any avoidable excitement, pain or suffering.
4. For slaughtering outside or inside slaughterhouses each Contracting Party shall ensure that the animals are spared any avoidable pain or suffering.
Chapter II - Delivery of animals to slaughterhouses and their lairaging until they are slaughtered
Article 3
1. Animals shall be unloaded as soon as possible. While waiting in the means of transport they shall be protected from extremes of weather and provided with adequate ventilation.
2. The personnel responsible for moving and lairaging such animals shall have the knowledge and skills required and shall comply with the requirements set out in this Convention.
Section I - The moving of animals within the precincts of slaughterhouses
Article 4
1. The animals shall be unloaded and moved with care.
2. Suitable equipment such as bridges, ramps, or gangways, shall be used for unloading animals. The equipment shall be constructed with flooring which will permit a proper foothold and, if necessary, shall be provided with lateral protection. Bridges, ramps and gangways shall have the minimum possible incline.
3. The animals shall not be frightened or excited. In any event care must be taken to ensure that animals are not overturned on bridges, ramps or gangways and that they cannot fall from them. In particular animals shall not be lifted by the head, feet or tail in a manner which will cause them pain or suffering.
4. When necessary, animals shall be led individually. Corridors along which they are moved must be so designed that they cannot injure themselves.
Article 5
1. When animals are moved their gregarious tendencies shall be exploited. Instruments shall be used solely to guide them and must only be used for short periods. In particular, they shall not be struck on, nor shall pressure be applied to, any particularly sensitive part of the body. Electric shocks may be used for bovine animals and pigs only, provided that the shocks last no more than two seconds, are adequately spaced out and the animals have room to move; such shocks shall be applied only to appropriate muscles.
2. Animals' tails shall not be crushed, twisted or broken and their eyes shall not be grasped. Blows and kicks shall not be inflicted.
3. Cages, baskets or crates in which animals are transported shall be handled with care. They shall not be thrown to the ground or knocked over.
4. Animals delivered in cages, baskets or crates with flexible or perforated bottoms shall be unloaded with particular care in order to avoid injuring the animals' extremities. Where appropriate they shall be unloaded individually.
Article 6
1. Animals shall not be taken to the place of slaughter unless they can be slaughtered immediately.
2. Animals which are not slaughtered immediately on arrival shall be lairaged.
Section II - Lairaging
Article 7
1. Animals shall be protected from unfavourable climatic conditions. Slaughterhouses shall be equipped with a sufficient number of stalls and pens for lairaging of the animals with protection from the effects of adverse weather.
2. The floor of areas where animals are unloaded, moved, kept waiting or temporarily based, shall not be slippery. It shall be such that it can be cleaned, disinfected and thoroughly drained of liquids.
3. Slaughterhouses shall have covered areas with feeding and drinking troughs and arrangements for tying up animals.
4. Animals which must spend the night at the slaughterhouse shall be so housed and, when appropriate, tied up in such a way that they may lie down.
5. Animals naturally hostile to each other on account of their species, sex, age or origin shall be separated from each other.
6. Animals which have been transported in cages, baskets or crates shall be slaughtered as soon as possible; otherwise they shall be watered and fed in accordance with the provisions of Article 8.
7. If animals have been subjected to high temperatures in humid weather, they shall be cooled.
8. Where climatic conditions make it necessary (e.g. high humidity, low temperatures), animals shall be placed in well-ventilated accommodation. During foddering the stalls shall be adequately lit.
Section III - Care
Article 8
1. Unless they are conducted as soon as possible to the place of slaughter, animals shall be offered water on arrival in the slaughterhouse.
2. With the exception of animals to be slaughtered within twelve hours of their arrival, they shall subsequently be given moderate quantities of food and water at appropriate intervals.
3. Where animals are not tied up, feeding receptacles shall be provided which will permit the animals to feed undisturbed.
Article 9
1. The condition and state of health of the animals shall be inspected at least every morning and evening.
2. Sick, weak or injured animals shall be slaughtered immediately. If this is not possible, they shall be separated in order to be slaughtered as soon as possible.
Section IV - Other provisions
Article 10
In respect of reindeer, each Contracting Party may authorise derogations from the provisions of Chapter II of this Convention.

Other slaughter operations than those mentioned in Article 1, paragraph 2 may commence only after the animal's death.
