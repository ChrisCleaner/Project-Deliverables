NOTING FURTHER resolution A.296 (VIII) by which the Assembly designated the Committee as the appropriate body referred to in articles I and III of the above-mentioned Protocol,
RECALLING resolution MEPC.49(31) by which the Committee adopted on 4 July 1991 an amended list to replace the original list annexed to the Protocol,
RECALLING FURTHER that it had approved, at its thirty-fifth session, the Criteria for the Selection of Substances for Inclusion in the Annex to the 1973 Intervention Protocol,
NOTING ALSO that the 1992 amendments to the IBC Code and Amendment 27 of the IMDG Code had entered into force,
HAVING CONSIDERED the proposed amendments to Appendix 2, noxious liquid substances carried in bulk, and Appendix 3, harmful substances carried in packaged form, prepared by the Secretariat in accordance with the above-mentioned criteria and taking into account the recent amendments to the IBC and IMDG Codes,
1. ADOPTS, by the required two-thirds majority of the Parties to the 1973 Intervention Protocol present and voting in the Committee, the amended list which appears in the Annex to this resolution;
2. REQUESTS the Secretary-General to communicate the amended List to all Parties to the 1973 Intervention Protocol in accordance with article III, paragraph 5, for acceptance, and to inform them that the amended to the list shall be deemed to have been accepted at the end of the period of six months after it has been communicated, unless with that period an objection to these amendments has been communicated to the Organization by not less than one third of the Parties, and that the amended list shall enter into force three months after it has been deemed to have been accepted; and
REQUESTS FURTHER the Secretary-General to annex copies thereof to the authentic text of the Protocol in accordance with article I, paragraph 2(a), once the amended list has been accepted in accordance with article III, paragraph 6, to replace the existing list.
