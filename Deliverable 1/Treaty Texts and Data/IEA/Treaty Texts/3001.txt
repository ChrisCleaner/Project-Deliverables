1. The following measures shall apply to salmon fishery operations conducted by Japanese nationals and fishing vessels in the waters of the Convention area:
(a) North of 56° North Latitude, between 180° Longitude and 175° West Longitude, and outside the areas designated as the United States exclusive economic zone by the Presidential Proclamation of March 10, 1983 (hereinafter referred to as "the United States exclusive economic zone"), beginning on June 26 (Japan Standard Time) (1500 June 25 GMT) of each year, the Japanese mothership fishery shall conduct salmon fishery operations according to the following schedule:
(1) For 1986, no more than 12 mothership fleet days in the area between 175° West Longitude and 180° Longitude;
(2) For 1987, no more than 8 mothership fleet days in the area between 178° West Longitude and 180° Longitude, with no salmon fishery operations to be conducted in the area east of 178° West Longitude; and
(3) For 1988 and thereafter, no salmon fishery operations are to be conducted in the area east of 180° Longitude.
(b) North of 56° North Latitude, west of 180° Longitude, and outside the United States exclusive economic zone, beginning on June 26 (Japan Standard Time) (1500 June 25 GMT) of each year, the Japanese mothership fishery shall conduct salmon fishery operations according to the following schedule:
(1) For 1986 through 1988, no more than 18 mothership fleet days each year;
(2) For 1989 through 1991, no more than 12 mothership fleet days each year;
(3) For 1992 and 1993, no more than 8 mothership fleet days each year; and
(4) For 1994 and thereafter, no salmon fishery operations are to be conducted.
(c) North of 46° North Latitude, between 175° East Longitude and 170° East Longitude, and outside and south of the United States exclusive economic zone, salmon fishery operations shall not begin before June 1 (Japan Standard Time) (1500 May 31 GMT) of each year.
(d) West of 175° East Longitude, and within the United States exclusive economic zone:
(1) For 1986 through 1993, salmon fishery operations shall not begin before June 10 (Japan Standard Time) (1500 June 9 GMT) of each year and shall end on July 31 (Japan Standard Time) (1500 July 31 GMT) of each year. Between these dates the Japanese mothership fishery shall conduct salmon fishery operations of no more than 140 mothership fleet days each year.
(2) For 1994 and thereafter, salmon fishery operations shall not begin before June 10 (Japan Standard Time) (1500 June 9 GMT) and shall end on July 26 (Japan Standard Time) (1500 July 26 GMT) of each year. Between these dates the Japanese mothership fishery shall conduct salmon fishery operations of no more than 144 mothership fleet days each year.
(3) Fishing vessels engaged in this fishery shall be required to have on board a registration permit which shall be issued by the Government of the United States. Such vessels may be required by the Government of the United States to accept on board scientific observers and to bear the expenses incurred in such boarding. Such vessels shall also be required to have on board a Certificate of Inclusion relating to the incidental taking of marine mammals which is a requirement of the Government of the United States.
(e) Except for the areas specified in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above, in the area north of 46° North Latitude there shall be no salmon fishery operations east of 175° East Longitude, unless such fishery operations are agreed to for a temporary period among the three Contracting Parties.
(f) In 1986 and thereafter, the Japanese landbased fishery shall not conduct salmon fishery operations east of 174° East Longitude. The eastern limit of this fishery may be modified in accordance with the results of the coordinated scientific studies to be initiated with the beginning of the 1986 season in the landbased fishery area south of 46° North Latitude to determine accurately continent of origin of salmonids migrating in this area, including biological sampling and studies and verification of fishing effort and catch by species, date, and location. The modification shall be negotiated no later than the beginning of the 1991 season.
2. For the purposes of this Annex, a mothership fleet day is defined as one mothership with forty-three catcher/scout boats using 14,190 tans (330 tans/15km) of fishing nets during a portion of any one calendar day. Any increase in the number of catcher/scout boats assigned to the mothership fishery will be reflected in a proportional reduction in the number of authorized fleet days. Modifications to gear or fishing procedures which might affect current fishing efficiency, or modifications to areas which are different from those used in 1985, shall be undertaken only after consultations among the three Contracting Parties. In such consultations the Contracting Parties shall examine the necessity of change in the number of authorized fleet days to take account of any increase in fishing efficiency.
3. East of 170° East Longitude the southern limit of the Japanese mothership fishery and the northern limit of the Japanese landbased fishery shall remain at 46° North Latitude. West of 170° East Longitude the southern limit of the Japanese mothership fishery shall not extend south of 46° North Latitude, and the northern limit of the Japanese landbased fishery shall not extend north of 48° North Latitude.
