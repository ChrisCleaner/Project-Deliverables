.2 that ship is constructed on or after:
.1 1 January 2016 and is operating in the North American Emission Control Area or the United States Caribbean Sea Emission Control Area;
.2 1 January 2021 and is operating in the Baltic Sea Emission Control Area or the North Sea Emission Control Area;
3 Between paragraph 5.1.2 and 5.1.3 the word "when" is deleted.
4 In paragraph 5.1.3 the words "an emission control area designated for Tier III NOX control under paragraph 6 of this regulation" are replaced by "a NOX Tier III emission control area".

.1 for a newly constructed ship, the period beginning at the time the ship is delivered from the shipyard, including sea trials, and ending at the time the ship directly exits the NOX Tier III emission control area(s) or, with regard to a ship fitted with a dual fuel engine, the ship directly exits the NOX Tier III emission control area(s) or proceeds directly to the nearest gas fuel bunkering facility appropriate to the ship located in the NOX Tier III emission control area(s);
.2 for a ship with a Tier II engine undergoing conversion, maintenance or repair, the period beginning at the time the ship enters the NOX Tier III emission control area(s) and proceeds directly to the shipyard or other repair facility, and ending at the time the ship is released from the shipyard or other repair facility and directly exits the NOX Tier III emission control area (s) after performing sea trials, if applicable; or
.3 for a ship with a dual fuel engine undergoing conversion, maintenance or repair, when the ship is required to not have gas fuel or gas cargo on board due to safety requirements, the period beginning at the time the ship enters the NOX Tier III emission control area(s) or when it is degassed in the NOX Tier III emission control area(s) and proceeds directly to the shipyard or other repair facility, and ending at the time when the ship is released from the shipyard or other repair facility and directly exits the NOX Tier III emission control area(s) or proceeds directly to the nearest gas fuel bunkering facility appropriate to the ship located in the NOX Tier III emission control area(s)."
7 The existing text of paragraph 6 is replaced by the following:
"6 For the purposes of this regulation, a NOX Tier III emission control area shall be any sea area, including any port area, designated by the Organization in accordance with the criteria and procedures set forth in appendix III to this Annex. The NOX Tier III emission control areas are:
.1 the North American Emission Control Area, which means the area described by the coordinates provided in appendix VII to this Annex;
