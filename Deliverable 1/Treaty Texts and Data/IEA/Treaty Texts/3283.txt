    ﻿Amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling of 2 December 1946
Source: Select Documents on International Affairs No. 46 (1998) 14. page 141:
At the 50th Annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman, 16-20 May 1998, no modifications were made to the provision for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons. The following amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling are therefore necessary (changes in bold type):
Paragraphs 11 and 12 and Tables 1, 2 and 3
Substitute the dates 1998/99 pelagic season, 1999 coastal season, 1999 season, or 1999 as appropriate.
These amendments become effective with respect to each Contracting Government ninety days following the date of this letter, in accordance with Article V of the Convention, unless any Contracting Government lodges an objection, in which case the procedure under Article V, paragraph 3 of the Convention will be followed.
The ninety days period will expire on 1 September 1998. In the absence of objections by that date the amendments will become effective. Contracting Governments will be notified accordingly.
