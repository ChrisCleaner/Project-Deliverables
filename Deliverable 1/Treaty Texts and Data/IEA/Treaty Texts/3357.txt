The operator and each member of the crew shall facilitate and assist in any action by an authorised officer of a Pacific Island party and shall not assault, obstruct, resist, delay, refuse boarding to, intimidate or interfere with an authorised officer in the performance of his or her duties.
17. The operator shall ensure that a recent and up-to-date copy of the International Code of Signals (INTERCO) is on board and accessible at all times.
18. The international distress frequency, 2.182 MHz, and 156.8 MHz (Channel 16, VHF) shall be monitored continuously from the vessel for the purpose of facilitating communication with the fisheries management, surveillance and enforcement authorities of the parties.
19. The operator shall comply with the 1989 FAO standard specifications for the marking and identification of fishing vessels. In particular the international radio call sign of the vessel shall be painted in white on a black background, or in black on a white background in the following manner:
(a) on the vessel's hull or superstructure, with each letter and number being at least one metre high and having a stroke width of 16.7 centimetres, with the background extending to provide a border around the mark of not less than 16.7 centimetres;
(b) on the vessel's deck, on the body of any helicopter and on the hull of any skiff, with each letter and number being at least 30 centimetres high, and having a stroke width of 5 centimetres wide with the background extending to provide a border around the mark of not less than 5 centimetres; and
(c) on any other equipment being carried by and intended to be separated from the vessel during normal fishing operations, with each letter and
number being at least 10 centimetres high and having a stroke width of 1.7 centimetres, with the background extending to provide a border around the mark of not less than 1.7 centimetres;
and at all times while the vessel is within the Licensing Area or a Closed Area, all parts of these markings shall be clear, distinct and uncovered.
20. The licence or a duly certified copy, facsimile or telex confirmation thereof shall be carried on board the vessel at all times and produced at the request of an authorised enforcement official of any of the parties. Prior to receipt of the licence, the correct citation of the licence number shall satisfy this requirement.
PART 7
OBSERVERS
21. The operator and each member of the crew of the vessel shall allow and assist any person identified as an observer by the Pacific Island parties to:
(a) board the vessel for scientific, compliance, monitoring and other functions at the point and time notified by the Pacific Island parties to the Government of the United States;
(b) have full access to and the use of facilities and equipment on board the vessel which the observer may determine is necessary to carry out his or her duties; including full access to the bridge, fish on board and areas which may be used to hold, process, weigh and store fish; remove samples; have full access to the vessel's records, including its logs and documentation for the purpose of inspection and copying; reasonable access to navigation equipment, charts, and radios; and gather any other information relating to fisheries in the Licensing Area; without interfering unduly with the lawful operation of the vessel;
(c) disembark at the point and time notified by the Pacific Island parties to the Government of the United States; and
(d) carry out all duties safely,
and no operator or crew member of the vessel shall assault, obstruct, resist, delay, refuse boarding to, intimidate or interfere with an observer in the performance of his or her duties.
22. The operator shall provide the observer, while on board the vessel, at no expense to the Pacific Island parties, with food, accommodation and medical facilities of such reasonable standard as may be acceptable to the Pacific Island party whose representative is serving as the observer.
23. (a) The operators of United States vessels licensed to fish pursuant to the agreement shall
be responsible for the costs of observers on United States vessels including the full travel costs from the place notified by the Pacific Island parties to and from the vessel, salary and allowances, and full insurance coverage, and the cost of training those observers.
(b) The fees for the costs of the observers shall be provided in a lump sum on an annual basis from 15 June 2003 in accordance with the following formula:
The fixed cost component of US$55,000 plus the number of vessels licensed multiplied by 5 trips multiplied by 20 percent multiplied by the cost per trip (US$4,500) equals lump sum payment. The fixed cost component shall consist of the costs to the Administrator for training and management of the Observer and Crewing Programme.
(c) The Parties may, as mutually determined at the annual meeting provided for in Article 7.1 of the Treaty adjust the amount of the fees to be paid under sub-paragraph (b), it being understood that:
- the goal of the observer programme is to provide an effective observer programme for compliance by targeting 20 percent coverage, which may be reviewed from time to time;
- any unused sums are carried forward to the next licensing period; and
- the factor of inflation shall be taken into account.
24. Any operator of the vessel from which any fish taken in the Licensing Area is unloaded shall allow, or arrange for, and assist any person authorised for this purpose by the Pacific Island parties to have full access to any place where such fish is unloaded, to remove samples and to gather any other information relating to fisheries in the Licensing Area.
25. An observer programme shall be conducted in accordance with this Treaty and provisions that may be agreed from time to time.
PART 8
MISCELLANEOUS REQUIREMENTS
26. At all times while the vessel is in a Closed Area, the fishing gear of the vessel shall be stowed in such a manner as not to be readily available for fishing. In particular, the boom shall be lowered as far as possible so that the vessel cannot be used for fishing but so that the skiff is accessible for use in emergency situations; the helicopter, if any, shall be tied down; and launches shall be secured.
27. The vessel shall be operated in such a way that the activities of traditional and locally based fishermen and fishing vessels are not disrupted or in any other way adversely affected.
28. Any information required to be recorded, or to be notified, communicated or reported pursuant to a requirement of this Treaty shall be true, complete and correct. Any change in circumstances which has the effect of rendering any such information false, incomplete or misleading shall be notified to the Administrator immediately.
29. The vessel shall have its automatic locations communicator (ALC), as approved by the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), operational at all times while in the Treaty Area. Data collected through the vessel's ALC shall be transmitted in near real time both to the FFA and to the Government of the United States. While the vessel is in waters within the Treaty Area that are under the jurisdiction of the Government of the United States, viewing of the data transmitted shall be limited to the Government of the United States. All data transmitted in accordance with this provision shall be treated as confidential business information and shall be distributed only to ensure that the obligations under this Treaty are fulfilled. Technical matters including financial implications related to the implementation of this Part will be a matter for discussion between the parties.

ANNEX II
1. For the purposes of this Annex:
(a) "Licensing Period" means the period of validity of licences issued in accordance with this Treaty.
2. The Government of the United States shall make application for a licence in respect of any fishing vessel of the United States intended by the operator to be used for purse seine fishing in the Licensing Area at any time in the Licensing Period by providing to the Administrator a complete application form as set out in Schedule 1.
3. Licences issued pursuant to this Treaty shall not take effect until the Administrator has received payment, free of any charges whatsoever, of the amounts set out in Schedule 2 for that Licensing Period in the manner described in that Schedule.
4. (a) The Administrator may suspend the good standing of a vessel on the Regional Register of Foreign Fishing Vessels where there is reasonable cause to believe that the vessel operator has violated the terms and conditions of access in Annex I including but not limited to:
(i) failing to report entry into and exit from Zones;
(ii) failing to report while in a Zone;
(iii) misreporting position and catch on board; or
(iv) improperly marking the vessel and gear.
(b) The Administrator shall notify the Government of the United States and the operator not less than 30 days prior to the intended date of suspension of good standing. The notice shall include a statement of the facts which give reasonable cause to believe a violation has occurred, the corrective action required, and the effective date of the suspension of good standing; provided however that the corrective action required shall be limited to making the omitted report, correcting any misreporting, or correcting vessel markings or otherwise complying with the requirements of Annex I.
(c) If the corrective action is taken within 30 days, the Administrator shall not suspend good standing.
(d) Upon satisfactory completion of the required corrective action, the Administrator shall immediately reinstate the good standing of the vessel.
(e) Any fishing vessel of the United States in respect of which good standing has been suspended shall not be eligible to receive a new licence upon the expiration of the current licence, until notified by the Administrator that good standing has been reinstated.
5. Subject to paragraph 6, a licence may be denied:
(a) where the application is not in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2;
(b) where the owner or charterer is the subject of proceedings under the bankruptcy laws of the United States, unless reasonable financial assurances have been provided to the Administrator;
(c) where the vessel in respect of which application for a licence has been made does not have good standing on the Regional Register of Foreign Fishing Vessels, maintained by the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency, provided that:
(i) good standing is withdrawn only as a result of:
(A) the commission of a serious offence against fisheries laws or regulations of a Pacific Island State and the operator has not fully complied with any civil or criminal judgment rendered with respect to such an offence;
(B) evidence existing that gives reasonable cause to believe that the operator has committed a serious offence against the fisheries laws or regulations of any Pacific Island State and that it has not been possible to bring the vessel operator to trial;
(C) the vessel operator has failed to comply with the annual registration and information requirements for registration as notified by the Administrator to the Government of the United States; or
(D) the failure to satisfactorily complete the required corrective action of all outstanding requests, as a result of which the good standing of a vessel has continued in suspension for a period of more than 12 months;
(ii) the Pacific Island party requesting withdrawal of good standing has first consulted the Government of the United States and has made all reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute in question before utilising the procedures for withdrawal of good standing;
(iii) in the event of a request for withdrawal of good standing from the Regional Register of Foreign Fishing Vessels of a vessel licensed pursuant to this Treaty, the Pacific Island parties agree to take into consideration that vessel's compliance with the terms of this Treaty in determining whether to approve such a request; and
(iv) following a withdrawal of good standing the Pacific Island party involved promptly advises the Government of the United States in writing of the reason for the withdrawal and the requirements which must be fulfilled to reinstate good standing;
(d) where there has been a failure to satisfy a final judgment or other final determination for a breach of this Treaty by the owner, charterer or master of the vessel in respect of which application for a licence has been made, until such time as the final judgment or other final determination is satisfied, and subsequent change in ownership of a vessel shall not affect the application of this provision; or
(e) where an operator has committed, or the vessel has been used for:
(i) a violation of this Treaty, providing that the Pacific Island parties, following consultation with the Government of the United States, determine that the violation is of a serious nature; or
(ii) any violation of this Treaty on more than one occasion, providing that the Pacific Island parties, following consultation with the Government of the United States, determine that such multiple violations constitute a serious disregard of this Treaty.
6. Without prejudice to their rights under paragraph 4 of Article 4 of the Treaty, the Pacific Island parties shall consider notifying the Government of the United States of any alleged infringements of the Treaty by vessels of the United States 30 days prior to requesting an investigation under paragraph 4 of Article 4 of the Treaty. The Government of the United States shall inquire into the allegation. As appropriate, the Government of the United States, the operator concerned, the Administrator and the Pacific Island party concerned may engage in consultations with a view to settling the matter.
7. A maximum number of licences may be issued for any Licensing Period as set out in Schedule 2, and, upon request by the Government of the United States, the Pacific Island parties may agree to vary such number.
8. On receipt of an application for a licence in accordance with this Annex, the Administrator shall take the necessary steps to ensure that:
(a) a licence in the form set out in Schedule 3 in respect of the vessel identified in the application; or
(b) a statement setting out the reasons that a licence in respect of the vessel identified in the application is denied together with a refund of the amount or amounts provided with the application;

SCHEDULE 2
PAYMENTS AND REVIEW
1. The following amounts are payable annually for a period of ten (10) years from 15 June 2003 pursuant to paragraph 3 of Annex II -
(a) an annual industry payment of US$3 million, which shall cover -
(i) licence fees for up to 45 vessels as set forth in paragraph 2 below; and
(ii) technical assistance;
(b) costs to be paid by the industry for the observer programme set forth in Part 7 of Annex I; and
(c) sums pursuant to the related agreement between the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency and the Government of the United States.
2. The United States industry payment specified in paragraph 1(a) of this Schedule may be made in two separate instalments. One half of the payments shall be paid by June 15 each year with the balance to be paid by December 15th of the same year. The second instalment will be paid with interest at an agreed rate.
3. In order to increase the benefits to the Pacific Island parties under the Treaty, the United States industry will develop with the Pacific Island parties a system for revenue sharing where the ex-vessel price is at or above a mutually agreed level. Payments made under such a system will be made quarterly and will be in addition to the amount specified in paragraph 1(a).
4. During each licensing period, the Administrator shall make available a maximum of 45 licences to fishing vessels of the United States for fishing in the Licensing Area. Any licences issued beyond 40 shall only be available to fishing vessels of the United States engaged in fishing activity designed to advance broader cooperation with the Pacific Island parties as envisaged under Article 2. If the Administrator does not receive applications for the maximum of 45 licences during any of the first three licensing periods under this Schedule, the Pacific Island parties reserve the right at the end of the third licensing period to review the allocation of licences beyond 40 for the remaining licensing periods.
5. Prior to the beginning of the sixth licensing period under this Schedule, the parties shall review the number of licenses to be issued, the license fees, the potential impact of any existing or pending catch or effort limitations or other measures that may substantially affect the operations of the U.S. fleet and any other issues which may be identified during the preceding Annual Consultation. During such review, the parties shall determine the number of licenses and the license fees for the second five-year period under this Schedule. Any agreed changes in the number of licenses or license fees shall be reflected in the annual industry payment.
