RECALLING that the International Conference on Tanker Safety and Pollution Prevention, 1978, by resolution 10, recommended that IMO take the necessary action to amend the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (the 1974 SOLAS Convention), the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the 1978 Protocol relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78), and the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966 (the 1966 Load Line Convention), with a view to standardizing the periods of validity of the certificates as well as the intervals of surveys required by these Conventions,
