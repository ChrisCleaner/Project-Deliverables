Recognizing that grave pollution of the sea by oil in the North Sea area involves a danger to the coastal states,
Noting that the Council of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization at its third extraordinary session in May 1967, decided to include among the matters requiring study as a matter of urgency, inter alia, "procedures whereby States, regionally or interregionally where applicable, can co-operate at short notice to provide manpower, supplies, equipment and scientific advice to deal with discharge of oil or other noxious or hazardous substances including consideration of the possibility of patrols to ascertain the extent of the discharge and the manner of treating it both on sea and land",

b) the competent authority responsible for receiving reports of oil pollution and for dealing with questions concerning measures of mutual assistance between Contracting Parties;
c) new ways in which oil pollution may be avoided and about new effective measures to deal with oil pollution.
Article 5
1. Whenever a Contracting Party is aware of a casualty or the presence of oil slicks in the North Sea area likely to constitute a serious threat to the coast or related interests of any other Contracting Party, it shall inform that other Party without delay through its competent authority.
2. The Contracting Parties undertake to request the masters of all ships flying their flags and pilots of aircraft registered in their countries to report without delay through the channels which may be most practicable and adequate in the circumstances:
a) all casualties causing or likely to cause oil pollution of the sea;
b) the presence, nature and extent of oil slicks on the sea likely to constitute a serious threat to the coast or related interests of one or more Contracting Parties.
Article 6
1. For the sole purposes of this Agreement the North Sea area is divided into the zones described in the Annex to this Agreement.
2.

These arrangements shall be communicated to the other Contracting Parties.
5. In no case shall the division into zones referred to in this Article be invoked as a precedent or argument in any matter concerning sovereignty of jurisdiction.
Article 7
A Contracting Party requiring assistance to dispose of oil floating on the sea or polluting its coast may call on the help of the other Contracting Parties, starting with those which also seem likely to be affected by the floating oil. Contracting Parties called upon for help in accordance with this Article shall use their best endeavours to bring such assistance as is within their power.
