AMENDMENTS TO THE SCHEDULE
At its 46th Annual Meeting held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, 23-27 May 1994, the International Whaling Commission adopted the following amendments to the Schedule (changes in bold type):
1. Designate existing paragraph 7 as subparagraph 7(a), and add the following sub-paragraph:
(b) In accordance with Article V(1)(c) of the Convention, commercial whaling, whether by pelagic operations or from land stations, is prohibited in a region designated as the Southern Ocean Sanctuary. This Sanctuary comprises the waters of the Southern Hemisphere southwards of the following line: starting from 40 degrees S, 50 degrees W; thence due east to 20 degrees E; thence due south to 55 degrees S; thence due east to 130 degrees E; thence due north to 40 degrees S; thence due east to 130 degrees W; thence due south to 60 degrees S; thence due east to 50 degrees W; thence due north to the point of beginning. This prohibition applies irrespective of the conservation status of baleen and toothed whale stocks in this Sanctuary, as may from time to time be determined by the Commission. However, this prohibition shall be reviewed ten years after its initial adoption and at succeeding ten year intervals, and could be revised at such times by the Commission. Nothing in this sub-paragraph is intended to prejudice the special legal and political status of Antarctica.
2. Amend subparagraph 13(b)(1)(i) to read:
(i)For the years 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, the number of bowhead whales landed shall not exceed 204, and the number of bowhead whales struck shall not exceed 68 in 1995, 67 in 1996, 66 in 1997, and 65 in 1998, except that any unused portion of the strike quota for each year shall be carried forward from that year and added to the strike quota of any subsequent years, provided that no more than 10 strikes shall be added to the strike quota for any one year.
3. Amend paragraph 13(b)(2)(i) to read:
(i)The number of gray whales taken in accordance with this sub-paragraph in each of the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 shall not exceed the limit shown in Table 1. 4. Amend Table 1 for the North Pacific Eastern Stock of gray whales so that the catch limit is 140 with the same footnote.
5. Amend Table 1 so that for West Greenland fin whales:
the number in Table 1 is changed to 19, with a footnote 2) reading:
2Available to be taken by aborigines pursuant to paragraph 13(b)3. Catch limit for each of the years 1995, 1996 and 1997. 6. Amend Table 1 so that the North Atlantic central stock of minke whales has a footnote 2) which reads as above.
7. Amend paragraph 13(b)3(ii) to read:
(ii) For each of the years 1995, 1996 and 1997, the number of minke whales struck from the West Greenland stock shall not exceed 165, and the total number of whales struck shall not exceed 465 in these three years.
8. Revise paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
by substitution of the dates 1994/95 pelagic season, 1995 coastal season, 1995 season, or 1995 as appropriate.
