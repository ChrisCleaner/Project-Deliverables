The Meeting,
Recalling its decision II/10 on the review of the Convention and paragraph 19 of the Sofia Ministerial Declaration,
Wishing to modify the Convention with a view to further strengthening its application and improving synergies with other multilateral environmental agreements,
Commending the work done by the task force established at the second meeting of Parties, by the small group on amendments and by the Working Group on Environmental Impact Assessment itself,
Noting the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, done at Aarhus, Denmark, on 25 June 1998, and recalling the Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment, done at Kiev, Ukraine, on 21 May 2003,
Also noting relevant European Community legal instruments, such as directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, as amended by directives 97/11/EC and 2003/35/EC,
Conscious that an extension of Appendix I will strengthen the importance of environmental impact assessments in the region,
Recognizing the benefits of international cooperation as early as possible in the assessment of environmental impact,
Encouraging the work of the Implementation Committee as a useful tool for the further implementation and application of the provisions of the Convention,
1. Confirms that the validity of decisions taken prior to the entry into force of the second amendment to the Convention, including the adoption of protocols, the establishment of subsidiary bodies, the review of compliance and actions taken by the Implementation Committee, are not affected by the adoption and entry into force of this amendment;
2. Also confirms that each Party shall continue to be eligible to participate in all activities under the Convention, including the preparation of protocols, the establishment and participation in subsidiary bodies, and the review of compliance, regardless of whether the second amendment to the Convention has entered into force for that Party or not;
3. Adopts the following amendments to the Convention:
(a) In Article 2, after paragraph 10, insert a new paragraph reading
11. If the Party of origin intends to carry out a procedure for the purposes of determining the content of the environmental impact assessment documentation, the affected Party should to the extent appropriate be given the opportunity to participate in this procedure.
(b) In Article 8, after Convention insert
and under any of its protocols to which they are a Party
(c) In Article 11, replace paragraph 2 (c) by a new subparagraph reading

Article 14 bis
Review of compliance
1. The Parties shall review compliance with the provisions of this Convention on the basis of the compliance procedure, as a non-adversarial and assistance-oriented procedure adopted by the Meeting of the Parties. The review shall be based on, but not limited to, regular reporting by the Parties. The Meeting of Parties shall decide on the frequency of regular reporting required by the Parties and the information to be included in those regular reports.
2. The compliance procedure shall be available for application to any protocol adopted under this Convention.
(g) Replace Appendix I to the Convention by the Appendix to this decision;
(h) In Appendix VI, after paragraph 2, insert a new paragraph reading
3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 may be applied, mutatis mutandis, to any protocol to the Convention.
