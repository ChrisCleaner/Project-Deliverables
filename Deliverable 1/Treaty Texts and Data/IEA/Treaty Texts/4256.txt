At the 55th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Berlin from 16-19 June 2003, no modifications were made to the provision for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons. The following amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling are therefore necessary (changes in bold type):
Paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
Substitute the dates 2003/2004 pelagic season, 2004 coastal season, 2004 season, or 2004 as appropriate.
In accordance with Article V of the Convention, these amendments become effective with respect to each Contracting Government ninety days following the date of this letter, unless any Contracting Government lodges an objection, in which case the procedure under Article V, paragraph 3 of the Convention will be followed. 
The ninety days period will expire on 30 September 2003. In the absence of objections by that date the amendments will become effective. 
Contracting Governments will be notified accordingly. Contracting Governments are reminded that Article V paragraph 3 of the Convention requires them to acknowledge receipt of this notification of amendments. In order to encourage compliance with this requirement, a form of acknowledgement is attached, to be completed and returned by post, fax or-email as is most convenient.

Secretary to the Commission
