The Contracting Parties to this Protocol,
Being Parties to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region, done at Cartagena de Indias, Colombia on 24 March 1983,
Taking into account Article 10 of the Convention which requires the establishment of specially protected areas,
Having regard to the special hydrographic, biotic and ecological characteristics of the Wider Caribbean Region,
Conscious of the grave threat posed by ill-conceived development options to the integrity of the marine and coastal environment of the Wider Caribbean Region,
Recognizing that protection and maintenance of the environment of the Wider Caribbean Region are essential to sustainable development within the region,
Conscious of the overwhelming ecological, economic, aesthetic, scientific, cultural, nutritional and recreational value of rare or fragile ecosystems and native flora and fauna to the Wider Caribbean Region,
Recognizing that the Wider Caribbean Region constitutes an interconnected group of ecosystems in which an environmental threat in one part represents a potential threat in other parts,
Stressing the importance of establishing regional co-operation to protect and, as appropriate, to restore and improve the state of ecosystems, as well as threatened and endangered species and their habitats in the Wider Caribbean Region by, among other means, the establishment of protected areas in the marine areas and their associated ecosystems,
Recognizing that the establishment and management of such protected areas, and the protection of threatened and endangered species will enhance the cultural heritage and values of the countries and territories in the Wider Caribbean Region, and bring increased economic and ecological benefits to them,
Have agreed as follows:
