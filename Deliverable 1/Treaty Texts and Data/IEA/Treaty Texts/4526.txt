The Contracting Parties to the present Protocol,
Being Parties to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, adopted at Barcelona on 16 February 1976, and amended on 10 June 1995,
Desirous of implementing the obligations set out in Article 4, paragraphs 3(e) and 5, of the said Convention,
Considering that the coastal zones of the Mediterranean Sea are the common natural and cultural heritage of the peoples of the Mediterranean and that they should be preserved and used judiciously for the benefit of present and future generations,
Concerned at the increase in anthropic pressure on the coastal zones of the Mediterranean Sea which is threatening their fragile nature and desirous of halting and reversing the process of coastal zone degradation and of significantly reducing the loss of biodiversity of coastal ecosystems,
Worried by the risks threatening coastal zones due to climate change, which is likely to result, inter alia, in a rise in sea level, and aware of the need to adopt sustainable measures to reduce the negative impact of natural phenomena,
Convinced that, as an irreplaceable ecological, economic and social resource, the planning and management of coastal zones with a view to their preservation and sustainable development requires a specific integrated approach at the level of the Mediterranean basin as a whole and of its coastal States, taking into account their diversity and in particular the specific needs of islands related to geomorphological characteristics.
Taking into account the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, done at Montego Bay on 10 December 1982, the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat, done at Ramsar on 2 February 1971, and the Convention on Biological Diversity, done at Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992, to which many Mediterranean coastal States and the European Community are Parties,
Concerned in particular to act in cooperation for the development of appropriate and integrated plans for coastal zone management pursuant to Article 4, paragraph 1(e), of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York on 9 May 1992,
Drawing on existing experience with integrated coastal zone management and the work of various organizations, including the European institutions,
Based upon the recommendations and work of the Mediterranean Commission on Sustainable Development and the recommendations of the Meetings of the Contracting Parties held in Tunis in 1997, Monaco in 2001, Catania in 2003, and Portoroz in 2005, and the Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development adopted in Portoroz in 2005,
Resolved to strengthen at the Mediterranean level the efforts made by coastal States to ensure integrated coastal zone management,
Determined to stimulate national, regional and local initiatives through coordinated promotional action, cooperation and partnership with the various actors concerned with a view to promoting efficient governance for the purpose of integrated coastal zone management,
Desirous of ensuring that coherence is achieved with regard to integrated coastal zone management in the application of the Convention and its Protocols,
Have agreed as follows:

Article 6
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INTEGRATED COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT
In implementing this Protocol, the Parties shall be guided by the following principles of integrated coastal zone management:

(b) All elements relating to hydrological, geomorphological, climatic, ecological, socio-economic and cultural systems shall be taken into account in an integrated manner, so as not to exceed the carrying capacity of the coastal zone and to prevent the negative effects of natural disasters and of development.
(c) The ecosystems approach to coastal planning and management shall be applied so as to ensure the sustainable development of coastal zones.
(d) Appropriate governance allowing adequate and timely participation in a transparent decision-making process by local populations and stakeholders in civil society concerned with coastal zones shall be ensured.
(e) Cross-sectorally organized institutional coordination of the various administrative services and regional and local authorities competent in coastal zones shall be required.
(f) The formulation of land use strategies, plans and programmes covering urban development and socio-economic activities, as well as other relevant sectoral policies, shall be required.
(g) The multiplicity and diversity of activities in coastal zones shall be taken into account, and priority shall be given, where necessary, to public services and activities requiring, in terms of use and location, the immediate proximity of the sea.
(h) The allocation of uses throughout the entire coastal zone should be balanced, and unnecessary concentration and urban sprawl should be avoided.
(i) Preliminary assessments shall be made of the risks associated with the various human activities and infrastructure so as to prevent and reduce their negative impact on coastal zones.
(j) Damage to the coastal environment shall be prevented and, where it occurs, appropriate restoration shall be effected.
Article 7
COORDINATION
1. For the purposes of integrated coastal zone management, the Parties shall:
(a) ensure institutional coordination, where necessary through appropriate bodies or mechanisms, in order to avoid sectoral approaches and facilitate comprehensive approaches;
(b) organize appropriate coordination between the various authorities competent for both the marine and the land parts of coastal zones in the different administrative services, at the national, regional and local levels;
