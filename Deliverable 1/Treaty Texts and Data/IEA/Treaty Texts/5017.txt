The 65th Meeting of the International Whaling Commission was held in Portoroz Slovenia, from 15-18 September 2014 with 64 Contracting Governments in attendance.
During the meeting the Commission adopted a proposal to amend Schedule paragraph 13(b) (3) in respect of catch limits for Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling around Greenland for the years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. 
Additionally at the 65th meeting, no modifications were made to the provision for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons.
The following amendments to the Schedule are therefore necessary:
Paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
- Substitute the dates 2012/2013 pelagic season and 2013 coastal season for 2014/15 pelagic season and 2015 coastal season as appropriate.
- Update of fin whale catch number for West Greenland Stock in Table 1 and adjustment of the years referred by footnote 2.
Paragraph 13(b) (3)
- Changes to catch numbers and years referred.
- Removal of two editorial footnotes
A complete copy of the revised Schedule is included with this communication with adjustments highlighted in bold italic and removed footnotes in strike-through text.
In accordance with Article V of the Convention, these amendments become effective with respect to each Contracting Government ninety days following the date of this letter, unless any Contracting Government lodges an objection, in which case the procedure under Article V, paragraph 3 ofthe Convention will be followed.
The ninety days period will expire on 4 January 2015 [Ed: See Czech Republic objection below]. In the absence of objections by that date the amendments will become effective. Contracting Governments Will be notified accordingly.
Contracting Governments are reminded that Article V paragraph 3 of the Convention requires them to acknowledge receipt of this notification of amendments.
