Regulation 21
Required EEDI
1 For each:
.1 new ship;
.2 new ship which has undergone a major conversion; and
.3 new or existing ship which has undergone a major conversion that is so extensive that the ship is regarded by the Administration as a newly constructed ship
which falls into one of the categories defined in regulation 2.25 to 2.31 and to which this chapter is applicable, the attained EEDI shall be as follows:
Attained EEDI ≦ Required EEDI = (1-X/100) × Reference line value
where X is the reduction factor specified in Table 1 for the required EEDI compared to the EEDI Reference line.
2 For each new and existing ship that has undergone a major conversion which is so extensive that the ship is regarded by the Administration as a newly constructed ship, the attained EEDI shall be calculated and meet the requirement of paragraph 21.1 with the reduction factor applicable corresponding to the ship type and size of the converted ship at the date of the contract of the conversion, or in the absence of a contract, the commencement date of the conversion.
Table 1. Reduction factors (in percentage) for the EEDI relative to the EEDI Reference line
* Reduction factor to be linearly interpolated between the two values dependent upon vessel size. The lower value of the reduction factor is to be applied to the smaller ship size.
n/a means that no required EEDI applies.
3 The Reference line values shall be calculated as follows:
Reference line value = a ×b -c
where a, b and c are the parameters given in Table 2.
Table 2. Parameters for determination of reference values for the different ship types
4 If the design of a ship allows it to fall into more than one of the above ship type definitions, the required EEDI for the ship shall be the most stringent (the lowest) required EEDI.
5 For each ship to which this regulation applies, the installed propulsion power shall not be less than the propulsion power needed to maintain the manoeuvrability of the ship under adverse conditions as defined in the guidelines to be developed by the Organization.
6 At the beginning of Phase 1 and at the midpoint of Phase 2, the Organization shall review the status of technological developments and, if proven necessary, amend the time periods, the EEDI reference line parameters for relevant ship types and reduction rates set out in this regulation.
Regulation 22
Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP)
1 Each ship shall keep on board a ship specific Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP). This may form part of the ship's Safety Management System (SMS).
2 The SEEMP shall be developed taking into account guidelines adopted by the Organization.
Regulation 23
Promotion of technical co-operation and transfer of technology relating to the improvement of energy efficiency of ships
1 Administrations shall, in co-operation with the Organization and other international bodies, promote and provide, as appropriate, support directly or through the Organization to States, especially developing States, that request technical assistance.
2 The Administration of a Party shall co-operate actively with other Parties, subject to its national laws, regulations and policies, to promote the development and transfer of technology and exchange of information to States which request technical assistance, particularly developing States, in respect of the implementation of measures to fulfil the requirements of chapter 4 of this annex, in particular regulations 19.4 to 19.6."
