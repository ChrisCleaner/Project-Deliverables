ANNEX II
LIST OF HAZARDOUS CHARACTERISTICS
UN CLASS [*]
CODE
CHARACTERISTICS
1
H1
Explosive
An explosive substance or waste is a solid or liquid substance or waste (or mixture of substances or wastes) which is in itself capable by chemical reaction of producing gas at such a temperature and pressure and at such speed as to cause damage to the surroundings.
3
H3
Flammable liquids
The word "flammable" has the same meaning as "inflammable". Flammable liquids are liquids, or mixtures of liquids, or liquids containing solids in solution or suspension (for example, paints, varnishes, lacquers, etc., but not including substances or wastes otherwise classified on account of their dangerous characteristics) which give off a flammable vapour at temperatures of not more than 60.5 degrees C, closed-cup test, or not more than 65.6 degrees C, open-cup test. (Since the results of open-cup tests and of closed-cup tests are not strictly comparable and even individual results by the same test are often variable, regulations varying from the above figures to make allowance for such differences would be within the spirit of this definition).
4.1
H4.1
Flammable solids
Solids, or waste solids, other than those classed as explosives, which under conditions encountered in transport are readily combustible, or may cause or contribute to fire through friction.
4.2
H4.2
Substances or wastes liable to spontaneous combustion
Substances or wastes which are liable to spontaneous heating under normal conditions encountered in transport, or to heating up on contact with air, and being then liable to catch fire.
4.3
H4.3
Substances or wastes which, in contact with water, emit flammable gases
Substances or wastes which, by interaction with water, are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities.
5.1
H5.1
Oxidizing
Substances or wastes which, while in themselves not necessarily combustible, may, generally by yielding oxygen cause, or contribute to, the combustion of other materials.
5.2
H5.2
Organic peroxides
Organic substances or wastes which contain the bivalent-O - O-structure are thermally unstable substances which may undergo exothermic self-accelerating decomposition.
6.1
H6.1
Poisonous (Acute)
Substances or wastes liable either to cause death or serious injury or to harm human health if swallowed or inhaled or by skin contact.
6.2
H6.2
Infectious substances
Substances or wastes containing viable microorganisms or their toxins which are known or suspected to cause disease in animals or humans.
8
H8
Corrosives
Substances or wastes which, by chemical action, will cause severe damage when in contact with living tissue, or in the case of leakage, will materially damage, or even destroy, other goods or the means of transport; they may also cause other hazards.
9
H10
Liberation of toxic gases in contact with air or water
Substances or wastes which, by interaction with air or water, are liable to give off toxic gases in dangerous quantities.
9
H11
Toxic (delayed or chronic)
Substances or wastes which, if they are inhaled or ingested or if they penetrate the skin, may involve delayed or chronic effects, including carcinogenicity.
9
H12
Ecotoxic
Substances or wastes which, if released, present or may present immediate or delayed adverse impacts to the environment by means of bioaccumulation and/or toxic effects upon biotic systems.
9
H13
Capable, by any means, after disposal, of yielding another material, e.g. leachate, which possesses any of the characteristics listed above.
Tests
The potential hazards posed by certain types of wastes are not yet fully documented; tests to define quantitatively these hazards do not exist. Further research is necessary in order to develop means to characterise potential hazards posed to human health and the environment by these wastes. Standardised tests have been derived with respect to pure substances and materials. Many countries have developed national tests which can be applied to materials listed in Annex I, in order to decide if these materials exhibit any of the characteristics listed in this Annex.
