SRC: http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/087.htm, 20040823
The member States of the Council of Europe signatory hereto,
Considering that it is desirable to adopt common provisions for the protection of animals kept for farming purposes, particularly in modern intensive stock-farming systems, 
Have agreed as follows:
Chapter I - General principles
Article 1
This Convention shall apply to the keeping, care and housing of animals, and in particular to animals in modern intensive stock-farming systems. For the purposes of this Convention animals shall mean animals bred or kept for the production of food, wool, skin or fur or for other farming purposes, and modern intensive stock-farming systems shall mean systems which predominantly employ technical installations operated principally by means of automatic processes.
Article 2
Each Contracting Party shall give effect to the principles of animal welfare laid down in Articles 3 to 7 of this Convention.
Article 3
Animals shall be housed and provided with food, water and care in a manner which - having regard to their species and to their degree of development, adaptation and domestication - is appropriate to their physiological and ethological needs in accordance with established experience and scientific knowledge.
Article 4
1. The freedom of movement appropriate to an animal, having regard to its species and in accordance with established experience and scientific knowledge, shall not be restricted in such a manner as to cause it unnecessary suffering or injury.
2. Where an animal is continuously or regularly tethered or confined, it shall be given the space appropriate to its physiological and ethological needs in accordance with established experience and scientific knowledge.
Article 5
The lighting, temperature, humidity, air circulation, ventilation, and other environmental conditions such as gas concentration or noise intensity in the place in which an animal is housed, shall - having regard to its species and to its degree of development, adaptation and domestication - conform to its physiological and ethological needs in accordance with established experience and scientific knowledge.
Article 6
No animal shall be provided with food or liquid in a manner, nor shall such food or liquid contain any substance, which may cause unnecessary suffering or injury.
Article 7
1. The condition and state of health of animals shall be thoroughly inspected at intervals sufficient to avoid unnecessary suffering and in the case of animals kept in modern intensive stock-farming at least once a day.
2. The technical equipment used in modern intensive stock-farming systems shall be thoroughly inspected at least once a day, and any defect discovered shall be remedied with the least possible delay. When a defect cannot be remedied forthwith, all temporary measures necessary to safeguard the welfare of the animals shall be taken immediately.
Chapter II - Detailed implementation
Article 8
1. A Standing Committee shall be set up within a year of the entry into force of this Convention.
2. Each Contracting Party shall have the right to appoint a representative to the Standing Committee. Any member State of the Council of Europe which is not a Contracting Party to the Convention shall have the right to be represented on the Committee by an observer.
3. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe shall convene the Standing Committee whenever he finds it necessary and in any case when a majority of the representatives of the Contracting Parties or the representative of the European Economic Community, being itself a Contracting Party, request its convocation.
4. A majority of representatives of the Contracting Parties shall constitute a quorum for holding a meeting of the Standing Committee.
5. The Standing Committee shall take its decision by a majority of the votes cast; however, unanimity of the votes cast shall be required for:
a. the adoption of the recommendations provided for in paragraph 1 of Article 9;
b. the decision to admit observers other than those referred to in paragraph 2 of this article;
c. the adoption of the report referred to in Article 13; this report could set out, where appropriate, divergent opinions.
6. Subject to the provisions of this Convention, the Standing Committee shall draw up its own rules of procedure.
Article 9
1. The Standing Committee shall be responsible for the elaboration and adoption of recommendations to the Contracting Parties containing detailed provisions for the implementation of the principles set out in Chapter I of this Convention, to be based on scientific knowledge concerning the various species of animals.
2. For the purpose of carrying out its responsibilities under paragraph 1 of this article, the Standing Committee shall follow developments in scientific research and new methods in animal husbandry.
3. Unless a longer period is decided upon by the Standing Committee, a recommendation shall become effective as such six months after the date of its adoption by the Committee. As from the date when a recommendation becomes effective each Contracting Party shall either implement it or inform the Standing Committee by notification to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe of the reasons why it has decided that it cannot implement the recommendation or can no longer implement it.
4. If two or more Contracting Parties or the European Economic Community, being itself a Contracting Party, have given notice in accordance with paragraph 3 of this article of their decision not to implement or no longer to implement a recommendation, that recommendation shall cease to have effect.
Article 10
The Standing Committee shall use its best endeavours to facilitate a friendly settlement of any difficulty which may arise between Contracting Parties concerning the implementation of this Convention.
Article 11
The Standing Committee may express an advisory opinion on any question concerning the protection of animals at the request of a Contracting Party.
