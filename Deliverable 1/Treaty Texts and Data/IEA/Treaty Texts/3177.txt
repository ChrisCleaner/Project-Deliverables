Preamble
The Contracting Parties,
Conscious of the importance of fisheries and aquaculture for the development of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean;
Recognizing that the majority of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean would gain significantly from the development of their fishery sectors and that this could depend in part on the establishment of an information and advisory service on the international fishery market, thereby better balancing market supply, promoting a more advantageous price structure and stimulating a more appropriate use of fishery resources;
Conscious that the promotion and success of such results can be accelerated through regional cooperation;
Considering that the best means of achieving such cooperation is to establish an intergovernmental organization that conducts its activities in collaboration with States, other intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, institutions and private enterprises that may be able to provide financial and technical support;
Have agreed to establish the Centre for Marketing Information and Advisory Services for Fishery Products in Latin America and the Caribbean, hereinafter referred to as "INFOPESCA", which shall be organized and shall function in accordance with the present Constitution:
