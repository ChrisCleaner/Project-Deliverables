PREAMBLE
THE CONTRACTING PARTIES,
RECOGNIZING the need for improved scientific understanding of the North Pacific Ocean and its processes, living resources, and oceanographic features;
AWARE that due to the vast expanse of the North Pacific Ocean, scientific understanding of the area can be best achieved through a spirit of international scientific cooperation on a mutually beneficial basis;
DESIRING to establish an appropriate intergovernmental organization to promote and facilitate such scientific cooperation and avoid duplication of effort;
ACKNOWLEDGING that the activity of the organization must be based on the principles and rules of the international law of the sea applicable to marine scientific research,
HAVE AGREED as follows:
Article I
Establishment of the Organization
The Contracting Parties hereby establish an intergovernmental organization entitled the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES), hereinafter referred to as the "Organization".
Article II
The Area Concerned
The area which the activities of the Organization concern shall be the temperate and sub-Arctic region of the North Pacific Ocean and its adjacent seas, especially northward from 30 degrees North Latitude, hereinafter referred to as the "area concerned". Activities of the Organization, for scientific reasons, may extend farther southward in the North Pacific Ocean.
Article III
Purpose of the Organization
The purpose of the Organization shall be:
(a) to promote and coordinate marine scientific research in order to advance scientific knowledge of the area concerned and of its living resources, including but not necessarily limited to research with respect to the ocean environment and its interactions with land and atmosphere, its role in and response to global weather and climate change, its flora, fauna and ecosystems, its uses and resources, and impacts upon it from human activities; and
