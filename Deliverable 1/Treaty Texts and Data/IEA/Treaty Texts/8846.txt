Annex N
Amendments to the Schedule
At the 66th Meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Portorož, Slovenia from 24-28 October 2016, no modifications were made to the provision for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and 1985/86 pelagic seasons.
The following updates to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling therefore become necessary (changes in bold italic type, [ED: between square brackets to accommodate plain text]):
For paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
• Substitute the dates 2014/2015 pelagic season and 2015 coastal season for [2016/2017] pelagic season and [2017] coastal season as appropriate.
In accordance with Article V of the Convention, these amendments become effective with respect to each Contracting Government ninety days following the date of this letter, unless any Contracting Government lodges an objection, in which case the procedure under Article V, paragraph 3 of the Convention will be followed.
The ninety days period will expire on 05 February 2017. In the absence of objections by that date the updates will become effective. Contracting Governments will be notified accordingly.
