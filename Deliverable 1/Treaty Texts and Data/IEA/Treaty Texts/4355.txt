CONVINCED that natural forests and the unique forms of life within them must be safeguarded independent of their usefulness to humanity;
RECOGNISING the value of forests to humanity, including their role in maintaining the earth's climate, in controlling floods and erosion, as sources of clean water, food, wood and other forest products as well as having spiritual, cultural and aesthetic value to humans;
MINDFUL of the special needs of small island States, which do not have transboundary forests;
RECOGNISING that many people in the Region depend on forests for their livelihood and that sustainable forest management is essential to the alleviation of poverty;
