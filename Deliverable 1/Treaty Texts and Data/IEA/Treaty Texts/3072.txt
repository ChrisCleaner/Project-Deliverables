The General Conference:
Taking into account the decision of the First Meeting of Signatories of the Treaty of Tlatelolco;
Recalling Resolution 22 Rev.1 of the Council of OPANAL and the deliberations occurred within the Meeting, on this Resolution;
Considering the constant reiteration of the General Conference of OPANAL, expressed in several Resolutions and especially Resolution 213 (X) of April 29, 1987, that one of the main aims of the Treaty of Tlatelolco is to keep the area within the Zone of application established in Article 4 free of nuclear weapons, being its aspiration that all Latin American and Caribbean States become Parties to the Treaty and also become full Members of OPANAL;
Recalling also Resolution 207 (IX) of the General Conference adopted on May 9, 1985, which recognizes "the fact that the adhesion of various Caribbean States to the Treaty of Tlatelolco reflects the growing plurality of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America",
Resolves:
1. To add to the denomination of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America the terms "and the Caribbean"; hence, to make this modification in the legal denomination established in Article 7 of the Treaty.
2. To request the Council to instruct the Good Offices Committee to continue its efforts, in consultation with the countries directly interested, in order to solve the existent problem related to the scope of paragraph 2, Article 25, of the Treaty of Tlatelolco and report to the Council on the result of its work not later than next August 15.
