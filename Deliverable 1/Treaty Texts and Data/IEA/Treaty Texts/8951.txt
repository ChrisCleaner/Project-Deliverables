Article 2: Objective
The present Annex No.2 is adopted in application of articles 2, 5, 6, 7, 10 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 27, 28 and 33 of the Niger Basin Water Charter, the provisions of which it specifies and completes in terms of coordinated management of the structuring dams.
Its aim is to define the general rules, methods and constraints for the coordinated management of all the existing and future structuring dams on the Niger river and its tributaries, and includes the major social, economic and environmental challenges of the hydrographic drainage basin.
Article 3: Fundamental principles and scope
The rules and fundamental principles of the coordinated management of the structuring dams are formulated:
- At "strategic" level for the management at seasonal scale based on the hydrological and hydraulic objectives to be achieved indicated by management graphs to be respected for each structuring dam;
- At "tactical" level for the operational management implemented respecting the management strategy;
- For the emergency situations.
The coordinated management must satisfy or conciliate the requirements in terms of:
- Potable water supply, public health, water security and flood protection;
- Energy production;
Protection of ecosystems and wetlands as well as maintaining the biodiversity, in particular of the fish fauna, in the receiving environments;
- Need for agriculture, livestock breeding, fishing, marine cultures, industry, river transport, tourism, protected areas, as well as for all other legally exercised anthropogenic activities;
- Conservation and free flow of water.
Therefore, the following factors are taken into account:
- The data relating to the hydrology of the Niger river and its tributaries, and their prospects;
- The different uses of the water resource and their related stakes, and the associated prospects;
- The characteristics of the structuring dams and associated infrastructures especially irrigated areas;
- The objectives to be respected for the conciliation of the uses in the Niger Basin in terms of target baseflows, target flow rates and flood volumes;
- The safety standards of the structuring dams.
The present Annex No.2 is applicable to all existing or future structuring dams in the Niger Basin.
CHAPTER 2: STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
Article 4: Strategic management objectives
The general objective of the coordinated management of the structuring dams at "strategic" level is to optimize the management of the resource to rationally and sustainably satisfy the different uses and is based, for each dam, on a set of management graphs, each relative to a different water status of the basin.
According to the period of the year and to the water level of the structuring dam, these management graphs define operational guidelines such as flow rates to be discharged (excluding emergency situations). The management graphs of a structuring dam depend on those of the others, hence the need for a coordinated approach.
The strategic management consists of defining and updating, where necessary, these management graphs, at the scale of the basin by taking into account ail the structuring dams, to be able to guarantee a coordinated management integrating the needs and the environmental challenges in the whole of the Niger Basin. The strategic management is defined based on a series of long historic flow rates which are representative of the river's hydraulicity.
Strategic management includes:
- The existing structuring dams and those under construction as well as their hydraulic characteristics;
- The uses and the needs of the water resources based on the SDAP, such as:
o The potable water needs;
o The energy production;
o The existing large irrigated areas and those under development;
o The navigation;
o The water supply for livestock;
- The data relating to the hydrology of the Niger river and of its tributaries, including seasonal and interannual variations through representative historical chronologies;
- The locations of the coordinated management points;
- The environmental preoccupations by respecting the target baseflow rates and additional target flow rates at the coordinated management points, and by maintaining the floods downstream of the structuring dams.
Article 5: Establishment and implementation of strategic management
The coordinated management of the structuring dams at strategic level is established using the water resource integrated modelling and management tools of the Niger Basin Observatory which is responsible for producing the strategic management graphs, in collaboration with the State Parties.
The results of the simulations and the resulting management graphs for the dams, as well as the target flow rates at the coordinated management points which are associated with them, are sent by the NBA's Executive Secretary to the Permanent Technical Committee for opinion. The management graphs and the target flow rates are then approved by the NBA's Council of Ministers before notifying State Parties.
The Ministry in charge of the Niger Basin Authority, via the National Focal Structure, is responsible - in concertation with the main users and particularly the operators of the structuring dams and of the irrigated areas, as well as with the technical ministries â€“ for communicating the necessary data to the Niger Basin Authority for the construction of the coordinated management graphs. 
When approved, each Owner ensures that the management graphs of the dam concerned are implemented.
At the start of the hydrological year, then during the season according to the changes in the water flow, the Observatory informs the owners and managers of the strategic management graph which must be respected for each dam.
The States Parties undertake to transmit to the Permanent Technical Committee, via the NBA's Executive Secretariat, an annual coordinated management report for the structuring dams which concern them at national level or which are in common.
The Niger Basin Observatory is responsible for the annual monitoring and assessment of the implementation of the strategic management over the whole of the basin. It fills in the monitoring and assessment indicators. It sends its conclusions to the Permanent Technical Committee.
Article 6: Conditions for revision of the strategic management graphs
The management graphs of the structuring dams are revised by the Niger Basin Observatory when there are major structural modifications in the Niger Basin: the construction of a new structuring dam, the creation of a new large irrigated area or if a lasting change is observed in the hydraulics of the Niger river or of one of its tributaries.
The management graphs are revised upon proposal by the NBA's Permanent Technical Committee, or if requested by a State Party.
Article 7: Procedural Manual
The Procedural Manual for the coordinated management of the structuring dams in the Niger Basin is drawn up by the Niger Basin Observatory in collaboration with the States Parties, the owners and the managers. It is sent by the NBA's Executive Secretary to the Permanent Technical Committee for opinion, and then approved by the NBA's Council of Ministers.
The Procedural Manual includes:
- The list of existing structuring dams or those under construction;
- The 1ist and locations of the coordinated management points and of the target baseflow points;
- The values of the target flow rates at these points;
- The reference values of the flow rates and volumes of the floods;
- The strategic management graphs ("envelope graphs") of each of these structuring dams;
- The timelines and the planned future revisions according to the future structuring dams or other projected changes;
- The list of strategic management indicators;
- And any other document deemed relevant by the stakeholders.
The NBA's Executive Secretariat sends the Procedural Manual to the Owners concerned and, where applicable, to their delegated managers.
CHAPTER 3: TACTICAL MANAGEMENT
Article 8: Tactical management objectives
The Tactical management corresponds to the day-to-day operational management of the structuring dams. Its general objective is to determine the water volumes and the flow rates to be discharged downstream of each structuring dam according to the daily hydrological data, the forecast water intakes, the daily water levels of the reservoirs and the water needs. It is carried out respecting the management strategy and the strategic management graphs, excluding emergency situations.
Article 9: Implementation of tactical management
The tactical management is implemented by the owners and their delegated managers, who have a certain latitude to take account of local demands and constraints.
The Niger Basin Observatory supports the tactical management by publishing and circulating necessary information to the structuring dam owners or their delegated managers including the hydrological statuses and the hydrological forecasts at an appropriate frequency.
CHAPTER 4: EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
Article 10: Emergency management objectives
The States Parties and the NBA's Executive Secretariat reiterate their commitment under Annex No.l of the Niger Basin Water Charter relating to environment protection to jointly manage the emergency situations in the basin.
Emergency management consists of alerting, communicating and temporarily adapting the methods of structuring dam management and of uses while minimizing the socio-economic and environmental impacts.
In the context of the present Annex No.2, the emergency management is initiated in the event of severe water shortages, risks of exceptional floods or the risk of a structuring dams bursting, or any other extreme situation representing a case of force majeure, which originates on a State's territory and which risks suddenly and negatively affecting other States Parties.
The NBA's Executive Secretariat, in cooperation with the States Parties, defines the alert thresholds corresponding to the emergency situations.
A state of vigilance is declared when the forecast change in the observed values indicates a risk of crossing the alert thresholds, particularly by means of the analysis of the risk of not achieving the fixed strategic management objectives.
Article 11: Implementation of hydrological emergency management
Since these are emergency situations, the NBA's Executive Secretariat, or the States Parties concerned, initiates the alert to the NBA and to the other States Parties concerned immediately following the observation by the National Hydrological Services, the Niger Basin Observatory, the dam owners or their delegated managers of a critical value seen on a hydrological indicator or on an economic use.
ln the event of drought, the States Parties undertake to take the necessary measures to limit water withdrawals and take ail other suitable measures. The NBA's Executive Secretariat and the States Parties will agree on an order of priority for the use of the water resource based on the SDAP and on the provisions of the Niger Basin Water Charter.
ln the case of exceptional floods, special care will be given to the spread of the flood, and to the initiation of the safety instructions for persons and property, and of the dam safety instructions, to minimize the impacts of the flood.
Article 12: Implementation of emergency management if there is a risk of dams bursting
Since this concerns dam safety, the States Parties initiate the alert to the NBA and to the other States Parties concerned immediately when a critical value is observed on a dam safety indicator by the structuring managers, owners or the States Parties.
The structuring dams must be constantly under surveillance by and at the expense of the Owner (or his delegated manager) and have surveillance and intervention instructions for ail circumstances. In an emergency, the planned measures are implemented.
The instructions and the servicing and maintenance program for the structuring dams are drawn up in compliance with the national regulations in force and with the regional and international recommendations relating to the safety of large dams. These measures are verified by the competent national authorities. They are revised and, if necessary, updated according to the regulatory changes or changes in the practices. They are sent to the Permanent Technical Committee by the NBA's Executive Secretariat for information and opinion.
Article 13: Notification of emergency situations
The notification of an emergency situation between the States Parties is performed in compliance with Article 196 of Annex No.1 of the Niger Basin Water Charter relating to environment protection.
The NBA's Executive Secretariat can also give notification of an emergency situation. The notification then indicates the type and characteristics of the emergency situation, as well as the management methods to be applied for the structuring dams and for the uses. In the event of a water shortage, these methods must minimize the socio-economic and environmental impacts.
In the event of an extreme emergency situation for the protection of public health, public safety or other equally important reasons, the States affected can immediately implement measures to attenuate the consequences, notwithstanding the notification obligation. In this case, a formal declaration is required declaring the urgency of the planned measures.
In all cases, the NBA ensures that the information is correctly transmitted to the States Parties and between States Parties, and ensures that the measures to be applied by the States Parties are coordinated.
CHAPTER 5: HYDROLOGICAL MONITORING AND INFORMATION SHARING
Article 14: Hydrological monitoring
The States Parties, in collaboration with the NBA's Executive Secretariat, undertake to ensure the smooth operation of the hydrometric stations necessary for the prediction of the water intakes and for the monitoring of the structuring dams and target flow rates at the coordinated management points.
The NBA supports the States Parties in equipping with automatic data transmission systems the hydrometric stations essential for the coordinated management at strategic, tactical and emergency level, and for the associated forecasts (including the levels of the reservoirs of the structuring dams). The NBA receives this data in real time at the same time as the national hydrological services.
Article 15: Information sharing
The States Parties reiterate their commitment to send to the Niger Basin Observatory the hydrological information, the data relating to the operational management of the large dams and the information relating to the uses (in particular for the large irrigated areas and the electricity production), via the National Hydrological Service, the National Focal Structure and the Network of data and information producers and exchanges.
From this data, in addition to the various transnational hydrological monitoring applications (e.g. flood alert), the NBA communicates to the States Parties the data and the elements relating to the coordinated management of the structuring dams in application of the present Annex No.2.
