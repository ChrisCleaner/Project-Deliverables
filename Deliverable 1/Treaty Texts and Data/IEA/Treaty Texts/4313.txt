In signing the Convention for the Protection of the Rhine, the heads of delegation in the ICPR agree upon the following points. 
1. The following shall remain unaffected by the Convention: 
(a) the Convention of 3 December 1976 for the protection of the Rhine against Pollution by Chlorides; 
(b) the Exchange of letters of 29 April/ 13 May 1983 on the abovementioned Convention, which exchange entered into force on 5 July 1985; 
(c) the Declaration of 11 December 1986 of the heads of delegation of the Governments Party to the Agreement of 29 April 1963 concerning the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine against Pollution; 
(d) the Additional Protocol of 25 September 1991 on the Convention of 3 December 1976 for the protection of the Rhine against Pollution by Chlorides; 
(e) the Declaration of 25 September 1991 of the heads of delegation of the Governments Party to the Agreement of 29 April 1963 concerning the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine against Pollution. 
2. "State of the art" and "best available techniques" are synonymous expressions and, like the expression "best environmental practice", must be understood as defined in the Convention of 17 March 1992 on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes (Annexes I and II) and the Convention of 22 September 1992 for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic (Appendix 1). 
3. The Commission shall continue to have its seat in Koblenz. 
4. In cases of settlements of disputes between Member States of the European Community which do not concern any other State, Article 219 of the Treaty establishing the European Community shall apply.
