Annex III
Per-Stock, Per-Year Dolphin Mortality Caps
1.The Parties shall establish, at a meeting convened pursuant to Article VIII of this Agreement, a per-stock, per-year dolphin mortality cap for each stock of dolphins, determined by the Meeting of the Parties, based on the best available scientific evidence, of between 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent of the Minimum Estimated Abundance (Nmin) as calculated by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service or equivalent calculation standard as might be developed or recommended by the Scientific Advisory Board but in no event shall the total annual incidental dolphin mortality exceed 5,000, consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. In the year 2001 and thereafter, the per-stock, per-year cap shall be 0.1 percent of Nmin.
2. The Parties shall conduct in 1998, or as soon as possible thereafter, a scientific review and assessment of progress toward the year 2001 objective, and consider recommendations as appropriate. Up to the year 2001, in the event that annual mortality of 0.2 percent of Nmin is exceeded for any stock of dolphins, all sets on that stock and on any mixed schools containing members of that stock shall cease for that year. Beginning in the year 2001, in the event that annual mortality of 0.1 percent of Nmin is exceeded for any stock of dolphins, all sets on that stock and on any mixed schools containing members of that stock shall cease for that year. In the event that annual mortality of 0.1 percent of Nmin is exceeded for either eastern spinner or northeastern spotted dolphin stocks, the Parties shall conduct a scientific review and assessment and consider further recommendations.
3. For purposes of this Agreement, the Parties shall use the current estimate of absolute abundance for the dolphin stocks of the eastern Pacific Ocean presented by Wade and Gerrodette to the International Whaling Commission in 1992, based on U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service research vessel data for the period 1986-1990, until the Parties agree on an updated set of figures. Such updates could result from the analysis of data from future research cruises and indices of abundance and other relevant scientific data from the Parties, the IATTC and other scientific organizations.
4. The Parties shall establish a system, based on real-time observer reporting, to ensure effective implementation and compliance with the per-stock, per-year dolphin mortality cap.
5. Within six months of the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall establish a system for the allocation of the per-stock per-year dolphin mortality cap for each stock for the ensuing year and years thereafter. This system shall provide for the distribution of the mortality limits in Paragraph 1 of this Annex among vessels of the Parties which are eligible for Dolphin Mortality Limits, in accordance with Annex IV. When establishing this system, the Parties shall consider the best available scientific evidence on the distribution and abundance of the stocks in question, and other variables which the Meeting of the Parties shall define at a later date.
Annex IV
Dolphin Mortality Limits (DMLs)
I. Assignment of DMLs
1. Each Party shall provide to the Meeting of the Parties, through the Director, prior to October 1 of each year, a list of vessels under its jurisdiction of carrying capacity greater than 363 metric tons (400 short tons) that have requested a full-year DML for the following year, indicating those other vessels that are likely to be operating in the Agreement Area in the following year, and vessels that have requested a second-semester DML for the following year.
2. The IRP shall, by November 1 of each year, or later if agreed by the IRP, provide to the Meeting of the Parties a list of qualified applicant vessels eligible to receive a DML. For purposes of this Agreement, a vessel shall be considered qualified if:
a. it has been certified by the relevant national authorities to be in possession of all of the dolphin safety gear and equipment required in Annex VIII;
b. its captain and crew have received approved training in dolphin release and rescue techniques comparable to a standard established by the Meeting of the Parties;
c. it is over 363 metric tons (400 short tons) carrying capacity in size;
d. it has a captain considered qualified due to his or her prior record of performance; and
e. the vessel is not deemed to be disqualified under Section II of this Annex.
3. A vessel shall not be considered qualified under paragraph 2 if, on the date of the request pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Annex, the vessel is operating under the jurisdiction of a Party whose applicable laws and regulations prohibit vessels under its jurisdiction from fishing for tuna in association with dolphins; nor shall DMLs be assigned to any Party in order to provide permits for fishing in the Agreement Area to vessels flying the flag of another State whose applicable laws and regulations prohibit vessels under its jurisdiction from fishing for tuna in association with dolphins.
4. 98 percent, or such other unreserved portion as the Parties might determine, of the overall dolphin mortality limit for the fishery (5,000, or such other lower limit as the Parties might determine) shall be used to calculate into an average individual vessel DML (ADML) and distributed among the Parties for the succeeding year, as set forth in paragraph 5 of this Section.
5. The ADML shall be calculated by dividing the unreserved portion of the overall DML for the fishery established under paragraph 4 by the total number of qualified vessels requesting full-year DMLs. The distribution of DMLs among Parties shall be determined by multiplying the ADML by the number of qualified vessels requesting full-year DMLs and operating under the jurisdiction of each Party.
6. The remaining two percent, or such other portion as the Parties might determine, of the overall DML for the fishery shall be maintained as a separate Reserve DML Allocation (RDA), to be managed at the discretion of the Director. Any Party may request that the Director assign DMLs from such RDA to vessels fishing under its jurisdiction which do not normally fish for tuna in the Agreement Area but which may, from time to time, desire to participate in the fishery in the Agreement Area on a limited basis, provided that such vessels and their captains and crews meet the operational and training requirements set forth in Annex VIII of this Agreement and that the requirements set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3, of this Section are met. Any accidental mortalities caused by vessels operating in the Agreement Area under the jurisdiction of any of the Parties that have not requested DMLs for their fleet shall also be deducted from this RDA.
7. No DML shall be assigned to a vessel which has been determined by the Parties to have engaged in a pattern of violations, as confirmed through enforcement actions taken against such vessel by the Party under whose jurisdiction it operates, which diminish the effectiveness of the International Dolphin Conservation Program.
8. The individual Parties with qualified vessels that will be fishing for tuna in association with dolphins shall manage their DMLs in a responsible manner, provided that no individual vessel shall receive a total annual DML in excess of the DML established for 1997 by the IRP, and reported in the Minutes of the 14th Meeting of the IRP, held on February 19-20, 1997, under the La Jolla Agreement. No Party shall allocate to the total of its qualified vessels a greater number of DMLs than those that such Party has been allocated under Sections I and III of this Annex. No initial assignment of DMLs may result in any vessel receiving a DML in excess of the ADML unless its performance in reducing dolphin mortalities, as measured by the IRP based upon the previous two years' data, is better than the average performance of the international fleet as a whole. No initial assignment of DMLs may result in any vessel receiving a DML in excess of the ADML if, during the previous year, it has committed any of the infractions identified in Section III, paragraph 4 of this Annex, subject to the conditions established pursuant to that paragraph.
9. Should the total mortalities of the fleet of any Party meet or exceed the total amount of DML distributed to it pursuant to this Annex, fishing for tuna in association with dolphins shall cease for all vessels operating under the jurisdiction of that Party.
10. Each Party shall, no later than February 1 of each year, notify the Director of the initial allocation of its distributed DML among its fleet. No vessel may begin fishing for tunas associated with dolphins until the Director receives such notification.
II. Utilization of DMLs
1. Any vessel which is assigned a full-year DML and does not set on dolphins prior to April 1 of that year, or which is assigned a second-semester DML and does not set on dolphins by December 31 of that year, or which is assigned a per-trip DML from the RDA and does not set on dolphins during that trip, unless as a result of force majeure or extraordinary circumstances, as agreed by the IRP, shall lose its DML and may not set on dolphins for the remainder of that year. Any such vessel that loses its DML on two consecutive occasions shall not be eligible to receive a DML for the following year.
2. Within six months following entry into force of this Agreement, the IRP, in cooperation with the scientific staff of the IATTC, shall develop and recommend a system by which to measure DML utilization in order to deter frivolous requests for DMLs. Such recommended system shall be presented for consideration by the Meeting of the Parties.
III. Use of forfeited or unutilized DMLs
1. After April 1 of each year, any DMLs which the Director determines will not be utilized pursuant to Section II or which have otherwise been forfeited shall be reallocated to the Parties consistent with this Section.
2. On the first working day in April of each year, the full-year DMLs assigned to those vessels that have not utilized them, pursuant to Section II, or have otherwise forfeited them, shall be redistributed among the Parties by the Director, consistent with the formula established pursuant to Section I, paragraph 5, but after first adjusting such formula as set forth in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) below. Such additional DMLs may be reallocated by the individual Parties among qualified vessels under the jurisdiction of such Party, subject to limitations and conditions set forth in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of this Section.
a. In performing the reallocation, any vessels that may have lost or otherwise forfeited DMLs under this paragraph, and any vessels requesting second-semester DMLs after the deadline set forth in Section I, paragraph 1, shall not be considered.
b. Prior to establishing the number of DMLs available for reallocation under this Section, adjustment shall be made by subtracting from such number any observed dolphin mortalities caused by those vessels that lost their DMLs under Section II, paragraph 1.
c. Prior to establishing the number of DMLs available for reallocation under this Section, the Director shall deduct one third of the ADML calculated pursuant to Section I, paragraph 5, for allocation to each vessel requesting a second-semester DML prior to the deadline established pursuant to Section I, paragraph 1. Such second-semester DMLs shall be allocated by the Director to the Parties proportionately, based upon the jurisdiction of respective Parties over vessels covered under this subparagraph. The second-semester DMLs assigned to such vessels by the Parties under whose jurisdiction they operate shall not exceed one-third of the ADML calculated pursuant to Section I, paragraph 5. Such vessels may not begin setting on dolphins before July 1 of that year.
3. Any Party may adjust the DMLs of its qualified vessels which meet the criteria set forth in Section I, paragraph 2, of this Annex either upward or downward, provided that no vessel is assigned an adjusted DML in excess of 50 percent above its initial DML, unless its performance in successfully reducing dolphin mortalities, as measured by the IRP, is in the upper 60 percent of the performance of the international fleet as a whole, as determined by the IRP, based upon the prior year's data. A Party making such an adjustment shall so notify the Director no later than May 1, and no such adjustment shall take effect until the Director has been notified.
4. No vessel may have its initial DML adjusted upward by any Party if the IRP had determined, and the Party with jurisdiction over the vessel concurs, that during that year or the previous year:
a. the vessel fished without an observer;
b. the vessel set on dolphins without a DML;
c. the vessel set on dolphins after reaching its DML;
d. the vessel knowingly set on a banned dolphin stock;
e. the captain, crew, or the vessel owner committed any of the actions described in Annex II, Paragraph 6(f) of this Agreement;
f. the vessel made a sanctionable night set; or
g. the vessel used explosives during any phase of a fishing operation involving dolphins.
For infractions described in (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), and (g), a Party will be deemed to have provided such concurrence if it does not object to the IRP within six months of a referral of a possible violation from the IRP. For the infraction described in (e), a Party will be deemed to have provided such concurrence if it does not object to the IRP within 12 months of such referral.
5. No vessel may be eligible to receive an additional allocation of DML by a Party unless it has on board all of the required dolphin safety gear and equipment throughout the year; and no such upward allocation may be made for a vessel which has exceeded its initial DML prior to April 1, unless due to force majeure or extraordinary circumstances, as agreed by the Meeting of the Parties, in consultation with the IRP. 6.For any vessel exceeding its DML, as it may be adjusted pursuant to this Annex, during a given year, the amount of such excess, plus an additional 50 percent of that amount, unless the IRP recommends otherwise, shall be deducted from DMLs assigned to that vessel by a Party under whose jurisdiction the vessel operates over subsequent years in a manner prescribed by the IRP. 7.If at any time a vessel meets or exceeds its DML, as it may be adjusted pursuant to this Annex, that vessel shall immediately cease all fishing for tuna in association with dolphins.
IV. Implementation
1. The Parties shall ensure that in the implementation of the DML system established by this Annex, the per-stock, per-year dolphin mortality caps, as specified in Annex III, are not exceeded.
2. In cases involving unusual or extraordinary circumstances not foreseen in this Annex, the Parties, as recommended by the IRP, may take such measures as are necessary, consistent with the provisions of this Annex, in order to implement the DML system.
3. If the mortality in any given year increases above levels which the IRP considers to be significant, the IRP shall recommend that the Parties hold a meeting to review and identify the causes of mortality and formulate options to address such causes.
Annex V

Annex VIII
Operational Requirements For Vessels
1. For the purposes of this Annex:
a. "Strip" means a section of net that is approximately 6 fathoms deep.
b. "Backdown" means the procedure for releasing captured dolphins by shifting the vessel's engine(s) into reverse during net retrieval, causing the net remaining in the water to form a channel, and the corkline at the apex of the channel to submerge.
c. "Bunch" means a length of corkline gathered together.
d. "Sack-up" means that part of the fishing process when the catch is concentrated near the surface for loading aboard the vessel.
2. Dolphin Safety Gear and Equipment Requirements
A vessel with a carrying capacity of more than 363 metric tons (400 short tons) operating in the Agreement Area shall:
a. Have a purse seine equipped with a dolphin safety panel (DSP) with the following characteristics:
i. A minimum length of 180 fathoms (as measured before installation), except that the minimum length of the DSP in nets deeper than 18 strips must be determined in a ratio of 10 fathoms in length for each strip of net depth. The DSP must be installed so as to cover the backdown channel along the corkline, beginning at the outboard end of the last bow bunch pulled and continuing to at least two-thirds the distance from the apex of the backdown channel to the point where the net is secured at the stern. The DSP shall consist of small-mesh webbing not to exceed 1 Â¼ inches (3.2 cm) stretched mesh, extending downward from the corkline to a minimum depth of two strips.
ii. Each end shall be identified with a highly visible marker.
iii. Any space between the corks or the corkline and the small mesh shall not exceed 1 3/8 inches (3.5 cm) in diameter.
b. Have at least three operable speedboats. All operable speedboats shall be equipped with towing bridles or posts, and tow lines;
c. Have an operable raft suitable for the observation and rescue of dolphins;
d. Have at least two operable facemasks suitable for underwater observation; and
e. Have an operable long-range floodlight with a minimum output of 140,000 lumens.
3. Dolphin Protection and Release Requirements and Prohibitions
A vessel with a carrying capacity of more than 363 metric tons (400 short tons) operating in the Agreement Area shall:
a. Perform backdown during every set in which dolphins are captured, until it is no longer possible to remove live dolphins from the net by this procedure. At least one crewman shall be deployed during backdown to aid in the release of dolphins;
b. Continue efforts to release any live dolphins remaining in the net after backdown, so that all live dolphins are released prior to the initiation of the sack-up procedure;
c. Not sack-up or brail live dolphins;
d. Avoid injuring or killing dolphins captured in the course of fishing operations;
e. Complete backdown no later than thirty minutes after sunset, as determined by an accurate and reliable source approved by the Parties. A set that does not meet this requirement is termed a "night set";
f. Not use any type of explosive during any phase of a fishing operation involving dolphins (underwater flares are not considered to be explosives);
g. Cease setting on dolphins when its DML has been reached;
h. Not intentionally set on dolphins if the vessel does not have a DML; and
i. Perform a periodic net alignment to ensure the proper location of the dolphin safety panel during the backdown procedure, based on criteria established by the IRP.
It is emphasized that the above requirements should not lead to crewmen being placed in situations that present unnecessary risks to their personal safety.
4. Exceptions
a. A vessel without a DML is exempt from the requirements of Paragraph 2 of this Annex and from the obligation of carrying out the backdown manoeuvre mentioned in Paragraph 3 of this Annex unless the Party with jurisdiction over that vessel determines otherwise.
