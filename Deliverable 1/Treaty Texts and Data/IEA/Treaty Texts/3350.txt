The Contracting Parties,
Mindful of the need to protect and preserve the marine and coastal environment of the Northeast Pacific against all kinds and sources of environmental pollution and degradation.
Convinced of the ecological, economic, social and cultural value of the Northeast Pacific as a means of bonding between the countries of the region,
Considering the need to establish a regional cooperation framework to support and complement the coastal States of the Northeast Pacific in the effective implementation of the various international instruments relating to marine pollution and other forms of environmental degradation,
Mindful that, in conformity with the provisions of chapter 17 of Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the conservation and sustainable use of the marine and coastal environment and its natural resources in the Northeast Pacific is a joint responsibility of both national and municipal authorities and of civil society in its various organized manifestations,
Recognizing that the financial and human resources to implement the measures set out in this Convention will come, inter alia, from the public and private sectors, and that it is important to ensure the participation of the latter as associates,
Recognizing also the importance of international and non-governmental bodies responsible for facilitating funding giving priority in their general policies to the activities and projects aimed at implementing the Convention,
Recognizing further the benefits of cooperation at a regional level, directly or with the assistance of the competent international organizations and the rest of the international community, for the protection and preservation of the marine environment and the coastal areas mentioned,
Mindful that they share various ecosystems and resources of the marine environment in the Northeast Pacific,
Have agreed as follows:

ARTICLE 5
General obligations
1. The Contracting Parties shall, unilaterally, bilaterally or multilaterally, adopt appropriate measures pursuant to the provisions of this Convention, to prevent, reduce, control and avoid pollution of the marine and coastal environment of the Northeast Pacific, as well as other forms of deterioration that may affect these, and ensure sustainable environmental management of the marine and coastal areas and an effective development of their natural resources.
