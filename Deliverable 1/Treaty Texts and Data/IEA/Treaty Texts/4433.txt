At the 59th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Anchorage, Alaska from 28-31 May 2007, no modifications were made to the provision for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons.
The following amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling are therefore necessary (changes in bold italic type): [Editor's note: [deletions are represented here by square brackets]]{bold-italic additions are represented here by curly braces}
Paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
Substitute the dates {2007/2008} pelagic season, {2008} coastal season, {2008} season, or {2008} as appropriate.
Paragraph 13.(b)(1):
In sub-paragraph (i), substitute the dates 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 by {2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012} and the dates 1998-2002 by {2003-2007}.
Delete sub-paragraph (iii).
Paragraph 13.(b)(2)(i):
Substitute the dates 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 by {2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012}.
Paragraph 13.(b)(3) and footnotes 2 and • in Table 1:
Amend paragraph 13.(b)(3) as follows:
(3) The taking by aborigines of minke whales from the West Greenland and Central stocks and fin whales from the West Greenland stock {and bowhead whales from the West Greenland feeding aggregation} is permitted and then only when the meat and products are to be used exclusively for local consumption.
(i) The number of fin whales {struck} from the West Greenland stock [taken] in accordance with this sub-paragraph shall not exceed [the limits shown in Table 1] {19 in each of the years 2008, 2009, 2010,2011 and 2012}.
(ii) The number of minke whales {struck} from the Central stock [taken] in accordance with this sub-paragraph shall not exceed 12 in each of the years [2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007] {2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012,} except that any unused portion of the quota for each year shall be carried forward from that year and added to the quota of any {of the} subsequent years, provided that no more than 3 shall be added to the quota for any one year.
(iii) The number of minke whales struck from the West Greenland stock shall not exceed [175] {200} in each of the years [2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007] {2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012}, except that any unused portion of the strike quota for each year shall be carried forward from that year and added to the [strike] quota of any subsequent years, provided that no more than 15 strikes shall be added to the strike quota for any one year. This provision will be reviewed [if new scientific data become available within the 5 year period and necessary amended on the basis of the advice of the Scientific Committee] {annually by the Commission, according to the findings and recommendations by the Scientific Committee, which shall be binding}.
{(iv) The number of bowhead whales struck of West Greenland in accordance with this sub-paragraph shall not exceed 2 in each of the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, except that any unused portion of the quota for each year shal be carried forward from that year and added to the quota of any subsequent years, provided that no more than 2 shall be added to the quota for any one year. Furthermore, the quota for each year shall only become operative when the Commission has received advice from the Scientific Committee that the strikes are unlikely to endanger the stock.}
Amend Column ‘FIN', Table 1 as follows:
(a) footnote 2 should read:
‘Available to be {struck} by aborigines pursuant to paragraph 13 (b) 3. Catch limit for each of the years {2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012}.'
(b) footnote Δ should be deleted.
Paragraph 13.(b)(4):
Substitute 2003-2007 by {2008-2012}.
Delete the last sentence starting ‘The quota for the seasons….'.
