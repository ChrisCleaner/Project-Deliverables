At the 61st Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Madeira, Portugal from 22-25 June 2009, no modifications were made to the provision for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons.
Only the following amendments to the Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling are therefore necessary (changes in bold italics type [ED: represented by square brackets here.]):
Paragraphs 11 and 12, and Tables 1, 2 and 3:
- Substitute the dates [2009/2010] pelagic season, [2010] coastal season, [2010] season, or [2010] as appropriate.
