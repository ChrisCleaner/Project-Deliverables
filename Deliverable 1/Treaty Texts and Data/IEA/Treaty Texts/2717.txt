Article 11
a)If the courts having jurisdiction are those of a Contracting Party other than the Contracting Party in whose territory the nuclear installation of the operator liable is situated, the public funds required under Article 3 (b) (ii) and (f) shall be made available by the first-named Contracting Party. The Contracting Party in whose territory the nuclear installation of the operator liable is situated shall reimburse to the other Contracting Party the sums paid. These two Contracting Parties shall agree on the procedure of reimbursement.
b)In adopting all legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions, after the nuclear incident occurred, concerning the nature, form and extent of the compensation, the procedure for making available the public funds required under Article 3 (b) (ii) and, if necessary, the criteria for the apportionment of such funds, the Contracting Party whose courts have jurisdiction shall consult the Contracting Party in whose territory the nuclear installation of the operator liable is situated. It shall further take all measures necessary to enable the latter to intervene in proceedings and to participate in any settlement concerning compensation.
Article 12
a)The formula for contributions according to which the Contracting Parties shall make available the public funds referred to in Article 3 (b) (iii) shall be determined as follows:

(ii) as to 50% on the basis of the ratio between the thermal power of the reactors situated in the territory of each Contracting Party and the total thermal power of the reactors situated in the territories of all the Contracting Parties. This calculation shall be made on the basis of the thermal power of the reactors shown at the date of the nuclear incident in the list referred to in Article 2 (a) (i); provided that a reactor shall only be taken into consideration for the purposes of this calculation as from the date when it first reaches criticality.
b)For the purposes of this Convention, "thermal power" means:

c)Such particulars shall indicate:
(i)in the case of all installations not yet completed, the expected date on which the risk of a nuclear incident will exist;
(ii) and further, in the case of reactors, the expected date on which they will first reach criticality, and also their thermal power.
d)Each Contracting Party shall also communicate to the Belgian Government the exact date of the existence of the risk of a nuclear incident and in the case of reactors, the date on which they first reached criticality.
e)Each Contracting Party shall also communicate to the Belgian Government all modifications to be made to the list. Where such modifications include the addition of a nuclear installation, the communication must be made at least three months before the expected date on which the risk of a nuclear incident will exist.
f)If a Contracting Party is of the opinion that the particulars, or any modification to be made to the list, communicated by another Contracting Party do not comply with the provisions of Article 2 (a) (i) and of this Article, it may raise objections thereto only by addressing them to the Belgian Government within three months from the date on which it has received notice pursuant to paragraph (h) of this Article.
g)If a Contracting Party is of the opinion that a communication required in accordance with this Article has not been made within the time prescribed in this Article, it may raise objections only by addressing them to the Belgian Government within three months from the date on which it knew of the facts which, in its opinion, ought to have been communicated.
h)The Belgian Government shall give notice as soon as possible to each Contracting Party of the communications and objections which it has received pursuant to this Article.
i)The list referred to in Article 2 (a) (i) shall consist of all the particulars and modifications referred to in paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Article, it being understood that objections submitted pursuant to paragraphs (f) and (g) of this Article shall have effect retrospective to the date on which they were raised, if they are sustained.

b)Any such provisions made by a Contracting Party pursuant to Articles 2, 7 (c) and 9 of the Paris Convention as a result of which the public funds referred to in Article 3 (b) (ii) and (iii) are required to be made available may not be invoked against any other Contracting Party unless it has consented thereto.
c)Nothing in this Convention shall prevent a Contracting Party from making provisions outside the scope of the Paris Convention and of this Convention, provided that such provisions shall not involve any further obligation on the part of the other Contracting Parties in so far as their public funds are concerned.
Article 15
a)Any Contracting Party may conclude an agreement with a State which is not a Party to this Convention concerning compensation out of public funds for damage caused by a nuclear incident.
b)To the extent that the conditions for payment of compensation under any such agreement are not more favourable than those which result from measures adopted by the Contracting Party concerned for the application of the Paris Convention and of this Convention, the amount of damage caused by a nuclear incident covered by this Convention and for which compensation is payable by virtue of such an agreement may be taken into consideration, where the proviso to Article 8 applies, in calculating the total amount of damage caused by that incident.

Annex
to the Convention Supplementary to the Paris Convention of 29 July 1960 on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy
The Governments of the Contracting Parties declare that compensation for damage caused by a nuclear incident not covered by the Supplementary Convention solely by reason of the fact that the relevant nuclear installation, on account of its utilization, is not on the list referred to in Article 2 of the Supplementary Convention, (including the case where such installation considered by one or more but not all of the Governments to be outside the Paris Convention):
