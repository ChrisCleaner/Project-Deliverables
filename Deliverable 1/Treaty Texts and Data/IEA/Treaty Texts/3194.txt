The Contracting Parties
The Governments of the Republic of Kenya, the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Uganda, referred to below as the Parties;
Recognizing the efforts made by the three States to strengthen regional co-operation in the spirit of the Agreement for the Establishment of a Permanent Tripartite Commission for the Co- operation among them signed in Arusha on 30th November 1993;
Aware of the environmental importance of Lake Victoria and its significance to the sustainable development of the three riparian countries;
Concerned that the present level of exploitation of the fisheries resources of Lake Victoria may be close to the limits of the sustainable yield of the lake fishery;
Further concerned that increased agricultural and urban run- off, discharge of domestic and industrial waste into Lake Victoria adversely affects the ecological system of the Lake;
Recognizing that the conversion of wetland areas around Lake Victoria for agricultural and/or other uses may have a detrimental effect on the lake ecosystem;
Noting that significant changes have occurred as regards fish stocks within Lake Victoria with some of the indigenous species facing depletion;
Agreeing that regional co-operation is an essential component of the environmental management of the Lake, and being in the process of establishing the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization to jointly manage the fishery resources of the Lake;
Recognizing that poverty is both a cause and a consequence of environmental degradation and must therefore be addressed adequately in order to enhance equitable and sustainable development among riparian communities;
Desirous to maximize the benefits accruing to the riparian countries from integrated and sustainable utilization of Lake Victoria resources and the conservation of a global natural heritage;
Recognizing that integrated management of the various resources which constitute the lake environment, is essential;
Accepting that the environmental management of Lake Victoria will require a sustained long-term effort based on a comprehensive programme addressing the various problems; and to this end requires national capacity building by using and strengthening existing institutions to conduct on a sustainable basis ongoing and additional functions under a regional programme.
Have agreed as follows
