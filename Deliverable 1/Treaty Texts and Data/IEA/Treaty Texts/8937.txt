Decision // Amendment
SC-8/10: // Listing of decabromodiphenyl ether
SC-8/11: // Listing of short-chain chlorinated paraffins
SC-8/12: // Listing of hexachlorobutadiene
In accordance with paragraphs 3 (b) and 3 (c) and paragraph 4 of article 22 of the Convention, any Party that is unable to accept an amendment to Annex A, B or C shall so notify the depositary, in writing, within one year from the date of communication by the depositary of the adoption of the amendment.

1. Decides to amend part I of Annex A to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants to list decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) present in commercial decabromodiphenyl ether therein, with specific exemptions for the production and use of commercial decabromodiphenyl ether, by inserting the following row:
[note: for original table see source document above]
Chemical // Activity // Specific exemption

Use // In accordance with Part IX of this Annex:
• Parts for use in vehicles specified in paragraph 2 of Part IX of this Annex
• Aircraft for which type approval has been applied for before December 2018 and has been received before December 2022 and spare parts for those aircraft
• Textile products that require anti-flammable characteristics, excluding clothing and toys 
• Additives in plastic housings and parts used for heating home appliances, irons, fans, immersion heaters that contain or are in direct contact with electrical parts or are required to comply with fire retardancy standards, at concentrations lower than 10 per cent by weight of the part
• Polyurethane foam for building insulation
