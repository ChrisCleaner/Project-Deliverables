The Contracting Parties to this Protocol,
Being Contracting Parties to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region, done at Cartagena de Indias on 24 March 1983,
Conscious that oil exploration, production and refining activities, as well as related marine transport, pose a threat of significant oil spills in the wider Caribbean region,
Aware that the islands of the region are particularly vulnerable, owing to the fragility of their ecosystems and the economic reliance of certain of them on the continuous utilization of their coastal areas, to damage resulting from significant oil pollution,
Recognizing that, in the event of an oil spill or the threat thereof, prompt and effective action should be taken initially at the national level, to organize and co-ordinate prevention, mitigation and clean-up activities,
Recognizing further the importance of sound preparation, co-operation and mutual assistance in responding effectively to oil spills or the threat thereof,
Determined to avert, through the adoption of measures to prevent and combat pollution resulting from oil spills, damage to the marine environment, including coastal areas, of the Wider Caribbean Region,
Have agreed as follows:
