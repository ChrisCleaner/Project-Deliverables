ANNEX
AMENDMENTS TO THE CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF SHIPS CARRYING DANGEROUS CHEMICALS IN BULK (BCH CODE)
1.4 Definitions
A new definition should be added as follows:
"1.4.16.C "Anniversary date" means the day and the month of each year which will correspond to the date of expiry of the Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk."
1.6 Survey requirements
The existing title is replaced by the following:
"Survey and certification"
The existing text of section 1.6 should be replaced by the following:
"1.6.1 Survey procedure
1.6.1.1 The survey of ships, so far as regards the enforcement of the provisions of the regulations and granting of exemptions therefrom, should be carried out by officers of the Administration. The Administration may, however, entrust the surveys either to surveyors nominated for the purpose or to organizations recognized by it.
1.6.1.2 The Administration nominating surveyors or recognizing organizations to conduct surveys should, as a minimum, empower any nominated surveyor or recognized organization to:
.1 require repairs to a ship; and
.2 carry out surveys if requested by the appropriate authorities of a port State.
The Administration should notify the Organization of the specific responsibilities of the nominated surveyors or recognized organizations and of the conditions of the authority delegated to them for circulation to the Contracting Governments.
1.6.1.3 When a nominated surveyor or recognized organization determines that the condition of the ship or its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk, or is such that the ship is not fit to proceed to sea without danger to the ship, or persons on board, or without presenting unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment, such surveyor or organization should immediately ensure that corrective action is taken and should in due course notify the Administration. If such corrective action is not taken, the Certificate should be withdrawn and the Administration should be notified immediately; and, if the ship is in a port of another Contracting Government, the appropriate authorities of the port State should also be notified immediately. When an officer of the Administration, a nominated surveyor or a recognized organization has notified the appropriate authorities of the port State, the Government of the port State concerned should give such officer, surveyor or organization any necessary assistance to carry out their obligations under this paragraph. When applicable, the Government of the port State concerned should take such steps as will ensure that the ship does not sail until it can proceed to sea or leave the port for the purpose of proceeding to the nearest appropriate repair yard available without danger to the ship or persons on board or without presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment.
1.6.1.4 In every case, the Administration should guarantee the completeness and efficiency of the survey, and should undertake to ensure the necessary arrangements to satisfy this obligation.
1.6.2 Survey requirements
1.6.2.1 The structure, equipment, fittings, arrangements and material (other than items in respect of which a Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate, Cargo Ship Safety Equipment Certificate and Cargo Ship Safety Radio Certificate or Cargo Ship Safety Certificate are issued) of a chemical tanker should be subjected to the following surveys:
.1 an initial survey before the ship is put in service or before the Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk is issued for the first time, which should include a complete examination of its structure, equipment, fittings, arrangements and material in so far as the ship is covered by the Code. This survey should be such as to ensure that the structure, equipment, fittings, arrangements and material fully comply with the applicable provisions of the Code;
.2 a renewal survey at intervals specified by the Administration, but not exceeding 5 years, except where 1.6.6.2.2, 1.6.6.5, 1.6.6.6 or 1.6.6.7 is applicable. The renewal survey should be such as to ensure that the structure, equipment, fittings, arrangements and material fully comply with the applicable provisions of the Code;
.3 an intermediate survey within 3 months before or after the second anniversary date or within 3 months before or after the third anniversary date of the Certificate which should take the place of one of the annual surveys specified in 1.6.2.1.4. The intermediate survey should be such as to ensure that the safety equipment and other equipment, and associated pump and piping systems fully comply with the applicable provisions of the Code and are in good working order. Such intermediate surveys should be endorsed on the Certificate issued under 1.6.4 or 1.6.5;
.4 an annual survey within 3 months before or after each anniversary date of the Certificate, including a general inspection of the structure, equipment, fittings, arrangements and material referred to in 1.6.2.1.1 to ensure that they have been maintained in accordance with 1.6.3 and that they remain satisfactory for the service for which the ship is intended. Such annual surveys should be endorsed on the Certificate issued under 1.6.4 or 1.6.5;
.5 an additional survey, either general or partial according to the circumstances, should be made when required after an investigation prescribed in 1.6.3.3, or whenever any important repairs or renewals are made. Such a survey should ensure that the necessary repairs or renewals have been effectively made, that the material and workmanship of such repairs or renewals are satisfactory; and that the ship is fit to proceed to sea without danger to the ship or persons on board or without presenting unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment.
1.6.3 Maintenance of conditions after survey
1.6.3.1 The condition of the ship and its equipment should be maintained to conform with the provisions of the Code to ensure that the ship will remain fit to proceed to sea without danger to the ship or persons on board or without presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment.
1.6.3.2 After any survey of the ship under 1.6.2 has been completed, no change should be made in the structure, equipment, fittings, arrangements and material covered by the survey, without the sanction of the Administration, except by direct replacement.
1.6.3.3 Whenever an accident occurs to a ship or a defect is discovered, either of which affects the safety of the ship or the efficiency or completeness of its life-saving appliances or other equipment covered by the Code, the master or owner of the ship should report at the earliest opportunity to the Administration, the nominated surveyor or recognized organization responsible for issuing the Certificate, who should cause investigations to be initiated to determine whether a survey, as required by 1.6.2.1.5, is necessary. If the ship is in a port of another Contracting Government, the master or owner should also report immediately to the appropriate authorities of the port State and the nominated surveyor or recognized organization should ascertain that such a report has been made.
1.6.4 Issue or endorsement of Certificate of Fitness
1.6.4.1 A Certificate called a Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk, should be issued after an initial or renewal survey to a chemical tanker engaged in international voyages which complies with the relevant provisions of the Code.
1.6.4.2 The Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk should be drawn up in the form corresponding to the model given in the appendix. If the language is neither English nor French, the text should include the translation into one of these languages.
1.6.4.3 The Certificate issued under provisions of this section should be available on board for examination at all times.
1.6.4.4 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the amendments to this Code adopted by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) by Resolution MEPC.41(29) and the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) by Resolution MSC.18(58), any Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk, which is current when these amendments enter into force, should remain valid until it expires under the terms of this Code prior to the amendments entering into force.
1.6.5 Issue or endorsement of Certificate of Fitness by another Government
1.6.5.1 A Party to MARPOL 73/78 may, at the request of another Party, cause a ship entitled to fly the flag of the other State to be surveyed and, if satisfied that the provisions of the Code are complied with, issue or authorize the issue of the Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk to the ship, and, where appropriate, endorse or authorize the endorsement of the Certificate on board the ship in accordance with the Code. Any Certificate so issued should contain a statement to the effect that it has been issued at the request of the Government of the State whose flag the ship is entitled to fly.
1.6.6 Duration and validity of Certificate of Fitness
1.6.6.1 A Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk should be issued for a period specified by the Administration which should not exceed 5 years.
1.6.6.2.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of 1.6.6.1, when the renewal survey is completed within 3 months before the expiry date of the existing Certificate, the new Certificate should be valid from the date of completion of the renewal survey to a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of expiry of the existing Certificate.
1.6.6.2.2 When the renewal survey is completed after the expiry date of the existing Certificate, the new Certificate should be valid from the date of completion of the renewal survey to a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of expiry of the existing Certificate.
1.6.6.2.3 When the renewal survey is completed more than 3 months before the expiry date of the existing Certificate. the new Certificate should be valid from the date of completion of the renewal survey to a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of completion of the renewal survey.
1.6.6.3 If a Certificate is issued for a period of less than 5 years, the Administration may extend the validity of the Certificate beyond the expiry date to the maximum period specified in 1.6.6.1, provided that the surveys referred to in 1.6.2.1.3 and 1.6.2.1.4 applicable, when a Certificate is issued for a period of 5 years, are carried out as appropriate.
1.6.6.4 If a renewal survey has been completed and a new Certificate cannot be issued or placed on board the ship before the expiry date of the existing Certificate, the person or organization authorized by the Administration may endorse the existing Certificate and such a Certificate should be accepted as valid for a further period which should not exceed 5 months from the expiry date.
1.6.6.5 If a ship, at the time when a Certificate expires, is not in a port in which it is to be surveyed, the Administration may extend the period of validity of the Certificate but this extension should be granted only for the purpose of allowing the ship to complete its voyage to the port in which it is to be surveyed, and then only in cases where it appears proper and reasonable to do so. No Certificate should be extended for a period longer than 3 months, and a ship to which an extension is granted should not, on its arrival in the port in which it is to be surveyed, be entitled by virtue of such extension to leave that port without having a new Certificate. When the renewal survey is completed, the new Certificate should be valid to a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of expiry of the existing Certificate before the extension was granted.
1.6.6.6 A Certificate issued to a ship engaged on short voyages which has not been extended under the foregoing provisions of this section may be extended by the Administration for a period of grace of up to one month from the date of expiry stated on it. When the renewal survey is completed, the new Certificate should be valid to a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of expiry of the existing Certificate before the extension was granted.
1.6.6.7 In special circumstances, as determined by the Administration, a new Certificate need not be dated from the date of expiry of the existing Certificate as required by 1.6.6.2.2, 1.6.6.5 or 1.6.6.6. In these special circumstances, the new Certificate should be valid to a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of completion of the renewal survey.
1.6.6.8 If an annual or intermediate survey is completed before the period specified in 1.6.2, then:
.1 the anniversary date shown on the Certificate should be amended by endorsement to a date which should not be more than 3 months later than the date on which the survey was completed;
.2 the subsequent annual or intermediate survey required by 1.6.2 should be completed at the intervals prescribed by that section using the new anniversary date;
.3 the expiry date may remain unchanged provided one or more annual or intermediate surveys, as appropriate, are carried out so that the maximum intervals between the surveys prescribed by 1.6.2 are not exceeded.
1.6.6.9 A Certificate issued under 1.6.4 or 1.6.5 should cease to be valid in any of the following cases:
.1 if the relevant surveys are not completed within the periods specified under 1.6.2;
.2 if the Certificate is not endorsed in accordance with 1.6.2.1.3 or 1.6.2.1.4;
.3 upon transfer of the ship to the flag of another State. A new Certificate should only be issued when the Government issuing the new Certificate is fully satisfied that the ship is in compliance with the requirements of 1.6.3.1 and 1.6.3.2. In the case of a transfer between Parties, if requested within 3 months after the transfer has taken place, the Government of the Party whose flag the ship was formerly entitled to fly should, as soon as possible, transmit to the Administration copies of the Certificate carried by the ship before the transfer and, if available, copies of the relevant survey reports.
