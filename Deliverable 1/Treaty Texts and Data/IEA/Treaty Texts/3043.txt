Such obligations shall be without prejudice to the more specific obligations accepted under this Protocol.
Article III
Each Contracting State shall ensure that in the Protocol Area under its jurisdiction any offshore operation shall be conducted under a licence, which may be granted subject to such conditions for the protection of the marine environment and coastal areas as the Competent State Authority sees fit to impose. The Competent State Authority shall require the operator to comply with relevant laws and regulations issued under the authority of the State, and shall have the power to take such measures as are necessary to enforce compliance therewith.
Article IV
1. Each Contracting State shall take measures to ensure the following:
a) Before licensing any offshore operation which could cause significant risks of pollution in the Protocol Area or any adjacent coastal area, the Competent State Authority shall call for submission of an assessment of the potential environmental effects thereof. No such operation shall commence until a statement of those effects has been submitted, and no licence shall be granted until the Competent State Authority is satisfied that the operation will entail no unacceptable risk of such damage in the Protocol Area or any adjacent coastal area.
b) In deciding to call for an environmental impact statement, and in determining its scope, the Competent State Authority shall have regard to the Guidelines issued by the Organization.
c) Whenever a Competent State Authority has called for and received an environmental impact statement, it shall send to the Organization a summary of the potential environmental effects referred to in that statement. The Organization shall, within four days of its receipt, despatch copies of that summary to all the other Contracting States. The Competent State Authority before granting a licence for the proposed operation, shall allow all other Contracting States to submit representations to it through the Organization within a stated time which shall be reasonable taking into account the type of operation and the urgency of the need for a decision. It shall consider any such representations before licensing the said operation.
Notwithstanding the obligation to send a summary to the Organization, the Contracting State shall have the right to withhold information which might prejudice its national security.
2. Whenever a Contracting State does not call for an assessment of the environmental impact of a proposed offshore operation, it shall consider calling for a survey of the marine environment and the aquatic life therein to be made before the start of the proposed operation. The survey is to be carried out by or under the direct supervision of a body independent of the operator and approved by the Competent State Authority.
3. The Guidelines on Environmental Impact Assessment to be issued by the Organization shall contain guidance on the type of operation, and the circumstances in which it would cause significant risk of pollution in the Protocol Area or any adjacent coastal area.
Article V
1. Each Contracting State shall endeavour to ensure that offshore operations within its jurisdiction shall not cause unjustifiable interference with lawful navigation, fishing or any other activity carried on under a bilateral or multilateral agreement or on the basis of international law, and that in siting an installation, due regard shall be had to existing pipelines and cables. Regard shall also be had to the need for protecting sites of special ecological and cultural interests.
2. Each Contracting State shall take steps to ensure that, within the area of its jurisdiction, operators of offshore installations survey the sea-bed in the vicinity of their installations, and remove any debris resulting from their operations which might interfere with lawful fishing:
a) in the case of a pipeline, or other sub-sea apparatus immediately following completion of the work of installation;
b) in the case of a production platform, immediately following its removal;
c) in any case when the Competent State Authority might reasonably require survey and clean-up.
Article VI
Each Contracting State shall take all practicable measures to ensure that every offshore installation to be used in that part of the Protocol Area within its jurisdiction is certified by a Certifying Authority or its designer that it is safe and fit for the purpose for which it is to be used so as to ensure that it will not cause accidental damage to the marine environment.
Article VII
Each Contracting State shall take all practicable measures to ensure the following:
1. Operators shall at all times have available to their offshore installations, in good working order, equipment and devices to minimize the risk of accidental pollution and to facilitate prompt response to a pollution emergency, in accordance with good oilfield or other relevant industry practice.
2. Any such plant or equipment not included as part of an installation for the purposes of Article VI shall be subject to prior examination and approval by or on behalf of the Competent State Authority, and to periodic inspection, in accordance with good oilfield or other relevant industry practice.
3. Blow-out preventers and other safety equipment shall be tested periodically by the operator or on his behalf, and exercises in their operation carried out periodically, in accordance with good oilfield or other relevant industry practice.
4. Offshore installations above sea level shall carry lights and other warning instruments, in accordance with international maritime practice, maintained in good working order, and those lights and instruments shall also be operated in accordance with international maritime practice.
5. All persons engaged in offshore operations shall have had or be given training in accordance with good oilfield practice. Any person employed on an offshore installation for the first time shall undergo an induction course, and shall be given a manual which includes instruction on emergency procedures.
Article VIII
Each Contracting State shall take all practicable measures to ensure the following:
1. No operator shall start work on any stage of his offshore operations within its jurisdiction until he has:
a) prepared a Contingency Plan to deal with any event which may occur as a result of the operations, and which may cause significant pollution to the marine environment;
b) had that plan approved by the Competent State Authority;
c) shown to the satisfaction of that State authority that he has available to him sufficient expertise and resources to put that Plan fully into operation.
2. No Contingency Plan shall be approved unless it can be co-ordinated with any existing national or local Contingency Plans, and any Plans prepared by the Centre, and unless the operator can be required to participate in any exercise conducted in the implementation of such Contingency Plans.
3. Any person conducting offshore operations shall make and maintain arrangements to ensure that when an event occurs as a result of his operations which may cause significant pollution of the marine environment, a full report of that event is sent immediately to the State authority designated to receive such reports.
4. The respective roles and powers of the industry and the authorities shall be fully understood before an oil spill emergency, and shall be clearly defined in the operator's Contingency Plan, and in any national and local Contingency Plans.
Article IX
Each Contracting State shall take all practicable measures to ensure, subject to paragraph 2 below, the following:
a) In that part of the Protocol Area which is a 'Special Area', no machinery space drainage from an offshore installation shall be discharged into the sea unless the oil content thereof does not exceed 15 mg per litre whilst undiluted. Any Contracting State may impose a more restrictive level in any area under its jurisdiction.
b) No other discharge from an offshore installation into the sea within the Protocol Area, except one derived from drilling operations, shall have an oil content, whilst undiluted, greater than that stipulated for the time being by the Organization. The oil content so stipulated shall not be greater than 40 mg per litre as an average in any calendar month, and shall not at any time exceed 100 mg per litre.
c) Discharge points for oily wastes shall be well below the surface of the sea as appropriate.
d) All necessary precautions shall be taken to minimize losses of oil into the sea from oil and gas collected or flared from well testing.
2. Measures passed in compliance with paragraph 1 of this Article may provide that there is no breach of their requirements if, when the oil content of a discharge is greater than the permitted concentrations, that excess was due to some accident or other cause beyond the control of the operator and his employees, and that they took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid such excess. Alternatively, a defence of equivalent effect may be provided.
3. Each Contracting State shall ensure that the operator may be required to conduct surveys of environmental conditions in the vicinity of his offshore installation, periodically or on such occasions as the Competent State Authority may reasonably require.
The State itself may conduct or have conducted such a survey. If, without apparent reason, the results of that survey show a significant difference from the results of the operator's most recent survey, without prejudice to any other legal action, the State may charge the cost of its own survey to the operator.
4. Each Contracting State shall pass measures necessary to ensure the following:
a) Oil-based drilling fluids shall not be used in drilling operations in those parts of the Protocol Area within its jurisdiction except with the express sanction of the Competent State Authority. Such sanction shall not be given unless the Authority is satisfied that the use of such fluid is justified because of exceptional circumstances. If such fluid is used, the drill cuttings shall be effectively treated to minimize their oil content before being appropriately disposed of. Any wash waters shall not be discharged at any place from which they may be carried to mix with the same drill cuttings. The discharge point for the cuttings shall, as appropriate, be well below the surface of the water.
b) No oil-based drilling fluid shall be discharged to any parts of the Protocol Area within its jurisdiction.
c) Water-based drilling muds discharged from off-shore operations must not contain persistent systematic toxins which may continue to pose an environmental threat after the initial drilling fluid discharge.

a) Disposal into the sea of the following is prohibited:
i) all plastics, including but not limited to synthetic ropes, synthetic fishing nets and plastic garbage bags;
ii) all other garbage, including paper products, rags, glass, metal, bottles, crockery, dunnage, lining and packing materials;
b) Disposal into the sea of food wastes shall be made as far as practicable from land, but in any case not less than 12 nautical miles from the nearest land.
c) When the garbage is mixed with other discharges having different disposal or discharge requirements the more severe requirements shall apply.
d) Sewage shall not be discharged into the Protocol Area from an installation permanently manned by ten or more persons unless:
i) it has been comminuted and disinfected using a system approved by the Competent State Authority and is discharged at a distance of more than four nautical miles from the nearest land; or
ii) it is discharged at a distance of more than twelve nautical miles from the nearest land; or
iii) it has passed through a treatment plant approved by the Competent State Authority;
and in any case the discharge does not produce visible floating solids or discolouration of the surrounding water.
2. Each Contracting State shall provide at convenient points on its coastline, reception facilities for general garbage from manned offshore installations operating in the area of its jurisdiction.
Article XI
1. Each Contracting State shall take all appropriate measures to ensure the following:
a) Each operator of an offshore installation shall prepare, and submit for approval by the Competent State Authority, a "Chemical Use Plan". Application for amendments to the Plan may be submitted subsequently and approved. If at any time he wishes to use a chemical outside the scope of his approved Plan, and that chemical may escape into the marine environment, he shall notify the Competent State Authority, except that in case of emergency to prevent the risk of injury to person or extensive damage to property, the notification need not be given prior to the use of the chemical.
b) The Competent State Authority has a power to prohibit, limit or regulate the use of a chemical or product and to impose conditions on its storage and its use, for the purpose of protecting the marine environment. In exercising that power, the Authority shall have regard to any Guidelines issued by the Organization.
2. Each Contracting State shall take appropriate measures to ensure that seismic operations in the Protocol Area shall take into account the Guidelines issued by the Organization.
Article XII
Each Contracting State shall require that, for offshore operations in any part of the Protocol Area within its jurisdiction, the operator shall:
1. provide adequate systems for collection and proper disposal of all unwanted substances or articles;
2. give proper instructions on their use;
3. endeavour to provide for penalties for improper disposal.
Article XIII
1. Each Contracting State shall ensure that the Competent Authority has the power to require the operator of an offshore installation:
a) in the case of a pipeline -
i) to flush and remove any residual pollutants from the pipeline, and
