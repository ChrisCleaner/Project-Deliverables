NORWEGIAN ORDINANCE, containing Regulations for the Establishment of a Close Time for Seal Fishery by Norwegian Vessels in the Arctic Sea, Christiania, October 28, 1876 (Translation)
Source: 70 BFSP 368.
We, Oscar, by the grace of God King of Sweden and Norway, the Wends and Goths, hereby make known, in virtue of the Law of this 18th of May last [Ed: see above, 70 BFSP page 367], establishing a close time for seals in the Arctic Seas, with reference to Sections 2 and 3 of the said Law, that, in the seas between 67* and 75* north latitude, and between 5° east and 17* west longitude from Greenwich meridian, it shall be forbidden until further notice for any Norwegian ship or Norwegian subject to hunt or take seal, including the Cystophora cristata, earlier in the year than the 3rd of April.

ORDINANCE of the King of Sweden and Norway, to establish a Close time for the Seal Fishery by Swedish Vessels in the Arctic Seas, Stockholm, November 30, 1876 (Translation)
Source: 70 BFSP 513.
We, Oscar, by the grace of God King of Sweden and Norway, of the Goths and the Wends, make known that, considering that the seal fisheries in the Arctic Seas, especially in the neighbourhood of Jan Mayen's Island, are conducted in such a manner as to threaten the extermination of the seal in those waters, and the total destruction of the fisheries, negotiation's have been initiated by our Kingdom of Norway with the Governments of those foreign countries whose inhabitants take part in the said fisheries, and those Governments having heir promulgated, or declared their willingness to promulgate, suitable ordinances to the above effect, and seeing that a certain small number of Swedish ships also take part in the fisheries, and that, in so far as these ordinances are calculated to work the desired effect, it is essential that, as has already been ordained elsewhere, the liability for their violations should be of such a character as to outweight the benefit to be derived from a breach of the law, we have now thought it right, in so far as Sweden is concerned, to participate in the said agreement, and we have therefore graciously ordained as follows:
§1. In the Arctic Seas, between 67* and 75° North latitude and 5* east 17* west longitude from Greenwich, all Swedish ships and all Swedish subjects are forbidden until further notice to kill or catch seal (including the Phoca cristata) earlier in the year than the 3rd of April.
§2. All persons infringing the regulations contained in the foregoing paragraph, or being in any Manner parties to such infringement, will be liable to a fine of from 200 to 10,000 kronor, with the proviso that, should the said infringement have taken place either in obedience to the orders of the captain of the ship or with his knowledge, or without his having done everything in his power to guard against it, he alone of all the crew shall be liable to the penalty incurred. Of the fines imposed, half goes to the informer and half to the Crown. Failing means to meet the fine, the corresponding legal penalty shall be enforced.
§3. In cases of violation of the prescriptions of this Ordinance, jurisdiction lies with the ordinary Courts.
Let this be obediently observed by all whom it may concern. For further certainty, we have hereunto affixed our hand and seal.
(L.S.) Oscar
