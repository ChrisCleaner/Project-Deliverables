The Contracting Parties,
Conscious of the importance of fisheries as an essential sector of their national development and their contribution towards food security;
Attaching importance to the sustainable development of fisheries and aquaculture;
Recognising that most of the countries in Eastern and Central Europe would benefit greatly from the development of their fisheries which may partly depend on the establishment of international market information and technical advisory services for fishery products, since this would lead to a more balanced supply situation on the markets, promote a more regular pattern of prices and encourage the best use to be made of fishery resources;
Recognising also the need for the countries in Eastern and Central Europe to be assisted in developing their fisheries industry and in strengthening the investments capacity especially of the private sector;
Realising that the promotion and success of such services can be facilitated through regional co-operation;
Considering that the said co-operation can be achieved through the establishment of an international organisation bringing together countries in transition and developed countries and carrying out its activities with countries, organisations and institutions;
Considering further that such an organisation could constitute a forum for the countries concerned to initiate post-harvest fisheries and aquaculture activities as well as common actions in the fields of investment and development, trade and market promotion.

2. Subject to paragraph 3 below, each Member shall have one vote. Decisions of the Governing Council shall be taken by a majority of the votes cast. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, a majority of the total membership of the Governing Council shall constitute a quorum. However, as far as possible, decisions of the Governing Council will be taken by consensus.
3. A Regional Economic Integration Organisation that is a Member of EUROFISH shall be entitled to exercise in any meeting of the Governing Council or of any subsidiary body of the Organisation a number of votes equal to the number of its Member States that are entitled to vote in such meeting.
4. A Regional Economic Integration Organisation that is a Member of the Organisation shall exercise its membership rights on an alternative basis with its Member States that are Members of the Organisation in the areas of their respective competence. Whenever a Regional Economic Integration Organisation that is a Member of EUROFISH exercises its right to vote, its Member States shall not exercise theirs, and conversely.

Any Member of EUROFISH may request a Regional Economic Integration Organisation that is a Member of the Organisation or its Member States that are Members of EUROFISH to provide information as to which, as between the Member Organisation and its Member States, has competence in respect of any specific question.

Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Regional Economic Integration Organisation that is a Member of EUROFISH or its Member States that are Members of the Organisation from making a single declaration for the purpose of this paragraph, which declaration shall remain in force for questions and agenda items to be considered at all subsequent meetings subject to such exceptions or modifications as may be indicated before any individual meeting.

In cases where an agenda item covers both matters in respect of which competence has been transferred to the Regional Economic Integration Organisation and matters which lie within the competence of its Member States, both the Regional Economic Integration Organisation and its Member States may participate in the discussions. In such cases, the meeting, in arriving at its decisions, shall take into account only the intervention of the Member which has the right to vote.

To this end, EUROFISH shall charge for the services it grants at rates set by the Governing Council with a view to the revenue thus derived covering the operating costs and administrative expenses of EUROFISH, and replacement of operating assets.
4. A Member which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to EUROFISH shall have no vote in the Governing Council if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of its due contributions for the two preceding calendar years. The Governing Council may, nevertheless, permit such a Member to vote if it is satisfied that the failure to pay is due to conditions beyond the control of the Member.
Article 12
LEGAL STATUS, PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES
1. EUROFISH shall possess juridical personality and such legal capacity as may be necessary for the fulfilment of the Organisation's objectives and for the exercise of its functions.
2. The representatives of Members and the Director and staff of EUROFISH shall be accorded the privileges and immunities necessary for the independent exercise of their functions with the Organisation.
3. Each Member shall accord the status, privileges and immunities referred to above in the following manner:
(a) In the territory of each Member which has acceded to the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialised Agencies in respect of FAO, those which are stipulated therein, mutatis mutandis;
(b) In the territory of each Member which has not acceded to the above Convention in respect of FAO but which has acceded to the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, those which are stipulated therein, mutatis mutandis, unless the Member notifies the Director-General of FAO when signing the Agreement or at the time of the deposit of its instrument of ratification or accession, that it will not apply the said Convention in which case that Member shall, within six months thereafter, conclude an agreement with EUROFISH granting a status and privileges and immunities comparable to those provided for in the said Convention;
(c) If a Member has not acceded to either of the above conventions, it shall, within six months of the signature of the Agreement or of the deposit of its instrument of ratification or accession, conclude an agreement with EUROFISH granting a status and privileges and immunities comparable to those provided for in the said conventions.
4. Privileges and immunities are accorded to the representatives of Members and the Director and staff of EUROFISH not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves, but in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation. Consequently, a Member or the Director, as the case may be, not only has the right but is under a duty to waive the immunity of its representatives or of a staff member in any case where, in the opinion of the Member or of the Director, the immunity would impede the course of justice, and where it can be waived without prejudice to the purpose for which the immunity is accorded. If the Member sending the representative or the Director, as the case may be, does not waive the immunity of the representative or the staff member, the Member or the Director shall make the strongest efforts to achieve an equitable solution to the matter.
5. EUROFISH shall conclude a headquarters agreement with the Host State, and may conclude agreements with other States in which offices of the Organisation may be located, specifying the privileges and immunities and facilities to be enjoyed by the Organisation to enable it to fulfil its objectives and to perform its functions.
Article 13
CO-OPERATION WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS
1. The Contracting Parties agree that there should be a working relationship between EUROFISH and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO). To this end EUROFISH shall enter into negotiations with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations with a view to concluding an agreement pursuant to Article XIII of the Constitution of the Organisation. Such agreement should provide, inter alia, for the Director-General of FAO to appoint a Representative who would participate in all meetings of EUROFISH, but without the right to vote.
2. The Contracting Parties agree that there should be co-operation between EUROFISH and other international and regional fisheries organisations and other institutions which might contribute to the work and further the objectives of EUROFISH. EUROFISH may enter into agreements with such organisations and institutions. Such agreements may include, if appropriate, provision for participation by such organisations or institutions in the activities of EUROFISH.
