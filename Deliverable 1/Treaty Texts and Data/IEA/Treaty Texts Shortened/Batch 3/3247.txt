minimal adverse impact environment relative energy applications moreover applications reduce amount capital investment energy development also energy conservation cuts across various energy sectors view this important sub sector increase visibility importance thereforee following sets forth guidelines sub sector encourage development national energy efficiency conservation plans develop increased training opportunities energy efficiency conservation target reduction commercial energy intensity achievable measureable percentage per annum encourage involvement independent energy
