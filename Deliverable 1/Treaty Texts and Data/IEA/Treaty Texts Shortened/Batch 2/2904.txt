multilateral implementation pertinent provisions final act conference security cooperation europe cognizant references chapter environment final act conference security cooperation europe calling cooperation control air pollution effects including long range transport air pollutants development international cooperation extensive programme monitoring evaluation long range transport air pollutants starting sulphur dioxide possible extension pollutants considering pertinent provisions declaration united nations conference human environment particular principle expresses common conviction states have accordance charter united nations principles international law sovereign right exploit resources pursuant environmental policies responsibility ensure activities within jurisdiction control cause damage environment states areas beyond limits national jurisdiction recognizing existence possible adverse effects short long term air pollution including transboundary air pollution concerned rise level emissions air pollutants within region forecast may increase adverse effects recognizing need study implications long range transport air pollutants need seek solutions problems identified affirming willingness reinforce active international cooperation develop appropriate national policies means exchange information consultation research monitoring ordinate national action combating air pollution including long range transboundary air pollution agreed follows article definitions purposes present convention air pollution means introduction man directly indirectly substances energy air resulting deleterious effects nature endanger human health harm living resources ecosystems material property impair interfere amenities legitimate uses environment air pollutants shall construed accordingly long range transboundary air pollution means air pollution whose physical origin situated wholly part within area national jurisdiction one state adverse effects area jurisdiction another state distance generally possible distinguish contribution individual emission sources groups sources article fundamental principles contracting parties taking due account facts problems involved determined protect man environment air pollution shall endeavour limit and far possible gradually reduce prevent air pollution including long range transboundary air pollution article contracting parties within framework present convention shall means exchanges information consultation research monitoring develop without undue delay policies strategies shall serve means combating discharge air pollutants taking account efforts already made national international levels article contracting parties shall exchange information review policies scientific activities technical measures aimed combating far possible discharge air pollutants may adverse effects thereby contributing reduction air pollution including long range transboundary air pollution article consultations shall held upon request early stage between one hand contracting parties actually affected exposed significant risk long range transboundary air pollution and hand contracting parties within subject whose jurisdiction significant contribution long range transboundary air pollution originates could originate connection activities carried contemplated therein article air quality management taking account articles ongoing research exchange information monitoring results thereof cost effectiveness local remedies and order combat air pollution particular originating new rebuilt installations contracting party undertakes develop best policies strategies including air quality management systems and part them control measures compatible balanced development particular using best available technology economically feasible low and non waste technology article research development contracting parties appropriate needs shall initiate operate conduct research and development existing proposed technologies reducing emissions sulphur compounds major air pollutants including technical economic feasibility environmental consequences instrumentation techniques monitoring measuring emission rates ambient concentrations air pollutants improved models better understanding transmission long range transboundary air pollutants effects sulphur compounds major air pollutants

present convention contain rule state liability damage data indicate attributed long range transboundary air pollution national sub regional regional policies strategies control sulphur compounds major air pollutants article implementation development cooperative programme monitoring evaluation long range transmission air pollutants europe contracting parties stress need implementation existing cooperative programme monitoring evaluation long range transmission air pollutants europe hereinafter referred emep and regard development programme agree emphasize desirability contracting parties joining fully implementing emep which first step based monitoring sulphur dioxide related substances need use comparable standardized procedures monitoring whenever possible desirability basing monitoring programme framework national international programmes establishment monitoring stations collection data shall carried national jurisdiction country monitoring stations located desirability establishing framework cooperative environmental monitoring programme based taking account present future national sub regional regional international programmes need exchange data emissions periods time agreed upon agreed air pollutants starting sulphur dioxide coming grid units agreed size fluxes agreed air pollutants starting sulphur dioxide across national borders distances periods time agreed upon method including model used determine fluxes well method including model used determine transmission air pollutants based emissions per grid unit shall made available periodically reviewed order improve methods models willingness continue exchange periodic updating national data total emissions agreed air pollutants starting sulphur dioxide need provide
