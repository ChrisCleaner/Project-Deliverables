application rates good agricultural practices information available data package taken account risk evaluation therefore decision european union efsa conclusion reached basis evaluation representative use european union consequently committee confirms criterion paragraph b iii met committee confirms paragraph criteria met annex ii paragraph criteria consider whether final regulatory action provides sufficiently broad basis merit listing chemical annex iii taking account whether final regulatory action led would expected lead significant decrease quantity chemical used number uses final regulatory action bans use amitrole pesticide european union final regulatory action therefore expected lead significant decrease quantity chemical used resulting significant reduction risk human health environment therefore committee confirms criterion paragraph met ii whether final regulatory action led actual reduction risk would expected result significant reduction risk human health environment party submitted notification expected since regulatory action ban use amitrole significantly reduces quantity chemical used risks human health environment also significantly reduced therefore committee confirms criterion paragraph ii met iii whether considerations led final regulatory action taken applicable limited geographical area limited circumstances notification states similar human health environmental problems likely encountered regions substance used particularly developing countries therefore committee confirms criterion paragraph iii met iv whether evidence ongoing international trade chemical response secretariat request provide information ongoing international trade candidate chemicals chemical review committee fifteenth meeting croplife international confirmed ongoing international trade amitrole unep fao rc crc inf therefore committee confirms criterion paragraph iv met annex ii paragraph criterion take account intentional misuse adequate reason
