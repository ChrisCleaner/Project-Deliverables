information available committee concluded criterion met annex iv part paragraph criterion existence handling applicator restrictions involving technology techniques may reasonably widely applied states lacking necessary infrastructure safe handling pesticides requires proper use appropriate personal protective equipment operators study carried colombia shows farmers follow basic requirement number reasons including climatic conditions lack financial resources addition many farmers able read label instructions due reasons farmers exposed high quantities formulations resulted reported
