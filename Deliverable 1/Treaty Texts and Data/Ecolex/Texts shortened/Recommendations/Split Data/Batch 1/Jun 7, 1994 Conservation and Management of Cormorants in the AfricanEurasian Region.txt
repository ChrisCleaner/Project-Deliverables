convention conservation migratory species wild animals recommendation conservation management cormorants african eurasian region adopted conference parties fourth meeting nairobi june conference parties convention conservation migratory species wild animals pursuant article vii paragraph bonn convention provides conference parties meetings may make recommendations improving conservation status migratory species noting species pygmy cormorant included list specially protected wild fauna species appendix ii species cormorants list protected wild fauna species appendix iii convention conservation european wildlife natural habitats berne convention noting proposals include pygmy cormorant socotra cormorant appendix ii convention conservation migratory species wild animals noting also draft agreement conservation african eurasian migratory waterbirds aware draft agreement covers inter alia migratory species cormorants also aware management plan draft agreement underlines desirability preparing species conservation plans species waterbirds frequently come conflict human interests acknowledging that african eurasian region small population globally threatened species pygmy cormorant phalacrocorax pygmaeus decreasing population trend species socotra cormorant phalacrocorax nigrogularis unknown population trend great cormorant subspecies phalacrocorax carbo carbo presumed overall increasing population trend great cormorant subspecies phalacrocorax carbo sinensis increasing strongly numbers range acknowledging also that cormorants breed dense colonies specially vulnerable breeding season different cormorant species populations may utilize breeding wintering sites persecution phalacrocorax carbo sinensis phalacrocorax carbo carbo breeding colonies continues countries increases populations phalacrocorax carbo carbo phalacrocorax carbo sinensis brought conflicts human interests especially fish farming areas coastal inland water river systems countries increases conflict human activities fish pond areas contribute management conservation habitats waterbirds aware many range states developed national legislative administrative provisions protect wild birds including regularly occurring species migratory birds habitats aware that within european community national provisions relating protection wild birds required implement eec directive conservation wild birds that member states european community national provisions field required consistent principles set directive article directive permits derogations requirement member states community prohibit deliberate killing capture wild birds satisfactory solution order prevent serious damage fisheries certain interests recommends parties non parties convention range states migratory species cormorants take appropriate steps to improve protect conservation status pygmy cormorant improve protect conservation status socotra cormorant maintain favourable conservation status great

conservation issue secure cormorants may killed controlled conditions exchange information sponsorship party range state action taken subparagraphs iv vi vii above working group established report cms scientific council adoption african eurasian waterbird agreement working group agreement established technical committee encourages parties non parties convention range states follow attached guidelines conservation management great cormorant encourages sponsorship party range state range states consider co operate preparation international species conservation plans migrating species cormorants accordance principles draft agreement conservation african eurasian migratory waterbirds taking also consideration guidelines attached present recommendation directs secretariat assist parties range states endeavours appendix guidelines conservation management great cormorant background general increases population great cormorant caused number conflicts human activities many fishermen report species causes damage especially fish farming areas also inland waters along coast conflicts human activities result demands joint guidelines handling conflicts two subspecies great cormorant normally recognized europe nominate subspecies carbo estimated total population least pairs increasing trend subspecies sinensis estimated total population least pairs strongly increasing trend estimates increases also apparent winter quarters increases thought mainly due legal protection species increased food availability due eutrophication water bodies great cormorant breeds dense colonies widespread non breeding period features make especially vulnerable breeding season species needs undisturbed breeding sites possibilities permit site shifting great cormorant reported cause conflicts fishery forestry activities conflicts interests including nature conservation also reported great cormorant protected range states western central northern european countries currently hunting season except sweden norway switzerland legislation range states including states members european community allows control species causes serious damage specified interests satisfactory solutions many different methods control used need exchange knowledge coordination elaboration common guidelines principles range states endeavour maintain favourable conservation status great cormorant appropriate conservation management plan policy developed plan subsequent changes plan communicated secretariat distribution range states number breeding colonies adequate maintain favourable conservation status fully protected countries great cormorant establishes breeding colonies range states undertake regular monitoring great cormorant populations breeding and or non breeding season control species may allowed serious damage specified interests verified satisfactory solutions serious damage however alleviated primarily appropriate management human activities concerned including among others policy support fish farming favourable fauna flora habitats adaptation fishing methods gear scaring techniques intervention within breeding colonies appears necessary may authorized particular cases scientifically demonstrated significant negative impact conservation status cormorants mentioned opening paragraph points above strict supervision accordance principles laid point above control methods respect good ethical principles year extent controls methods used communicated secretariat distribution range states efforts made increase international exchange information concerning damage fisheries including assessment damage alleviation problems range states recognize activities eifac working group iwrb cormorant research group organizations may provide platforms mutual exchange scientific information
