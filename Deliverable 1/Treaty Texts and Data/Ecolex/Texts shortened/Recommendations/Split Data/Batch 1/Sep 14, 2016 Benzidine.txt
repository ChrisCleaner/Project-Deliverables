incidence bladder cancer reported two studies although data limited evidence indicating reduction occupational exposure benzidine associated decrease incidence bladder carcinoma result although environmental exposure general population estimated regulatory measures put place protect health canadians previously allowed use manufacture dyes pigments prohibited regulatory action thereby removing possible route occupational exposure release canadian environment approach consistent objective exposure non threshold carcinogens reduced wherever possible obviates need establish arbitrary
