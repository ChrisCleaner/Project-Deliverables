data generated according scientifically recognized methods ii data reviews performed documented according generally recognized scientific principles procedures detailed review conducted government canada concludes tributyltin compounds toxic aquatic organisms low concentrations high potential cause environmental harm due high persistence bioaccumulative properties follow up ecological risk assessment organotin substances canada s domestic substances list unep fao rc crc inf follow up risk assessment risk quotients calculated basis modelled well measured exposure hazard data internationally applied methodology extensive list references cited follow up risk assessment document wide range sources including well known international journals thus committee established data reviewed risk evaluation generated according scientifically recognized methods data reviews performed according generally recognized scientific principles procedures iii final regulatory action based risk evaluation involving prevailing conditions within party taking action exposure based first concentrations tributyltin compounds water sediment modelled canada and second measured concentrations tributyltin compounds water sediment canada concluded estimated measured concentrations tributyltin compounds canada high enough cause adverse effects sensitive organisms furthermore tributyltin

organisms molluscs appear potential induce sex reversal marine fish risk evaluation took account modelled measured exposure data canada ecotoxicological endpoints tributyltin compounds indicated high risk sensitive aquatic organisms therefore committee concluded criterion met annex ii paragraph criteria consider whether final regulatory action provides sufficiently broad basis merit listing chemical annex iii taking account whether final regulatory action led would expected lead significant decrease quantity chemical used number uses final regulatory action severely restricts use tributyltin compounds industrial chemicals mainly polyvinyl chloride pvc processing industry severe restriction expected lead decrease quantity chemical used consequently reduction environmental risks associated use tributyltin compounds industrial chemicals ii whether final regulatory action led actual reduction risk would expected result significant reduction risk human health environment party submitted notification since regulatory action significantly reduce contamination aquatic environment tributyltin compounds expected lead significant reduction risk environment although persistence aquatic environment locations result elevated levels time removing source input allow recovery occur iii whether considerations led final regulatory action taken applicable limited geographical area limited circumstances similar environmental exposure risks likely found countries tributyltin compounds used industrial chemicals therefore relevance final regulatory action limited canada iv whether evidence ongoing international trade chemical information european union international trade chemicals shows recent information trade european union member states countries unep fao rc crc inf annex ii paragraph criterion take account intentional misuse adequate reason list chemical annex iii indication notification supporting documentation concerns intentional misuse prompted final regulatory
