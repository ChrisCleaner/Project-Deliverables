xinjiang tianshan also outstanding example ongoing biological ecological evolutionary process temperate arid zone altitudinal vegetation distributions significant differences north south slopes diversity flora illustrate biological ecological evolution pamir tian highlands xinjiang tianshan outstanding biodiversity important habitat relic species numerous rare endangered species well endemic species provides excellent example gradual replacement original warm wet flora modern xeric mediterranean flora n criterion vii tianshan large mountain range central asia stretching kilometers largest mountain chain world rsquo s temperate arid region largest isolated east west mountain range globally xinjiang portion tianshan runs east west mountain range outstanding natural beauty xinjiang tianshan anchored west highest peak tianshan tomur peak meters east bogda peak meters range lies two central asian deserts junggar desert north tarim desert south beauty xinjiang tianshan lies spectacular snow capped mountains glacier capped peaks beautiful forests meadows clear rivers lakes red bed canyons also combination contrast mountain elements vast deserts stark difference bare rocks south slope luxuriant forest meadow north creates striking visual contrast environments hot cold dry wet desolate luxuriant ndash exceptional beauty n criterion ix xinjiang tianshan outstanding example ongoing biological ecological evolutionary process temperate arid zone landforms ecosystems preserved since pliocene epoch tianshan rsquo s position two deserts central asian arid continental climate unique among world s mountain ecosystems xinjiang tianshan typical mountain altitudinal zones temperate arid zone reflecting moisture heat variations different altitudes gradients slopes property outstanding example study biological community succession mountain ecosystems arid zone undergoing global climate change xinjiang tianshan also outstanding representative biological ecological evolution pamir tian highlands altitudinal vegetation distributions significant differences north south slopes diversity flora illustrate biological ecological evolution pamir tian highlands property also important habitat relic species numerous rare endangered species well endemic species representative process whereby original warm wet flora gradually replaced modern xeric mediterranean flora n integrity n property serial property consisting four components totaling hectares buffer zones totaling hectares four components include tomur kalajun kuerdening bayinbuluke

category ia property conservation management time tomur peak national nature reserve particular conservation management since broad range environmental natural resource use laws governs property therefore benefits high level legal protection n components management plan management plan also exists property whole new management plan whole property come effect property adequate staff well funded extensive research conducted property giving park staff strong knowledge base work from n special attention needs given ensuring effective management planning coordination across components property geographically well separated other future efforts focus upon opportunities extend add property increase size integrity given overall large scale tianshan mountain range system also consider initiatives neighbouring countries consider transnational opportunities extend protection tianshan system n attention also given working iucn partners better understand implications grazing natural
