valley major tectonic and or volcanic events shaped distinctive landscape world s greatest diversities concentrations bird species recorded within relatively small lake systems year million lesser flamingos move three shallow lakes outstanding wildlife spectacle surrounded hot springs geysers steep escarpment rift valley volcanic outcrops natural setting lakes provides exceptional experience nature n criterion vii kenya lake system presents exceptional range geological biological processes exceptional natural beauty including falls geysers hot springs open waters marshes forests open grasslands concentrated relatively small area set among landscape backdrop great rift valley massed congregations birds shores lakes including million lesser flamingos move three lakes outstanding wildlife spectacle natural setting three lakes surrounded steep escarpment rift valley associated volcanic features provides exceptional experience nature n criterion ix kenya lake system illustrates ongoing ecological biological processes provide valuable insights evolution development soda lake ecosystems related communities plants animals low species diversity abundant resident populations birds animals make soda lakes property especially important environments conduct investigations trophic dynamics ecosystem processes production huge biomass quantities distinctive soda lakes food web green algae supports also international scientific value provide critical support birds visit property large numbers part migration response seasonal episodic changes environment n criterion kenya lake system single important foraging site lesser flamingo world million individuals moving one lake provides main nesting breeding grounds great white pelicans great rift valley lakes terrestrial zones also contain important populations many mammal bird species globally regionally threatened home species migratory birds support globally important populations black necked grebe african spoonbill pied avocet little grebe yellow billed stork black winged stilt grey headed gull gull billed tern property makes critical contribution conservation natural values within great rift valley

significant rift valley lakes within kenya essential component great rift valley whole three components property gazetted protected area whilst property small size contains main ecosystems features support outstanding universal value surrounded area rapidly growing population property considerable threat surrounding pressures threats include siltation soil erosion increased abstraction water catchment degradation land deforestation growth human settlements overgrazing wildlife management tourism pollution coming nakuru town management authorities must vigilant continuing address issues effective multi sector participatory planning processes n protection management requirements n component property enjoys adequate legal protection up to date management plans satisfactory on ground management presence order maintain enhance outstanding universal value property important sustain enhance effective management address range long term issues include catchment level management threats development particular emphasis management groundwater surface pollution forest cover inter sectoral participatory management processes especially respect environmental impact assessment adjoin development building increased ecological connectivity component parts system transboundary cooperation also important values property partly dependant protection lake wetland areas support migratory species regard potential areas including lake natron tanzania considered part future transnational serial world heritage property n nbsp n commends state party significant efforts improve conservation property reduce impacts surrounding land use effective management development threats within lake catchments n also commends state party decision abort proposed landfill development close lake nakuru national park order avoid impact keep open options ecological connectivity lake nakuru lake elementaita soysambu conservancy n encourages state party continue strengthen protection management property including relation following issues n upgrade protection lake elementaita strengthened legal protection recruitment site specific staff prohibition cattle grazing afforded similar standard protection components property n take effective action could reinforce link conservation three parts property including protecting secondary ecological areas opening wildlife corridors linking lakes nakuru elementaita soysambu conservancy n enhance catchment wide efforts curb deforestation especially mau escarpment within watershed lake nakuru n considering property s essential function within lakes wetlands region also encourages states parties kenya tanzania relevant states parties cooperate regarding effective conservation lake natron lakes region consider potential serial extensions part
