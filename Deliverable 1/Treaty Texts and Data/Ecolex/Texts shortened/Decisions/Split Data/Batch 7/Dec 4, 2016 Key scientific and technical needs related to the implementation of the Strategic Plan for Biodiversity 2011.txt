data access policy incentives reluctance share scientific data research remains significant cultural barrier biodiversity data access government regulation incentives stimulate open access culture by example requiring publication data acquired publicly funded research projects using open data licence enable reuse restrictions possible promote use common data standards biodiversity data truly accessible expressed using commonly accepted information standards enabling integration discovery data sets many different types biodiversity evidence including example specimens natural history collections field observations remote sensed data governments take lead insisting biodiversity data public monitoring research programmes use standards endorsed bodies biodiversity information standards www tdwg org invest digitization natural history collections natural history museums herbaria contain wealth information documenting biodiversity earliest days exploration natural world recent collection activities millions specimens already digitized accessible researchers via internet many collections remain undigitized partially accessible electronically investment digitization using public funds leveraging donations private sector charitable foundations yield returns reducing time needed researchers access data information dispersed institutions establish national biodiversity information facilities effective access biodiversity data information requires national coordination promote facilitate sharing data diverse stakeholders using appropriate standards best
