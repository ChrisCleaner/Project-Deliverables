stakeholders therefore another important means ensure appropriate policy responses implemented awareness raising education programmes fact practices generate perverse incentives rooted customary law social norms cultural traditions implies considerable obstacles exist removal obstacles beyond immediate reach formal policy making indirect approach awareness raising education may therefore particularly important means removing practices however awareness raising education programmes also important element successfully removing policies introducing mitigation policies overcome resistance powerful groups opposing removal transparency creating transparency regard intermediate final outcomes assessment study is regard objectives costs possible negative impacts policies practices contribute clarifying implicit choices priorities expose irresponsible policies practices wider public transparency therefore important element successful programme raise awareness issues consequence also increase political costs irresponsible policies generate political rewards appropriate action capacity building developing countries countries economies transition lack institutional administrative capacity often serious impediment removing mitigating perverse incentives policies generate perverse incentives can principle easily removed removal practices implementation successful mitigation policies may require substantial institutional administrative capacity capacity building supported relevant national regional international organizations therefore key precondition successfully removing mitigating policies practices generate perverse incentives conservation sustainable use biological diversity funding ensured capacity building international cooperation international cooperation important element removing mitigating perverse incentives set paragraph above ways means removal re instrumentation case legitimate valid policy objectives re instrumentation

decision vi annex d monitoring enforcement evaluation reforms stakeholder involvement even design implementation reforms relevant stakeholders involved evaluation ensure feedback unanticipated side effects failed mitigation measures shortcomings ensure shortcomings addressed timely fashion indicators information systems considered introduce appropriate information systems order facilitate

again transparency may crucial precondition ensuring effective stakeholder involvement evaluating reforms capacity building ultimate success chosen reform contingent upon successful monitoring
