recommendations july conference parties second meeting including recommendations new additional work undertaken secretariat makes draft guidance recommendations available november conference parties second meeting consideration recommendations annex ii decision mc outline structure content guidance management contaminated sites guidance management contaminated sites a introduction introduction provide general background information risks human health environment associated mercury exposure give information global use mercury particular relevance uses resulted likely result contaminated sites in particular artisanal gold mining use chlor alkali production industrial waste management sites may contaminated due run off sites introduction also provide overview obligations minamata convention mercury relation management contaminated sites highlight existing relevant national policies b site identification characterization section set mechanisms countries use identify sites contaminated mercury mercury compounds well techniques characterize contamination following identification suspected contaminated site guidance describe steps may required developing national list contaminated sites steps may include determination national level mercury mercury compound contamination would result site described contaminated term site may also need defined taking account areas affected run off primary site may affected guidance would cover mechanism national level determine potentially contaminated sites may include combination desk exercise gathering information current previous industrial mining activities mercury mercury compounds used released location waste dumping area well information gathered observation sites local reporting potentially contaminated sites identified mechanism characterized assessment protocol guidance would also cover protocol may encompass noting protocol would need agreed national level assessment protocol may include site inspection determine characteristics site including topography possibility run off contamination local water sources current usage site evidence previous uses detailed sampling air soil water site would needed characterize risks guidance would include information sampling information best characterize site well range analytical methodologies could used determine level mercury mercury compounds present sampling biota example fish waterfowl local mammals areas affected mercury contamination give useful information particularly risks local environment risk local populations exposures diet sampling local populations may also required description sampling techniques analytical methodologies would included guidance guidance may also include information prioritization activities initial screening activity used determine sites considered highest risk taking consideration factors unep mc cop dec location close population centres possibility contaminating ground water river systems actual levels mercury site c engaging public need engage public recognized essential guidance include information setting public consultation process including mechanisms collecting distributing information involvement public stakeholders establishing commitments plan relation assessment process possible remediation process methods collecting feedback assess public engagement levels satisfaction guidance also include information activities raise public awareness build capacity particularly relation requirements relation reducing exposure d human health environmental risk assessments impact site relies risk assessments human health environment hazards mercury well characterized universal exposure resulting presence mercury site specific guidance include information hazards mercury mercury compounds focus considerations site characteristics may associated exposure humans environment exposure assessed provide information determine risks associated site including determination risks primarily environment human health both e options managing risks posed contaminated sites following assessment contaminated site national decisions would need taken appropriate means managing site guidance provide information range options managing risks posed contaminated sites consider need protect humans environment throughout risk management process take account need actions conducted environmentally sound manner f evaluation benefits costs recognized identification characterization assessment remediation contaminated sites incur costs however also recognized impact mercury mercury compounds local populations environment also incurs costs guidance provide information assessing costs benefits activities address contaminated sites extent possible recognizing variation countries respect costs interventions g validation outcomes need validate outcomes delivered activity relation contaminated sites particular determine effectiveness interventions well consider need activities

contaminated sites section set possible strategies may taken parties wish cooperate activities relation contaminated sites strategies may include information sharing activities identification
