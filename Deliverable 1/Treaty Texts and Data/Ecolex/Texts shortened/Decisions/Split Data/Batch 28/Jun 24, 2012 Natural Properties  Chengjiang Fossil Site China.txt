present outstanding extraordinarily preserved record testifies rapid diversification life earth early cambrian period million years present geologically short interval almost major groups animals origins diverse geological evidence chengjiang fossil site presents fossil remains highest quality preservation conveys complete record early cambrian marine community one earliest records complex marine ecosystem unique window understanding structure early cambrian communities n criterion viii chengjiang fossil site presents exceptional record rapid diversification life earth early cambrian period million years present geologically short interval almost major groups animals origins property globally outstanding example major stage history life representing palaeobiological window great significance n exceptional palaeontological evidence chengjiang fossil site unrivalled rich species diversity date least phyla plus variety enigmatic groups species documented taxa recovered range algae sponges cnidarians numerous bilaterian phyla including earliest known chordates earliest known specimens several phyla cnidarians ctenophores priapulids vertebrates occur here many taxa represent stem groups extant phyla throw light characteristics distinguish major taxonomic groups n property displays excellent quality fossil preservation including soft hard tissues animals hard skeletons along wide array organisms entirely soft bodied therefore relatively unrepresented fossil record almost soft bodied species unknown elsewhere fine scale detailed preservation includes features alimentary systems animals example arthropod naraoia delicate gills enigmatic yunnanozoon sediments chengjiang provide currently oldest known fossil chordates phylum vertebrates belong n fossils rocks chengjiang fossil site together present complete record early cambrian marine community one earliest records complex marine ecosystem food webs capped sophisticated predators moreover demonstrates complex community structures developed early cambrian diversification animal life provides evidence wide range ecological niches property thus provides unique window understanding
