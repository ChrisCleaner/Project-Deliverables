monument cambrian explosion one pivotal points evolution life earth due platformal carbonate sedimentation occurred tropical belt without subsequent metamorphic tectonic transformation property preserves continuous fully documented richest record diversification skeletal animals calcified algae first appearances first mass extinction event documented parallel three types sedimentary basins first million years cambrian evolution n property comprises earliest temporally spatially largest fossil metazoan reef cambrian world reef site cambrian diversification comparable great barrier reef today high preservation quality skeletal soft bodied fossils coupled high resolution isotope palaeomagnetic records well various well preserved sedimentary fabrics allows researchers better understand
