rani ki vav preserved key architectural components and despite missing pavilion storeys original form design still easily recognized majority sculptures decorative panels remain in situ exceptional state conservation rani ki vav complete example stepwell tradition even though ceases function source water since river saraswati geo tectonic movement however silting flood caused historic event allowed exceptional preservation rani ki vav seven centuries n components including immediate surrounding soils adjoin vertical architecture stepwell included property terms intactness property seem experienced major losses since flooding silting century however patan like many indian urban centres experiencing rapid urban growth western expansion city towards rani ki vav carefully controlled protect integrity property future n authenticity n rani ki vav high level authenticity material substance design workmanship and certain extent atmosphere location setting maintained authentic material substance also required reconstructions structural stability instances reconstructed elements added structurally required protect remaining sculpture indicated smooth surfaces lack decoration easily distinguished historic elements around outer terrace ground level slopes smooth descent so called sacrificial terrace created prevent soil erosion following stronger rain falls unfortunately rani ki vav cannot retain authenticity use function result altered ground water levels following relocation saraswati river n protection management requirements n property protected national monument
