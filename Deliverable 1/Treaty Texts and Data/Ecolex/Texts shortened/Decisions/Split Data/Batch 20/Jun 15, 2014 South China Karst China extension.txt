aesthetic value area n property contains spectacular scientifically significant representative series karst landforms landscapes south china interior high plateau lowland plains constitutes world premier example humid tropical subtropical karst one planet great landscapes complements sites also present neighbouring countries including viet nam several world heritage properties also exhibit karst formations n criterion vii south china karst world heritage property includes spectacular karst features landscapes exceptional phenomena outstanding aesthetic quality includes stone forests shilin superlative natural phenomena include naigu stone forest occurring dolomitic limestone suyishan stone forest arising lake remarkable fengcong fenglin karsts libo wulong karst includes giant collapse depressions called tiankeng exceptionally high natural bridges them long stretches deep unroofed caves n also includes guilin displays spectacular tower karst internationally acclaimed fenglin riverine landscapes shibing karst best known example subtropical fengcong karst dolomite deep gorges spine like hills often draped cloud mist jinfoshan karst isolated island long detached yunnan guizhou plateau surrounded precipitous cliffs punctured ancient caves huanjiang karst provides natural extension libo karst contains outstanding fengcong features covered almost pristine monsoon forest n property forest cover natural vegetation mainly intact providing seasonal variation landscape enhancing property high aesthetic value intact forest cover also provides important habitat rare endangered species several components high biodiversity conservation value n criterion viii south china karst world heritage property reveals complex evolutionary history one world outstanding landscapes shilin libo global reference areas karst features landscapes exhibit stone forests shilin developed million years four major geological time periods permian present illustrating episodic nature evolution karst features libo contains carbonate outcrops different ages shaped millions years erosive processes impressive fengcong fenglin karsts libo also contains combination numerous tall karst peaks deep dolines sinking streams long river caves wulong represents high inland karst plateaus experienced considerable uplift giant dolines bridges wulong s landscapes contain
