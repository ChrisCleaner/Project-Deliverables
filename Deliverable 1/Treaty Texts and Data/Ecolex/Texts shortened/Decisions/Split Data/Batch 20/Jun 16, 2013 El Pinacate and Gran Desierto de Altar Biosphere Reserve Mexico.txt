adopts following statement outstanding universal value n brief synthesis n el pinacate gran desierto de altar biosphere reserve epgdabr located sonoran desert sonoran desert one four great north american deserts along chihuahuan desert great basin desert mojave desert epgdabr surface hectares hectares buffer zone large relatively undisturbed protected area comprises two distinct broad landscape types east dormant volcanic area around ha comprised pinacate shield extensive black red lava flows desert pavement volcanic shield boasts wide array volcanic phenomena geological formations including small shield type volcano visually striking feature concentration total enormous deep almost perfectly circular maar steam blast craters n west towards colorado river delta south towards gulf california gran altar desert north america s largest field active sand dunes active erg dunes dunes reach meters height contain variety dunes types dunes originate sediments nearby colorado delta local sources addition several arid granite massifs emerging like islands sandy desert flats ranging m a s l represent another remarkable landscape feature harbouring distinct plant wildlife communities n variety landscapes results extraordinary habitat diversity diversity life forms across many different taxa notable many species endemic sonoran desert locally restricted parts property feature sophisticated physiological behavioural adaptations extreme environmental conditions subtropical desert ecosystem reportedly hosts species vascular plants mammals birds reptiles well several amphibians even two endemic species freshwater fish n criterion vii property presents dramatic combination desert landforms comprising volcanic dune systems dominant features volcanic shield property boasts wide array volcanic phenomena geological formations including small shield type volcano visually striking feature concentration total enormous deep almost perfectly circular maar steam blast craters believed originate combination eruptions collapses property visually outstanding stark contrast dark coloured area comprised volcanic shield spectacular craters lava flows within immense sea dunes dunes reach meters height contain linear dunes star dunes dome dunes displaying enormous constantly changing contrasts terms form color addition predominant features several arid granite massifs emerging like islands sandy desert flats ranging high combination features results highly diverse visually stunning desert landscape n criterion viii property rsquo s desert volcanic landforms provide exceptional combination features great scientific interest vast sea sand dunes surrounds volcanic shield considered largest active dune system north america includes diverse range dunes nearly undisturbed include spectacular large star shaped dunes occur singly long ridges length volcanic exposures provide important complementary geological values desert environment assures dramatic display series impressive large craters cinder cones lava flows lava tubes taken together combination earth science features impressive laboratory geological geomorphological studies n criterion highly diverse mosaic habitats home complex communities surprisingly high species diversity across many taxonomic groups flora fauna species vascular plants mammals birds reptiles inhabit seemingly inhospitable desert insect diversity high despite fully documented several endemic species plants animals exist including two freshwater fish species one local endemic plant restricted small part volcanic shield within area large maternity caves migratory lesser long nosed bat important pollinator seed dispersal vector found within property noteworthy species include sonoran pronghorn endemic subspecies restricted south western arizona north western sonora threatened extinction n integrity n el pinacate gran desierto de altar biosphere reserve relatively undisturbed outstandingly high

management requirements n property counts effectively enforced adequate legal framework management well supported terms human financial resources management property guided long term management plan supported annual operational plans implementation supported local governments ngos indigenous peoples future revisions existing management plan consider ways means maintain enhance outstanding universal values conditions integrity property also propose new options mechanism ensure financial sustainability required effective long term management property addition management plan establish enhanced mechanisms effectively involve indigenous peoples planning management property n special attention given avoid indirect impacts nearby tourism development including increased traffic creates ecological disturbance littering wildlife road kills importantly tourism create pressure extend existing road infrastructure could facilitate entry points alien invasive species increasing impact off road vehicles observed requiring monitoring effective law enforcement epgdabr however critical long term management issue address potential problems derived tourism related water consumption n long term protection management property also includes need minimize and or mitigate impacts derived existing proposed roads ensure effective implementation measures avoid depletion scarce water resources maintain enhance ecological connectivity buffer climate change impacts effectively control eradicate alien invasive species transboundary cooperation maintain enhance management property essential therefore formal establishment transboundary protected area adjoining protected areas united states highly recommended n nbsp commends state party decision locate electricity transmission infrastructure along coast order conserve visual integrity area requests state party apply highest environmental standards alternative corridor northern part property n nbsp requests state party ensure full compliance environmental impact assessment requirements regards ongoing expansion route road development n nbsp encourages state party consider future expansion property include adjacent ramsar site bahia de adair n nbsp also encourages state parties mexico united states america strengthen cooperation conservation management shared greater sonoran desert ecosystem building upon existing agreements working relationships levels may eventually lead formal establishment transboundary protected area n nbsp encourages state parties mexico united states america cooperate saving sonoran pronghorn possible extinction n nbsp furthermore encourages state party neighbouring state party united states america fully consider environmental concerns security efforts along international border forms northern boundary property
