self sufficient families improved communications nearby towns means people look animals vegetable plots different ways previously result far fewer people over wintering troglodytic villages generation ago far fewer families using seasonal settlements around troglodytic dwellings inhabited winter inhabited weekends people return nearest town moved number reduced last years due decreasing numbers pastoralists property remain least still living used families sufficient cattle ensure survival two others abandoned seasonal buildings largely re constructed season therefore reflection traditional
