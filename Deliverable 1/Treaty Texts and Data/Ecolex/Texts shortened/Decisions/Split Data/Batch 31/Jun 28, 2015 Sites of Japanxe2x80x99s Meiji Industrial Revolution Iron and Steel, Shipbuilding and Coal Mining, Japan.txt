iv n adopts following statement outstanding universal value n brief synthesis n series industrial heritage sites focused mainly kyushu yamaguchi region south west japan represent first successful transfer industrialization west non western nation rapid industrialization japan achieved middle century early century founded iron steel shipbuilding coal mining particularly meet defence needs sites series reflect three phases rapid industrialisation achieved short space fifty years n first phase pre meiji bakumatsu isolation period end shogun era early period experimentation iron making shipbuilding prompted need improve defences nation particularly sea going defences response foreign threats industrialisation developed local clans second hand knowledge based mostly western textbooks copying western examples combined traditional craft skills ultimately unsuccessful nevertheless approach marked substantial move isolationism edo period part prompted meiji restoration n second phase accelerated new meiji era involved importation western technology expertise operate it third final phase late meiji period between full blown local industrialization achieved newly acquired japanese expertise active adaptation western technology best suit japanese needs social traditions japan terms western technology adapted local needs local materials organised local engineers supervisors n components sites within discrete areas six eight areas south west country one central part one northern part central island collectively sites outstanding reflection way japan moved clan based society major industrial society innovative approaches adapting western technology response local needs profoundly influenced wider development east asia n many sites later became fully fledged industrial complexes still operation part operational sites n criterion ii sites japan meiji industrial revolution illustrate process feudal japan sought technology transfer western europe america middle century technology adopted progressively adapted satisfy specific domestic needs social traditions thus enabling japan become world ranking industrial nation early century sites collectively represents exceptional interchange industrial ideas know how equipment resulted within short space time unprecedented emergence autonomous industrial development field heavy industry profound impact east asia n criterion iv technological ensemble key industrial sites iron steel shipbuilding coal mining testimony japan unique achievement world history first non western country successfully industrialize viewed asian cultural response western industrial values ensemble outstanding technological ensemble industrial sites reflected rapid distinctive industrialisation japan based local innovation adaptation western technology n integrity n component sites series adequately encompass necessary attributes outstanding universal value terms integrity individual sites though level intactness
