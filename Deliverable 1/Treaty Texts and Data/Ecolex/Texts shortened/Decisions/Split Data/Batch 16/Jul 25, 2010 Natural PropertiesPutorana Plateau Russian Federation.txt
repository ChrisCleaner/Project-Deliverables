harbours complete set subarctic arctic ecosystems isolated mountain range including pristine taiga forest tundra tundra arctic desert systems well untouched cold water lake river systems combination remoteness naturalness strict protection ensure ecological biological processes continue large scale minimal human influence property provides dramatic demonstration ecological processes including interactions healthy populations full range arctic fauna major reindeer migration crosses part property property also one centres plant species richness arctic n criterion vii vast diverse landscape striking natural beauty putorana plateau pristine affected human infrastructure superlative natural features include extensive area layered basalt traps dissected dozens deep canyons countless cold water rivers creeks thousands waterfalls lakes characterized fjord like formation associated large variation relief immense arctic boreal landscapes remain intact carpets lichens forest unusual northern latitudes n criterion ix property displays comprehensive set ecological biological processes associated diverse arctic subarctic ecosystems bio geographical location border tundra taiga biomes transition western eastern siberian floras makes property one centres plant species richness arctic combination landscape diversity remoteness naturalness degree protection extraordinary addition property may provide valuable evidence impacts climate change large scale natural arctic ecosystems proper monitoring research take place n integrity n property strictly protected state nature reserve zapovednik boundaries coincide putoransky state nature reserve established property large surrounded extensive buffer zone ha property s size remoteness naturalness well degree protection afforded essential attributes ensuring protection full range largely undisturbed landscapes processes basis outstanding universal value property includes key areas features essential maintaining property s natural beauty full range important natural features lakes canyons waterfalls located within boundaries property also sufficient size contains necessary elements maintain

combination strict legal management framework remote location lack road infrastructure enables effective management property relatively modest staffing funding levels protected area magnitude increasing tourism buffer zone carries risk unauthorized access property including hunting fishing need unambiguous rigorously enforced land use building arrangements buffer zone regulations tourism including strict limits air traffic n mining potential threat property federal law specially protected natural areas prohibits mining property must ensured impacts existing future mining outside property affect way outstanding universal value and or integrity property example air pollution pipelines development supporting infrastructure n one important inter regional reindeer migration routes crosses property continuation natural phenomenon depends strongly natural conditions areas within outside property effective legal management systems required ensure human use including tourism mining development adversely affect phenomenon n nbsp commends state party elaboration approval management plan property requests state party sustain commitment protection management monitoring property sufficient financial resources staffing levels ensure effective long term implementation management plan n nbsp also requests state party develop implement detailed management schemes sustainable recreational use environmentally friendly tourism within buffer zone property cooperation local authorities stakeholders including indigenous communities taking account needs tourism monitoring zoning regulatory frameworks licensing schemes buildings infrastructure tourism operations n nbsp encourages state party clearly demarcate boundaries property entry points strictly regulate air access property n nbsp also commends state party diverse range funding sources property requests state party ensure funding management also encourages state party increase investments research n nbsp recommends setting long term scientific research monitoring program document better understand impacts climate change diverse array ecosystems within property n nbsp notes important migration reindeer crosses property vulnerable impacts activities outside property tourism mining pipeline construction urges state party ensure threats important value property effectively controlled n nbsp finally requests state party ensure mining mineral exploitation inside property remain permanently prohibited also prevent indirect impacts mining outside boundaries could affect values property
