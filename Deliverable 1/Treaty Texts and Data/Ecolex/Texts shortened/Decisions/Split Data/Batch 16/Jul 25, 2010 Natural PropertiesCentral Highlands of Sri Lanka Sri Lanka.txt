central highlands sri lanka serial property comprising three component parts peak wilderness protected area horton plains national park knuckles conservation forest forests globally important provide habitat exceptional number endemic species flora fauna property includes largest least disturbed remaining areas submontane montane rain forests sri lanka global conservation priority many accounts include areas sri lankan montane rain forests considered super hotspot within western ghats sri lanka biodiversity hotspot half sri lanka s endemic vertebrates half country s endemic flowering plants endemic trees shrubs herbs restricted diverse montane rain forests adjoining grassland areas n criteria ix property includes largest least disturbed remaining areas submontane montane rain forests sri lanka global conservation priority many accounts component parts stretch across ceylonese rainforest ceylonese monsoon forest montane forests represented three serial properties faunal elements provide strong evidence geological biological processes evolution development taxa endemic purple faced langur sri lanka semnopithecus vetulus evolved several morphologically different forms recognizable today sri lankan leopard representative island genus panthera diverged felids million years ago unique sub species panthera pardus kotiya three nominated properties provide habitat subspecies leopard endemic sri lanka long isolation concomitant evolutionary processes also resulted sri lankan molluscan fauna distinct south asian region n criteria montane forests three serial components contain habitats many threatened plant animal species therefore prime importance in situ conservation property features exceptionally high numbers threatened species extraordinary levels endemism high levels species richness number taxonomic groups species vertebrates of indigenous fresh water fishes amphibians peak wilderness protected area endemic amphibians reptiles horton plains endemic amphibians reptiles knuckles conservation forest endemic n integrity n small size components nominated property result limited extent significant rain forest areas remaining sri lanka however provided property effectively protected managed areas sufficient especially since many plant animal species highly localized distributions boundary peak wilderness protected area includes range protected zones component common boundary horton plains national park effective arrangements protect properties impacts surrounding land use well address range threats required including via functioning buffer zones n protection management requirements n property strong effective legal protection combination state ownership range different protective legislation management three components nominated property delivered number different site specific management plans need kept continually reviewed updated made consistent other overall management system whole property required ensure consistency management monitoring presentation property addition provided individual management plans adequate sustained budgets required management property whole within component n nature magnitude existing potential threats three nominated properties varies components includes number issues case peak wilderness protected area major human use around two million pilgrims visit adam s peak annually contribute forest environmental degradation along pilgrim trails leading peak illicit gem mining also threat additional threats come spread invasive species forest die back occasional fires vandalism pressure cultivation cardamom effective action required ensure threats impact outstanding universal value property strong programme engagement communities live area surrounding

stakeholders n fully effective management monitoring framework tourism n recommends state party evaluate possibility serial extension existing sinharaja world heritage site considering nominated property complementary values existing property meets requirements one overall serial world heritage property specified operational guidelines committee considers single serial property would provide appropriate means recognizing outstanding universal value remaining high conservation value forests sri lanka two separate inscriptions nominated property sinharaja n commends state party significant
