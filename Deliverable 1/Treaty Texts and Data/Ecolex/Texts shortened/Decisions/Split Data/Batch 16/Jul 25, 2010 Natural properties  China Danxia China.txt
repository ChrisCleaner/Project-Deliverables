world heritage committee n examined documents whc com whc com inf n inscribes china danxia china world heritage list criteria vii viii n takes note following provisional statement outstanding universal value n brief synthesis n china danxia serial property comprising six areas found sub tropical zone southern china term china danxia describes physical landscape developed continental terrestrial reddish conglomerate sandstone also known red beds warm humid monsoon climate landscapes developed continental red terrigenous sedimentary beds influenced endogenous forces including uplift exogenous forces including weathering erosion process development characterized particular rock sequence tectonic background warm humid climatic conditions resulting erosion processes landforms n china danxia unrivaled rich warm humid climate red beds sandstone landform geomorphologic features characterized spectacular red cliffs range erosional landforms including dramatic natural pillars towers ravines valleys waterfalls china danxia also noted natural aesthetic landscape comprising red rocks green vegetation blue water white clouds n rugged landscapes nominated property helped conserve sub tropical broad leaved evergreen forests forests found within six serial sites range important micro habitats also found nature danxia landforms leads intensive fragmentation isolation ravine mountain top habitats natural habitats host many species flora fauna including endemic endangered threatened species conservation significance n criterion vii china danxia impressive unique landscape great natural beauty reddish conglomerate sandstone form landscape exceptional natural beauty shaped spectacular peaks pillars cliffs imposing gorges together exuberant forest winding rivers majestic waterfalls china danxia presents resplendent natural picture sharp contrast red rock green forests blue rivers striking feature china danxia renders great scenic appeal china danxia sites long appreciated general public well academic world celebrated artists one important scenic identities china even attained significance religious shrines significance elaborated countless paintings poems articles eulogizing unusual beautiful sites since ancient time n criterion viii compared similar areas china danxia outstanding example warm humid climate red beds landform world result favorable geological hydrological climatic conditions since least late mesozoic period china danxia areas preserve display much richer geomorphological ecological biological scenic features warm humid climate red beds landform place world component parts represent best examples least eroded most eroded danxia landforms displaying clear landform sequence young mature old age component site displaying characteristic geomorphologic features given stage china danxia contains wide variety well developed red beds landforms peaks towers mesas cuestas cliffs valleys caves arches shaped endogenous forces including uplift exogenous forces including weathering erosion china danxia provides range different aspects phenomenon physical landscape developed continental terrestrial reddish conglomerate sandstone warm humid monsoon climate illustrating range landforms relation forces processes formed them n integrity n nominated property china danxia satisfies requirements integrity protection management set operational guidelines implementation world heritage convention nominated property encompasses elements sufficient size necessarily reflect natural beauty earth science values danxia landform young stage mature stage old stage boundaries component parts associated buffer zones adequately defined maps well on site boundaries china danxia adequate relation nominated earth science aesthetic values buffer zone boundaries also clearly defined level management commitment appears adequate main challenges threats could face property n protection management requirements n component parts nominated property state owned national protected status including national park national nature reserve national forest park national geo park protected relative laws regulations national level regional level ensure adequate long term legislative regulatory institutional traditional protection outstanding universal values basis laws regulations protection activities well practiced nominated sites n efficient management systems different levels built enough qualified staff china danxia areas planning serial property advanced integrated management plan prepared property whole well individual plans six areas series plans identify clear rationale management mechanisms protection property research adaptive management techniques including baseline condition assessment monitoring change natural values species established local communities aware world heritage nomination stakeholders also supportive world heritage proposal ensures long term management n commends state party efforts towards protection management property across different provinces china n requests state party ensure effective long term management protection future view make property components meet integrity requirements natural world heritage properties supported adequate effective buffer zones protection wider catchment areas n invites state party support organization international meetings continue scientific research regarding danxia landform n nbsp also requests state party continue focus protection effective management important biodiversity values n nbsp requests state
