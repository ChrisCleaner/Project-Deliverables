area also led net adverse results results include increased levels dissolved nitrogen phosphate sedimentation turbidity decreased water column lake volume increased primary productivity significant changes structure phytoplankton populations acceleration eutrophication transition srebarna lake marsh decline biodiversity particularly fish species diminished use area rare threatened resident migratory bird species reduced nesting success ratios key breeding bird species world heritage significance also noted sixteenth session committee included srebarna nature reserve list world heritage danger srebarna placed montreux record register sites need priority conservation action implementation ramsar convention n committee examined state conservation report state party indicated canal linking danube srebarna first time since successfully established bilateral assistance us agency international development usaid operational control structures permanent reserve administration established intensive monitoring studies ongoing committee examined monitoring report prepared ramsar secretariat indicating new canal water control structure operational allowing water srebarna lake also indicated dalmatian pelican nesting colony re established levels higher found time srebarna s inscription world heritage list allocation ramsar small grants fund enabled initiation preparation management plan srebarna n committee pleased learn team undertook mission october able observe continuing improvements state conservation srebarna team concluded significant affirmative actions investments made bulgarian authorities investigate analyse mitigate threats srebarna s world heritage values particular mission team noted following positive results n a re establishment operational seasonal connection danube srebarna lake surrounding wetlands resulted increase water volume water column dilution and or reduction dissolved nitrogen phosphate levels lowered turbidity phytoplankton populations re established structure stabilised fish species diversity increased pre inscription levels n b breeding success ratio nesting colony dalmatian pelicans significantly exceeded average population levels breeding pairs produced successfully fledged chicks registering marked improvement success ratios recorded period since srebarna s recognition world heritage sixty breeding pairs pygmy cormorant also reflect similar significant key species response favourable ecological conditions present globally significant rare water bird species including corncrake ferruginous duck also responded positive manner n c administratively significant legislation draft protected areas act no promulgated ministry environment waters moew approved council ministers second review national assembly intent legislation strengthen conservation bulgaria general harmonize bulgarian protected area classification international standards including relevant european union directives elements draft legislation particular relevance continuing recognition srebarna strict nature reserve activities scientific research excluded n d small competent staff established srebarna nature reserve management currently cooperating well academy science ongoing monitoring activities automated weather recording facility place facilitate monitoring activities management staff academy researchers appear excellent terms local community leadership would necessary establish effective co operation management buffer zone although necessary integrated management planning process initiated final draft plan may still months away appear adequately involve public participation address ethno historical socio economic considerations plan outline may necessarily translate action plan current form n light significant improvements state conservation srebarna committee n commended state party efforts undertaken restore srebarna s environment world heritage values standards n encouraged state party accelerate interdisciplinary management planning threat mitigation efforts continue pursue intensive monitoring assure continued ecological restoration area may removed list world heritage danger demonstrated recovery appears sustainable n encouraged state party seek necessary cooperation romania assure feeding areas flyways srebarna breeding dalmatian pelican population offered safe haven based terms world heritage convention article establish favourable hydraulic regime danube river n encouraged state party actively participate regional international scientific management exchanges benefit management danube river wetland resources n encouraged state party explore ways means collaborate states parties sharing resident migratory bird species populations collectively consider composite transboundary danube wetland world heritage site link embrace suitable qualified areas collectively represent globally significant outstanding natural cultural resource n committee consider removing srebarna list world heritage danger upon passage pending draft protected areas act no substantively similar conservation legislation satisfactory timely completion srebarna management plan together establishment effective resource buffer zone management regimes compatible restoring maintaining world heritage values provision data support indices sustained world heritage value recovery year effect committee suggested state party n involve local community ngo representation management planning process formulation specific co operative actions may required management buffer zone adjacent lake srebarna drainage area n ii consider acquiring additional scientific data information including ethno historical palaeobotanical analysis lake sediments prior dredging activity complete aerial photographic records management planning n iii develop srebarna action plan establishing management environmental education interpretation priorities requirements supplement srebarna management
