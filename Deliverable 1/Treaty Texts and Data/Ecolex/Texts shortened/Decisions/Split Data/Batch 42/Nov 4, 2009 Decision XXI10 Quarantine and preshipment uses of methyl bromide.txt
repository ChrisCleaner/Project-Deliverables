regulatory requirements allowing alternative options adopting pays taxes methyl bromide imports and or limiting quarantine pre shipment consumption noting methyl bromide use emissions also reduced technical improvements fumigation practices using gas tight structures determining minimum effective methyl bromide doses monitoring fumigation minimise re dosing using recovery equipment treating
