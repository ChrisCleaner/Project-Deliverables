indigenous peoples local communities management wise use wetlands acknowledging vital role wetland ecosystems especially healthy well managed wetlands reducing disaster risk acting natural buffers protective barriers instance mitigating land erosion impact dust sand storms floods tidal surges tsunamis landslides storing large volumes water thereby reducing peak flood flow wet season maximizing water storage dry season recognizing fully functioning wetland ecosystems enhance local resilience disasters providing fresh water important products sustaining lives livelihoods local populations biodiversity aware un millennium ecosystem assessment recognized significant services ecosystems including wetlands provide human communities regulating frequency magnitude hazard events floods fires droughts providing natural barriers mitigate adverse impacts hazards protect communities also recognized continuing accelerated loss vital ecosystem functions services wetlands aware global assessment report disaster risk reduction declaration future want similar un global coordinating bodies call addressing disaster risk reduction context sustainable development increased coordination national regional international levels enable robust response environmental emergencies improved forecasting early warning systems considering sendai framework disaster risk reduction acknowledges declining ecosystems underlying disaster risk driver recognizes importance strengthened sustainable use management ecosystems implementation integrated environmental natural resource management approaches incorporate disaster risk reduction concerned devastating impacts disasters delivery ecosystem services thus maintenance ecological character wetlands international importance ramsar sites wetlands affected countries serious effects lives livelihoods millions people biodiversity caused major environmental social economic impacts aware disaster risk reduction requires reduction exposure vulnerabilities enhancing capacity people prepare for withstand cope recover disasters sustainable management use land water resources reduce buffer certain circumstances mitigate disaster risk recognizing wetlands parts world play important role disaster risk reduction wetlands effectively managed restored necessary conference contracting parties affirms need develop implement management plans wetlands adapt instruments designed management existing natural resources especially ramsar sites integrate principles ecosystem based management adaptation natural hazards dust sand storms floods droughts fires landslides coastal erosion tsunamis hurricanes storms storm surges also accelerated sea level rise strongly encourages mainstreaming disaster risk reduction measures management

parties incorporate financial resource requirements appropriate wetland conservation restoration management activities related disaster risk reduction long term investment programming ensuring inclusion measures prevent adverse environmental social impacts invites contracting parties partners ensure implementation wetland ecosystem based management restoration projects programmes conducted appropriately ensure ecological integrity original functioning specific ecosystems recalling cbd decision xii ecosystem conservation restoration emphasizes critical importance coastal wetlands ecosystem services including disaster risk reduction biodiversity conservation welcomes initiatives support conservation restoration coastal wetlands including options build coasts initiative part global movement restore coastal wetlands encourages contracting parties consider engaging development implementation proposed initiative recognizing references disaster risk reduction contained proposals open working group sustainable development goals sendai framework disaster risk reduction encourages contracting parties ramsar secretariat emphasize importance conserving restoring wise use wetlands disaster risk reduction discussions encourages contracting parties understand predicament of recognize roles challenges indigenous peoples local communities and applicable experience knowledge ancestral rights methods approaches wetland management disaster risk reduction making possible participation effective use different strategies councils meetings plans programmes disposal national governments also urges contracting parties adopt approaches disaster risk reduction ensure rights wetland dependent displaced persons requests scientific technical review panel strp consider reviewing compiling existing guidance wetland ecosystem based adaptation concerning disaster risk reduction development programme work line strategic plan order present set practical policies guidance
