taxonomic needs already identified annex additional planned activities i planned activity mountain biological diversity rationale taxonomic composition mountain biodiversity varies biogeographic region latitude altitude mountain well relief cases mountains provide necessary seasonal resource organisms times found lowland biomes furthermore groups organisms representatives lowland well montane region vast range groups organisms encountered rather taxonomic groups consequently montane regions often hot spots biodiversity renders full taxonomic treatment challenge requires many actors experts different organisms mountain ranges extend considerable length area regional approach mountain biodiversity paramount importance relevant information available many different databases inventories therefore global taxonomy initiative contribute mountain biodiversity programme work several ways including collating relevant information expertise unep cbd cop dec viii page ii outputs increased
