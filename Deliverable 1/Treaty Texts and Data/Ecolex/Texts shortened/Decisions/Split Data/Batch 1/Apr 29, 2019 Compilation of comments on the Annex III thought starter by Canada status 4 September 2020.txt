union member states united states america basel action network hazardous waste europe colombia bogot colombia july ref comments review annexes iii basel convention dear ms kohler first would like thank expert working group review annexes work support provided co chairs secretariat pleased submit views regard to canada s thought starter review annex iii general issues detailed proposals regarding review annexes iii whether additional constituents characteristics relation plastic waste added annex iii views therefore preliminary specific comments without prejudice future proposals could submitted colombia comments canada s thought starter review annex iii colombia appreciates proposal prepared canada presents following comments ghs vs un model regulations transport dangerous goods colombia considers proposed approach appropriate includes characteristics physical hazards also related health environmental hazards considered relevant objectives convention based ghs criteria precedence hazardous characteristics measure protection workers environment colombia considers appropriate include annex indications regarding precedence hazard characteristics effects packaging requirements given hazardous wastes may one relevant hazard characteristic would agree include rules precedence based guidelines united nations model regulations transport dangerous goods acute toxicity colombia would agree incorporate classification criteria hazard characteristic acute toxicity ghs categories single hazard class current therefore inclusion new hazard class considered necessary new hazard characteristics colombia agrees inclusion new hazard characteristics annex iii particularly referring health environmental hazards also consider necessary distinguish hazard categories a b main categories provide sufficient information corresponding hazard classes de minimis concentration values colombia finds complex assign absolute concentration limit values determine health environmental hazard characteristics waste due great heterogeneity waste fact usually hazardous waste mixture different compounds pure substance therefore considered appropriate estimate hazards taking account contribution hazardous components waste use concentration limits suggested ghs would classified hazardous specific comments proposal proposed definitions physical hazard classes based united nations model regulations transport dangerous goods given alignment ghs desired incorporates classification criteria transport regulations consider physical hazard classes corresponding definitions classification criteria accordance ghs included annex consider ghs categories fall acute toxicity class sense proposed new class would considered agree inclusion health environmental hazard classes based ghs relation proposed new classes refer types chemical compounds hazard characteristics additionally would already covered several already established hazard categories therefore consider convenient inclusion new categories tests classification principles regarding testing classification principles colombia considers important include references recommended test methods characterize hazards included annex recommended test methods standardized much possible recognized organizations e g united nations oecd astm iso iec also suggest future development guidance hazard characteristics them comments general issues detailed proposals regarding review annex iii unep chw raewg colombia appreciates proposal presented ue sm makes following comments proposal considered complete proposed amendments enrich annex sense extend scope characteristics health environmental hazards relevant objectives convention complement organize information facilitate correct interpretation likewise colombia agrees with ghs classification criteria included guidelines identification hazardous characteristics including methods assessing characteristics hazardous waste pure substance mixture use ghs concentration limit values purpose latter make easier generator identify hazardous characteristics waste inclusion proposed new hazard classes introductory text annex although see need make specific reference substances exceed low pop contents given text already makes reference general technical guidelines environmentally sound management wastes consisting of containing contaminated persistent organic pollutants developed basel convention grouping several ghs hazard classes single characteristic flammables oxidants among others reorganization codification amended annex facilitate reading interpretation contents additionally recommend inclusion substances mixtures corrosive metals class characteristic corrosive also consider appropriate include note effect desensitized explosives could included scope finally concerning proposals submitted canada european union member states colombia would support proposal european union member states amend annex iii considered appropriate terms identification hazardous characteristics waste comments general issues detailed proposals regarding review annex unep chw raewg general issues consider coherent appropriate proposal made ue sm regarding structure annex delete order listing entries according four categories regarding level specification individual entries support keep annex categories general status quo exceptions for example mercury mercury compounds reflect minamata classification also agree add new y entries order extend scope annex i ensuring wastes listed corresponding entry annex viii support possibility add catch all entries detailed proposals support changes proposed eu entries would like propose additional modification entries shown follows track changes halogenated organic solvents e g carbon tetrachloride trichloroethane methyl chloroform organohalogen compounds e g brominated chlorinated flame retardants brominated chlorinated fluorinated refrigerants propellants fire protection foaming process agents chemicals referred this annex e g support new entries proposed eu doubts concerns following four new entries would like receive information rationale behind proposals aluminum metallic dispersible form metal powder aluminum compounds silver compounds fibers asbestos capable causing lung damage inhalation pharmaceutical including phytopharmaceutical veterinary compounds e g cytotoxic cytostatic drugs case would important clarify phytopharmaceutical products considered hazardous waste modification could possibly cause confusion entry could helpful add examples subcategory order illustrate type hazardous waste would covered aforementioned new entries comments whether additional constituents characteristics relation plastic waste added annex iii see need include new entry annex plastic waste since hazardous substances found type waste e g hexavalent chromium cadmium mercury lead pbde already included categories annex finally hope find comments useful look forward participating subsequent work discussions review annexes sincerely andrea lpez arias member expert working group review annexes ministry environment sustainable development
