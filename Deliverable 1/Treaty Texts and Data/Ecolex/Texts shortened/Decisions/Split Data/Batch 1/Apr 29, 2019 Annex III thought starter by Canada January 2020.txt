process paper intended provide general technical concepts review annex iii guide ewg identification hazard characteristics classification rules relevant convention achieve objectives paper consists two sections detailed rationale chosen topics interest first provided support revised version annex iii contained second section ii detailed rationale chosen topics interest ghs vs un model regulations transport dangerous goods basel convention currently relies heavily un model regulations transport dangerous goods determination hazard characteristics model regulations provide guidance proper packaging requirements precedence hazardous characteristics tools classification hazardous waste including tests un model regulations transport dangerous goods meant protect human health environment transport hazardous goods directly relevant convention transboundary movement hazardous waste especially physical hazards national regulations international agreements movement hazardous goods example adr often structured manner similar un model regulations transport dangerous goods however health environmental hazards derive disposal hazardous wastes covered model regulations reason basel convention may consider adopting novel approach add hazard characteristics covered model regulations convention could find inspiration ghs adapt definitions support objective environmentally sound management hazardous wastes revised annex iii section two document attempts find balance characteristics designed mostly protection workers environment transport hazardous substances un model

objectives convention also presented precedence hazardous characteristics selection primary hazardous characteristic waste meets criteria inclusion one affects packaging requirements ensure appropriate level protection workers environment transport primary hazardous characteristic should general one stringent requirements achieve greater legal clarity better protection environment human health basel convention may want consider adding classification rules basis guidance un model regulations transport dangerous goods acute toxicity acute toxicity un model regulations transport dangerous goods meant cover hazardous substances transport substance value mg kg bodyweight oral deemed acute toxic since substances pose major threat transport therefore waste containing substances category acute toxicity could understood currently covered convention these categories correspond class un model regulations transport dangerous goods basel convention may want consider clarifying wastes containing substances categories acute toxicity according ghs included scope would allow protection workers transport also better protection environment ensuring obligations esm pic apply wastes containing acute toxic substances categories suggest addition new hazard characteristic categories refer ensure alignment un model regulations and packaging requirements kept categories new hazard characteristics notable exception new hazard characteristics health environmental hazards whose definitions classification principles based ghs including ghs sub categories category point would

specific health environmental hazards ghs un model regulations transport dangerous goods substances lead serious adverse effects human health environment adding scope convention annex iii opposed listing substances individually annex proposed members ewg would allow convention adjust easily new knowledge hazardous substances would necessary amend annex control waste containing substances newly identified persistent organic pollutants endocrine disruptors long substances found least one waste stream considered least one constituents annex for example hazard codes could deleted basel convention feels new hazard codes cover whole spectrum ecotoxic toxic delayed chronic substances could also kept catch all substances de minimis concentration values knowledge substances especially
