wastes wastes minimum reducing minimum controlling transboundary movements wastes consistent environmentally sound efficient management among general obligations parties basel convention emphasizes need adopt life cycle approach plastics increase resource efficiency importance waste management hierarchy also emphasizes relevance cartagena declaration prevention minimization recovery hazardous wastes wastes importance activities identified road map action implementation addressing plastic waste including challenges related marine plastic litter welcomes many national regional international initiatives countries organizations industry regional centres civil society taken response challenge marine plastic litter microplastics including regulatory action financial incentives extended producer responsibility public awareness voluntary action calls upon parties others make efforts domestic level prevent minimize generation plastic waste including increasing durability reusability recyclability plastic products furthering repair refurbishment remanufacturing plastic products technically economically feasible promote environmentally sound efficient management plastic waste example single use plastic fishing gear improving collection transport treatment recycling plastic waste improving creating markets recycled materials made plastic waste improving means recovery reducing transboundary movement plastic waste minimum consistent environmentally sound efficient management reducing discharge plastic waste microplastics ensure transboundary movements plastic waste undertaken accordance provisions convention well related national laws relevant regional agreements encourages parties others set time bound targets adopt adequate measures ensure plastic packaging designed reusable recyclable cost effective manner plastic packaging recycling rate weight monitored significantly improved global regional national levels recycled content plastic products significantly increased taking account ministerial declaration adopted fourth session united nations environment assembly significantly reduce single use plastic products notably specific measures development affordable environmentally friendly alternatives use substitutes products alternatives economically available reduction consumption setting specific collection targets obligations producers cover costs waste management appropriate clean up awareness raising measures including extended producer responsibility schemes measures inform consumers reuse waste management options impacts littering take measures foster innovation relation plastic waste taking account life cycle approach view better addressing marine plastic litter microplastics iii reducing risk hazardous constituents plastic waste notes plastic waste may contain potentially hazardous substances may contaminated hazardous substances mixed hazardous wastes and such may pose risk human health environment including marine terrestrial ecosystems strongly encourages parties taking account capabilities others especially private sector make efforts create new technologies processes improve existing technologies remove reduce use hazardous constituents production plastics subsequent stage life cycle order facilitate plastic waste management including recycling process provide financial technological support welcomes work stockholm convention persistent organic pollutants eliminate control production use persistent organic pollutants plastic products may reduce presence pollutants plastics waste thus contributing reducing risks associated marine plastic litter microplastics global level iv review annexes iii requests expert working group review annexes i iii iv related aspects
