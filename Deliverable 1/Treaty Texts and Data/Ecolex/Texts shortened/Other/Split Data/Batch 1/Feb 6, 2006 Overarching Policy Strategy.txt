strategic approach recognition growing gaps capacities different countries manage chemicals safely need improve synergies existing instruments processes growing sense urgency regarding need assess manage chemicals effectively achieve goal articulated paragraph johannesburg plan implementation also need countries effective governance structures help make strategic approach lasting success since united nations conference environment development rio de janeiro rio declaration agenda adopted much done improve chemicals management regulatory systems introduced strengthened much information made available chemicals many chemicals assessed national level internationally wide range risk management measures introduced new tools globally harmonized system classification labelling chemicals pollutant release transfer registers taken developed new international instruments programmes created industry developed extended programmes contribute better chemicals management many countries active well informed public interest movements promoting awareness good practices regard chemicals is however recognized that existing international policy framework chemicals completely adequate needs strengthened implementation established international policies uneven coherence synergies existing institutions processes completely developed improved often limited information many chemicals currently use often limited access information already exists many countries lack capacity manage chemicals soundly national subregional regional global levels inadequate resources available address chemical safety issues many countries particularly bridge widening gap developed countries one hand developing countries countries economies transition other risk reduction including preventing reducing remediating minimizing eliminating risks key need pursuing sound management chemicals throughout entire life cycle including appropriate products articles containing chemicals recognized that risk assessment management strategies supported improved scientific understanding role behaviour substances addressing product life cycles central achieving risk reduction risk reduction measures appropriately informed scientific methods consideration social economic factors needed reduce eliminate harmful effects chemicals inappropriate uses risk reduction measures need improved prevent adverse effects chemicals health children pregnant women fertile populations elderly poor workers vulnerable groups susceptible environments development safer alternatives including alternatives chemicals concern affordable sustainable technologies accelerated developing countries countries economies transition need better access affordable safer technologies alternatives also assist reducing
