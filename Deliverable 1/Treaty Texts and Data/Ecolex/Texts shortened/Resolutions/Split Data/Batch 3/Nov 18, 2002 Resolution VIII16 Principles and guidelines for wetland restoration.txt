conservation wise use although operational objective strategic plan refers restoration rehabilitation difference two terms clear ramsar convention attempted provide precise definitions terms might said restoration implies return pre disturbance conditions rehabilitation implies improvement wetland functions without necessarily returning pre disturbance conditions words often used
