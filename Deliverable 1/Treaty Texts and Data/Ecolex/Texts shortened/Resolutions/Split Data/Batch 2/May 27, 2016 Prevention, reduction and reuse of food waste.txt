united nations environment assembly concerned roughly one third food produced globally human consumption wasted lost including vast quantity scarce resources land energy water used produce food later lost wasted recognizing also negative environmental social economic impact food lost wasted including vast quantities scarce resources land energy water used produce transport food later lost wasted food waste enters often over burdened waste management systems recognizing international community fundamental priority achieving food security nutrition ending hunger caused inter alia adverse environmental effects climate change desertification recognizing developing countries food waste losses occur mainly exclusively early stages food value chain recognizing waste management hierarchy addresses organic inorganic components solid waste prioritises rank order prevention minimization reuse recycling recovery including energy recovery final disposal recognizing effective management food waste would prioritize source reduction reduce volume prevention minimisation food lost wasted reuse safe nutritious food suitable human consumption otherwise might wasted recovery lost wasted food residues animal feed safe so diversion food loss waste landfill disposal beneficial use industry including energy recovery recognizing role market based incentives may play reducing food loss waste taking account differing national circumstances noting particular roles opportunities relevant governmental institutions including environment ministries national institutions environmental responsibilities well international organizations also noting responsibility agricultural ministries well relevant ministries food security partners contribute solving food loss waste problems particular orientation towards addressing socioeconomic environmental public health problems promoting sustainable development oriented solutions opportunities recognizing appreciation work united

sustainable food systems programme year framework programmes sustainable consumption production developed strategic partnership united nations environment programme food agricultural organization united nations welcoming agenda sustainable development includes inter alia sustainable development goal target halve per capita global food waste retail consumer levels reduce food losses along production supply chains including post harvest losses recognizing positive impact target achievement sustainable development goals particularly goal invites governments taking account differing national circumstances implement programmes including appropriate market based incentives reduce amount food lost wasted stages food value chain promote reuse edible food might otherwise wasted order increase amount nutritious healthy food available human consumption especially food nutritionally insecure populations reduce amount usable food disposed waste work cooperatively international organizations institutions private sector non governmental organizations interested stakeholders develop programmes prevent reduce food loss waste along whole food value chain promote environmentally sound management food loss waste including inedible parts food uses animal feed safe so subject prevailing health regulations industrial applications composting energy production respecting waste management hierarchy participate existing international efforts regarding improved methodologies better measure food loss waste generation socioeconomic environmental benefits achieve efficient sustainable food systems engage international cooperation objective reducing and or eradicating food loss resulting contamination production stage sharing technical knowledge good practices proven
