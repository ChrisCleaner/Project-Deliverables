increasing problem due large still increasing use combined inadequate management disposal plastic waste plastic debris marine environment steadily fragmenting secondary microplastics also recognizes need knowledge research source fate microplastics impact biodiversity marine ecosystems human health noting recent knowledge particles ingested biota could transferred higher levels marine food chain causing adverse effects notes microplastics may also contribute transfer marine ecosystems persistent organic pollutants persistent bioaccumulative toxic substances contaminants adhere particles recognizes microplastics marine environment originate wide range sources including breakdown plastic debris oceans industrial emissions sewage run off use products containing microplastics emphasizes
