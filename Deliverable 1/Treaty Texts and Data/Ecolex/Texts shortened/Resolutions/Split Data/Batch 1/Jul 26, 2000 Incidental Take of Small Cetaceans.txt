best way acquiring reliable information by catch extrapolation existing information comparable gear types areas may necessary observer scheme logistically impossible noting international whaling commission endorsed scientific committee s advice estimated annual by catch estimated population size indicates research undertaken immediately clarify status stocks estimated annual by catch may cause population decline requires immediate action reduce by catch noting resolution incidental take small cetaceans adopted meeting parties ascobans doc recalling second meeting parties agreed specific conservation objectives needed defined enhance work ascobans monitor success also agreed approach achieve working definitions given ascobans mop doc specifically aim ascobans interpreted to restore and or maintain biological management stocks small cetaceans level would reach lowest possible anthropogenic influence suitable short term practical sub objective restore and or maintain stocks populations carrying capacity general aim minimise i e ultimately reduce zero anthropogenic removals within yet specified time frame intermediate target levels set longer term approach involves inter alia taking account uncertainty available data developed advisory committee recognising high selectivity bottom set gillnets relation target fish species noting iwc ascobans working group harbour porpoises advised maximum annual by catch achieves ascobans interim objective infinite time horizon assuming uncertainty parameter population size year advice subsequently endorsed iwc meeting
