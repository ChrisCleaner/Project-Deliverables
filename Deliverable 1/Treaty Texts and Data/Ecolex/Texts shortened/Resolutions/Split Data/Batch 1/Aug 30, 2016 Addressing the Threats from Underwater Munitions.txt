migratory species also recalling united nations general assembly resolution cooperative measures assess increase awareness environmental effects related waste originating chemical munitions dumped sea recalling sustainable development goals sdgs agenda sustainable development adopted september especially goal conserve sustainably use oceans seas marine resources includes following targets prevent significantly reduce marine pollution kinds particular land based activities including marine debris nutrient pollution sustainably manage protect marine coastal ecosystems avoid significant adverse impacts including strengthening resilience take action restoration order achieve healthy productive oceans increase scientific knowledge develop research capacity transfer marine technology taking account intergovernmental oceanographic commission criteria guidelines transfer marine technology order improve ocean health enhance contribution marine biodiversity development developing countries
