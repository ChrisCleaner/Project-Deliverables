implications ramsar convention wetlands relation restoring peatlands also outside arctic sub arctic arctic sub arctic wetland biodiversity ecosystem services vulnerability noting various wetlands types characterized either seasonally permanently frozen occur arctic sub arctic including permafrost peatlands wet tundra coastal shallow marine areas well glacial forelands areas contain unique biodiversity thus global importance aware diversity value wetland ecosystems arctic sub arctic importance migratory species marine mammals ungulates birds several different migration patterns flyways conscious arctic sub arctic wetlands global significance biodiversity ecosystem services especially indigenous peoples local communities also services roles sinks stores carbon noting arctic sub arctic wetland ecosystems sensitive vulnerable example changes hydrology water levels oil spills particulary long lived difficult address dark midwinters extremely low temperatures disturbance fragile

relation role functions arctic wetlands supporting sustainable development biodiversity resilience arctic conference contracting parties knowledge awareness encourages concerned contracting parties obtain sufficient data arctic sub arctic wetlands order take necessary measures conservation sustainable use recognizing constraints working arctic undertaking necessary inventories of research on arctic sub arctic wetlands appropriate encourages concerned contracting parties undertake assessments appropriate subject availability resources state arctic sub arctic wetlands include hotspot

biogeographical regions arctic sub arctic identifying wetland sites high conservation value may merit additional conservation measures designate new ramsar sites within territories comprise under represented wetland types and or important links flyways migratory routes wise use mitigation impact wetlands restoration encourages concerned contracting parties appropriate seek ensure restoration measures wetlands arctic sub arctic prioritized undertaken order improve connectivity habitats especially sites importance migrating wetland species sites available fresh water subregions fresh water supply is may become locally scarce continuing climate change encourages concerned contracting parties appropriate seek ensure analysis impacts development projects transportation tourism activities undertaken means support contracting parties efforts maintain ecological character wetlands taking account ramsar resolution xi integrated framework avoiding mitigating compensating wetland losses encourages concerned contracting parties appropriate herds domestic semi domestic grazing animals arctic sub arctic areas work stakeholders ensure population size herds kept level affect wetland populations wild grazing animals combined grazing pressure domestic wild animals risk overgrazing wetlands encourages concerned contracting parties address restoration adaptation measures feasible appropriate issues large scale erosion resulting unsustainable land uses arctic sub arctic roads off road driving extraction natural resources encourages concerned contracting parties appropriate seek
