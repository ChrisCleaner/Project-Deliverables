meeting conference contracting parties ramsar convention wetlands wetlands sustainable urban future dubai united arab emirates october resolution xiii sustainable wetlands concerned wetlands lost many areas world since wetlands data available lost since rate loss three times greater forests global wetlands outlook noting recognition one main drivers loss degradation wetlands indicated millennium ecosystem assessment clearing drainage land including agricultural production concerned many wetland areas centuries used sustainable agricultural production lost past years either intentionally drainage increased sharply since indirectly groundwater depletion aware that resolution viii agriculture wetlands water resource management conference contracting parties recognizes wetlands play important roles relation agriculture noting high dependence local communities wetland resources particularly developing countries notably terms small scale subsistence agriculture domestic water supply uses may contribute directly poverty alleviation aware resolution x enhancing biodiversity rice paddies wetland systems resolution xi agriculture wetland interactions rice paddy pest control

protect restore water related ecosystems adopted united nations environment assembly third session recalling resolution xii ramsar convention s programme communication capacity building education participation awareness cepa identifies key actors including agriculture sector specifies main messages target audience acknowledging assessment report intergovernmental science policy platform biodiversity ecosystem services pollinators pollination food production shows number features current intensive agricultural practices threaten pollinators pollination moving towards sustainable agriculture promoting diversity agricultural landscapes offers key strategic responses risks associated pollinator decline also acknowledging birdlife international report state world s birds taking pulse planet reports agriculture key driver decline number bird species impacting globally threatened bird species including waterfowl aquatic birds realizing wetlands often intricately connected groundwater either wetland replenishing groundwater groundwater feeding wetland combination two depending time space human climatic impact one system affect other also realizing increasing lack water landscapes scarcity natural vegetation cover contributed increases frequency amplitude temperature fluctuations that many parts world maximum summer temperatures becoming high water shortages severe either humans livestock live comfortably optimum crop yields realizing severe shortages also surpluses water occur frequently today many parts world past increasing frequency persistent droughts highlighted resolution viii impact natural disasters particularly drought wetland ecosystems extreme weather events thunderstorms hailstorms sandstorms also late frosts leads major losses agricultural production thus threatens food security efforts eradicate poverty concerned non sustainable agricultural practices adverse impact landscape species diversity including wetland biodiversity cause soil erosion leaching nutrients loss soil fertility agriculture also adverse impact wetland functions services ramsar resolution xiii recalling resolution x climate change wetlands states climate change accelerated desertification major impacts water availability distribution affecting wetland functions values well agricultural production also recalling high primary secondary production wetlands important role retaining nutrients water well contribution mitigation climate change concerned continuing drainage wetlands especially peatlands agricultural production forestry natural resource exploitation accelerates climate change resolution xii peatlands climate change wise use implications ramsar convention aware wetlands may provide resources used human animal nutrition building materials energy production acknowledging many examples across world show agriculture forestry conducted successfully conserving wetlands many wetlands worldwide remain important sources fisheries crop production animal husbandry conference contracting parties encourages contracting parties develop sustainable agricultural practices promote conservation wetlands discouraging wetland drainage properly managing aquifers enhancing water retention time landscape recreating local atmospheric water cycles contributing climate change mitigation alleviation adverse impacts droughts well reducing peak water discharges coupled high nutrient organic matter runoff encourages contracting parties identify support sustainable traditional well innovative uses wetlands biodiversity maintaining ecological character wetlands ensuring sustainable wise use wetlands fisheries crop cultivation reed harvesting wetland grazing mowing berry flower picking floodplain forestry search promote novel uses wetlands use integrated buffer zones constructed wetlands treatment agricultural runoff use degraded peatlands sphagnum moss cultivation kinds sustainable crop animal farming encourages contracting parties support develop guidance tools co management wetlands surface water resources groundwater resources wetland protection management cannot done isolation require active land use surface groundwater protection groundwater management integrated system needs monitored well understood order best management adaptation strategies devised encourages contracting parties strengthen role communication capacity building education participation awareness cepa enhance understanding communities wetlands agriculture co exist even benefit other notably a agriculture certain wetlands benefit high primary secondary productivity without compromising ecological integrity wetlands ramsar resolution xiii b wisely used wetlands continuously provide many beneficial products biomass building materials food fodder c wise use wetlands provides options receiving multiple benefits diverse production water retention landscape prevention floods stable groundwater storage reduced runoff nutrients preservation biodiversity carbon storage long water table sufficiently high large part season d natural wetlands also function refuges wild relatives crops e that thanks multiple benefits wetlands support human livelihoods well being encourages contracting parties work research institutions farmers stakeholders promote sustainability within farming practices agroforestry permaculture grazing aquaculture fisheries integrated production organic production sorjan farming around wetlands seek support basic applied research demonstration projects examine potential sustainable traditional novel wetland products production systems wetlands encourages contracting parties review and appropriate improve respective programmes policies support agricultural production assess effects wetlands sustainability including integrity wetlands long term impact upon sustainability local livelihoods also encourages contracting parties adapt appropriate incentive schemes consider criteria sustainable use natural resources conservation biological diversity prevention degradation ecosystems related wetlands encourages contracting parties national reports assess effectiveness comprehensiveness relevant domestic legislative regulatory wetland protection policy frameworks ensure wetlands located highly intensive agricultural landscapes necessary adequate protection place
