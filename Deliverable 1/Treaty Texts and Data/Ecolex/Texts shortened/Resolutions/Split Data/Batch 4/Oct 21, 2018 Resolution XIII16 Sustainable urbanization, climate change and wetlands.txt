extreme weather events ensure climate change responses would lead serious damage ecological character wetlands recognizing united nations framework convention climate change unfccc kyoto protocol paris agreement adopted unfccc primary multilateral agreements addressing climate change intergovernmental panel climate change ipcc leading international body assessing science related climate change also recognizing that third fourth fifth assessment reports ipcc concluded wetlands especially located areas high construction rates may undergo significant irreversible damage climate change due limited adaptive capacities wetlands vulnerability associated risks mindful ipcc special report impacts global warming c noting paragraph resolution xii refers decision x adopted convention biological

ecosystems thereby contributing climate change mitigation adaptation combating desertification aware resolution adopted united nations environment assembly united nations environment programme ecosystem based adaptation aware wetlands filter pollutants water flows reduce pollutant load wetlands downstream recognizing efforts successes many contracting parties rehabilitating restoring degraded wetlands benefits sharing practical methods experiences knowledge based best practice guidance noting paragraph annex resolution new urban agenda adopted united nations general assembly identifies principles commitments ensuring environmental sustainability promoting clean energy sustainable use land resources urban development protecting ecosystems biodiversity including adopting

appropriate modify re orient projects necessary ensure actions mitigate compensate adverse wetland impacts planned acknowledging ramsar wetland cities accreditation initiative assist cities contracting parties stakeholders promoting awareness attracting support wise use conservation wetlands sustainable development initiatives conference contracting parties encourages contracting parties prevent activities may adverse impact urban peri urban wetlands ramsar resolution xiii urges greater international national cooperation technical assistance capacity building address negative effects resulting activities negatively affect urban peri urban wetlands notably surrounding urban development climate change effluents pollution fragmentation ecosystems requests scientific technical review panel consistent scope mandate priority thematic work areas developing proposed work plan presentation meeting standing committee working cooperation interested contracting parties accredited wetland cities international organization partners consider following a developing technical guidelines design urban peri urban wetlands international importance ramsar sites using climate scenario climate modelling climate change analysis techniques well performing functional assessments wetlands using hydrogeomorphic methods b developing technical guidelines constructed urban peri urban water treatment wetlands would include ensuring water quality provision wildlife habitat based best available standards siting design construction operation maintenance monitoring constructed treatment wetlands bioremediation c developing technical guidelines set limits pollutant loads discharged urban wetlands depending pollutant load capacity d providing highest quality standard operating procedures urban peri urban development development adjacent ramsar sites e developing guidelines wise use management urban peri urban wetlands buffer zones considering factors related climate change ecosystem services functions also encourages contracting parties appropriate consider taking following actions regarding planning management wetlands a developing implementing management plans urban peri urban wetlands periodically monitoring changes wetlands sharing plans urban planning authorities encouraging embedding urban wetland protection plans setting goals municipal national planning programmes b implementing constructed urban peri urban wetland habitat enhancement activities integrating treatment systems use biomimetic processes involving native wetland vegetation soils associated microbial assemblages improve water quality enhance carbon sequestration potential resilience climate change impacts undertaking situ and or ex situ bioremediation wetlands c involving local stakeholders including limited national local governments private sector companies non governmental organizations research centres educational institutions bodies tourism heritage sectors indigenous peoples local communities planning protection management urban peri urban ramsar resolution xiii wetlands including establishment formal national urban wetlands stakeholder management
