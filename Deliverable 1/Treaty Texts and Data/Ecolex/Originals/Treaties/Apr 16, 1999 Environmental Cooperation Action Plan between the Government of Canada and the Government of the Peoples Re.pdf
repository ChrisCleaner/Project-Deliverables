<h3>
THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA<br>
AND<br>
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA&nbsp;</h3></center>
<b>BACKGROUND AND PROGRESS</b>
<p>In November 1998, the Government of Canada and the Government of the
People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the Parties) signed
The Framework Statement for Cooperation on Environment into the 21st Century
(hereinafter referred to as "the Framework Statement"). This is an important
document, which will guide our bilateral environmental cooperation relationship
into the 21st Century.
<p>Since the signature of the Framework Statement in November 1998, the
Parties have implemented the following projects and activities:
<ul>
<li>
On 9 - 11 December 1998, the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA)
and Environment Canada co-sponsored a Workshop on Atmospheric Observing
Systems which explored the application of new technologies, telecommunications
networks, data processing and dissemination systems, as well as network
strategy.</li>

<li>
On 22 - 25 March 1998, a Workshop on Pollution Control Technologies for
the Hai River Basin was convened in Beijing and addressed such issues as
waste water reutilization, ecosystem approaches to water management and
pollution prevention.</li>

<li>
On 30 March - 2 April, with Canadian assistance, an International Model
Forest Network workshop was held in Zhejiang to explore the possibility
for Linan to join the International Model Forest Network.</li>

<li>
On 5 - 18 April 1999, a CMA delegation visited Canada. The visit included
dialogue and exchange on modernization, disaster preparedness, commercial
activities and remote sensing, and provided an opportunity to focus on
innovative technology and networks related to climate change science and
environmental predictions including air quality, adaptation and impacts.</li>

<li>
On 12 - 13 April 1999, a Sino-Canadian workshop on Advancing Joint Collaboration
on Climate Change was convened in Beijing. The objectives of the workshop
were to help the Parties to identify potential cooperation activities,
develop a better understanding of China's capacity building and technology
needs and explore technological solutions to these needs.</li>
</ul>
<b>FUTURE COOPERATION</b>
<p>Under the umbrella of the Framework Statement, the Parties have agreed
on the main elements of a joint Action Plan for 1999-2000. Elements of
this Action Plan build on efforts related to a number of specific bilateral
agreements including the General Agreement on Development Cooperation between
the Government of Canada and the Government of the People's Republic of
China; the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperative Meteorological Programs;
the Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Cooperation and the Memorandum
of Understanding on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency.
<p>The elements of the Action Plan reflect a mutual interest in expanded
cooperation on a broad array of priority environmental issues and a desire
to develop and implement cooperation projects to address the challenges
associated with sustainable development and environment. This approach
has benefited both countries through ongoing cooperative accomplishments
in priority environmental areas including energy efficiency; cleaner production;
disaster mitigation; as well as natural resources conservation and watershed
management which, among other things, serve to enhance carbon sinks. This
Plan also reflects the successful working relationship that has developed
through the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment
and Development (CCICED) in support of the Chinese government's efforts
to promote sustainable development.
<p>The parties, through the involvement of various ministries, agencies
and stakeholders on both sides, will actively promote and pursue the cooperation
on the following projects and activities:
<p><b>1. Energy and environment</b>
<ul>
<li>
Clean energy and energy efficiency; inter-governmental research and cooperation
on technological exchanges for clean energy, energy efficiency and alternative
sources of energy which will help reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas
emissions;</li>

<li>
Urban air quality: inter-governmental research and cooperation on air quality
monitoring and gradual mitigation of urban air pollution from the perspective
of energy utilization.</li>
</ul>
<b>2. Pollution prevention</b>
<ul>
<li>
Cleaner production;</li>

<li>
Environmental technological verification - to develop policy options to
set up a program in China for environmental technological verification.</li>
</ul>
<b>3. Utilization and management of natural resources</b>
<ul>
<li>
Integrated poverty reduction and biodiversity protection in Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region;</li>

<li>
Sustainable agriculture and livestock production in the grasslands of Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region;</li>

<li>
Flood prevention and water resources management;</li>

<li>
Rehabilitation of small watersheds;</li>

<li>
Sustainable forestry;</li>

<li>
Sustainable management of China's nature reserves - to support the implementation
of China's Agenda 21 and Biodiversity Action Program through recommendations
of policies to improve the establishment and management of nature reserves
in China that protect biodiversity while supporting sustainable development.</li>
</ul>
<b>4. Capacity building</b>
<ul>
<li>
Assist with building the capacity of institutions in China, such as CAM,
in the management of human resources, risk analysis, performance measures
and the integration of complex systems;</li>

<li>
Linkages between researchers by sharing research methods and technologies,
collaborating on research themes, the exchanges of research data and results
and improved modelling;</li>

<li>
Environmental management of public sector operations.</li>
</ul>
<b>5. China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development</b>
<ul>
<li>
To continue strengthening the activities under the framework of the CCICED;</li>
</ul>
<b>6. Others</b>
<p>The Parties, through consultations involving various ministries, agencies
and stakeholders, will develop and implement other projects of mutual interest.
<p><b>THE WAY FORWARD</b>
<p>In addition to proceeding with the above initiatives, both Parties are
in the process of establishing the Canada-China Joint Committee on Environment
Cooperation so as to better coordinate activities and projects. The Canadian
side will follow a strongly coordinated Team Canada approach with Environment
Canada leading and many agencies, departments and stakeholders involved
in the work of the Joint Committee. The Chinese side will be led by the
State Environmental Protection Administration, with many agencies involved
in the work of the Joint Committee.
<p>The Inaugural Meeting will be held in China in the summer or fall of
1999. Canada agrees to host the second meeting in March 2000 in Vancouver.
At the first meeting, the Joint Committee will review progress to ensure
that the Framework Statement remains responsive to emerging environmental
problems of mutual concerns.
