Eastern Pacific Ocean Tuna Fishing Agreement

The Contracting Parties to this Agreement:

Resolved to cooperate for the purpose of ensuring the conservation and rational utilization of tuna
resources in the Eastern Pacific Ocean,

Bearing in mind that tuna cover a broad area which, in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, includes jurisdictional
zones of a varying nature declared by the coastal States and a considerable portion of the seas in which
coastal States do not exercise any jurisdiction,

Recognizing that a tuna conservation regime for the Eastern Pacific Ocean cannot be effective and
equitable unless it is comprehensive and has the participation of all States that fish tuna in that region
an a meaningful scale in relation to conservation requirements,

Convinced that it is essential to establish, pending conclusion of a comprehensive regional tuna
conservation regime, an interim regime, taking into account the jurisdictional zones declared by many
coastal States of the Eastern Pacific Ocean as well as the highly migratory character of tuna,

Have agreed as follows,


Article I

The Contracting Parties agree to establish an interim regime for the management of fishing activities of
tuna vessels in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, based on a scheme for granting licences in the region, which
guarantees rational exploitation of the resources and equitable access to the fishing areas.

Article II

For the purpose of this Agreement, the Contracting Parties agree that:
A - "Coastal States" means States bordering the area described in paragraph B of this Article.
B - The "Agreement Area" means the following:
From the point on the mainland where the parallel of 40oN latitude intersects the coast westward along
the parallel of 40oN latitude to 40oN latitude by 125oW longitude, thence southerly along the meridian of
125oW longitude to 20oN latitude by 125oW longitude, then easterly along the parallel of 20oN latitude to
20oN latitude by 120oW longitude, thence southerly along the meridian of 120oW longitude to 5oN
latitude by 120oW longitude, thence easterly along the parallel of 5oN latitude to 5oN latitude by 110oW

the areas within 12 nautical miles of the baseline from which the breadth of territorial sea Is measured
and those areas within 200 nautical miles of the baseline of coastal States not signatories to this
Agreement, measured from the same baseline. The Agreement area may be adjusted according to the

Protocol to the Eastern Pacific Ocean tuna Fishing Agreement
A 1- If the Agreement enters into force with five Contracting Parties, the fee for a fishing licence shall be
US$60 (sixty dollars) per net registered ton of the vessel requesting the licence.
2 - For each additional Contracting Party which is a coastal State, the Council shall adjust the licence
fee up to a maximum of US$100 (one hundred dollars) per net registered ton. For this purpose, the
Council shall take into account, inter alia, the amount of tuna taken within 200 nautical miles from the
baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of the coastal State ratifying or adhering to this
Agreement is measured.
The minimum increase in the fee for each additional coastal State ratifying or adhering, after the sixth,
shall be US$10 (ten dollars) per net registered ton. The minimum increase for the sixth coastal State
may be more than, or less than, US$10 (ten dollars) per net registered ton, also as determined by the
Council.
3 - Upon withdrawal by any coastal State, the licence fee shall be decreased, taking into account, inter
alia, the amount of tuna taken within 200 nautical miles of the aforementioned baselines of the coastal
State withdrawing from the Agreement. However, in no case shall the fee be less than US$60 (sixty
dollars) per net registered ton.
B - Licences may be purchased at any time upon full payment of the established fee. Licences shall be
valid until 31 December of each year and allow access to fishing in the Agreement area.
C - Any Contracting Party's vessel with a net registered tonnage of 700 tons or less may obtain licences
on a semi-annual rather than on an annual basis. The fee for a semi-annual licence shall be one-half of
the annual fee.
D - Licences shall not be required of vessels with a net registered tonnage of 700 tons or less which fish
exclusively within 200 nautical miles of the aforementioned baselines of their flag State. However, the
flag State shall notify the Director of the names, registrations, tonnages and catches of such vessels.
E - For the purpose of the Agreement and this Protocol, the term "tons" refers to short tons.
F - After deducting an appropriate percentage of the total fees for administrative costs, but in no case
more than 10 percent of the annual total, the Council shall disburse annually the balance of all fees to
the coastal Stales in proportion to the amount of tuna taken within 200 nautical miles of the
aforementioned baselines during the year in which the licences are issued. For the purposes of such
disbursement, the Council in accordance with paragraph G of this Protocol may request, in addition,
data from any competent international agency or organization.
G 1- All licensed vessels shall provide written reports on the size of the catches taken in the Agreement
Area making specific mention of the coordinates of where the catches were made. These data shall be
entered in the log book of each vessel.
2. These data shall be confidential and shall not be used for any purpose other than as specifically
provided by the Agreement and this Protocol.
3- The Director shall transmit to the Council aggregate data by area and size of catch.
4- The Council shall determine the mechanisms of collection and analysis of these data.
5- In accordance with Article VI(B) of the Agreement, each Contracting Party shall establish and enforce
appropriate penalties for failure of its vessels to comply with their obligations set forth in this Protocol.
H - The Contracting Parties will consult, as appropriate, with other States with a view to agreeing on the
conditions of participation in this Agreement.
