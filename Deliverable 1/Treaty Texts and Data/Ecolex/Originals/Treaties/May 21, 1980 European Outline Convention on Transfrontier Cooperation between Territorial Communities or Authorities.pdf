EUROPEAN OUTLINE CONVENTION ON TRANSFRONTIER CO-OPERATION
BETWEEN TERRITORIAL COMMUNITIES OR AUTHORITIES 

Madrid, 21 May 1980

      The Member States of the Council of Europe, signatories to this
Convention;

      Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve
a greater unity between its members and to promote co-operation between
them:

      Considering that, as defined in Article 1 of the Council of
Europe Statute, this aim will be pursued in particular by agreements
in the administrative field;

      Considering that the Council of Europe shall ensure the
participation of the territorial communities or authorities of Europe
in the achievement of its aim;

      Considering the potential importance, for the pursuit of this
objective, of co-operation between territorial communities or
authorities of frontiers in such fields as regional, urban and rural
development, environmental protection, the improvement of public
facilities and services and mutual assistance in emergencies;

      Having regard to past experience which shows that co-operation
between local and regional authorities in Europe makes it easier for
them to carry out their tasks effectively and contributes in
particular to the improvement and development of frontier regions;

      Being resolved to promote such co-operation as far as possible
and to contribute in this way to the economic and social progress of
frontier regions and to the spirit of fellowship which unites the
peoples of Europe;

      Have agreed as follows:


Article 1

      Each Contracting Party undertakes to facilitate and foster
transfrontier co-operation between territorial communities or
authorities within its jurisdiction and territorial communities or
authorities within the jurisdiction of other Contracting Parties. It
shall endeavour to promote the conclusion of any agreements and
arrangements that may prove necessary for this purpose with due regard
to the different constitutional provisions of each Party.


Article 2

1.    For the purpose of the Convention, transfrontier co-operation
shall mean any concerted action designed to reinforce and foster
neighbourly relations between territorial communities or authorities
within the jurisdiction of two or more Contracting Parties and the
conclusion of any agreement and arrangement necessary for this
purpose.  Transfrontier co-operation shall take place in the framework
of territorial communities' or authorities' powers as defined in
domestic law. The scope and nature of such powers shall not be altered
by this Convention. 

2.    For the purpose of this Convention, the expression "territorial
communities or authorities" shall mean communities, authorities or
bodies exercising local and regional functions and regarded as such
under the domestic law of each State.  However, each Contracting Party
may, at the time of signing this Convention or by subsequent
notification to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, name
the communities, authorities or bodies, subjects and forms to which it
intends to confine the scope of the Convention or which it intends to
exclude from its scope.


Article 3

1.    For the purpose of this Convention the Contracting Parties  
shall, subject to the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 2, encourage
any initiative by territorial communities and authorities inspired by
the outline arrangements between territorial communities and
authorities drawn up in the Council of Europe.  If they judge
necessary they may take into consideration the bilateral or
multilateral inter-state model agreements drawn up in the Council of
Europe and designed to facilitate co-operation between territorial
communities and authorities.

      The arrangements and agreements concluded may be based on the
model and outline agreements, statutes and contracts appended to this
Convention, numbered 1.1 to 1.5 and 2.1 to 2.6, with whatever 
changes are required by the particular situation of each Contracting
Party.  These model and outline agreements, statutes and contracts are
intended for guidance only and have no treaty value.

2.    If the Contracting Parties deem it necessary to conclude inter-
state agreements, these may, inter alia, establish the context, forms
and limits within which territorial communities and authorities
concerned with transfrontier co-operation may act.  Each agreement may
also stipulate the authorities or bodies to which it applies.

3.    The above provisions shall not prevent the Contracting Parties
from having recourse, by common consent, to other forms of
transfrontier co-operation. Similarly, the provisions of this
Convention should not be interpreted as invalidating existing
agreements on co-operation.

4.    Agreements and arrangements shall be concluded with due regard
to the jurisdiction provided for by the internal law of each
Contracting Party in respect of international relations and general
policy and to any rules of control or supervision to which territorial
communities or authorities may be subject.

5.    To that end, any Contracting Party may, when signing the present
Convention or in a later communication to the Secretary General of the
Council of Europe, specify the authorities competent under its
domestic law to exercise control or supervision with regard to the
territorial communities and authorities concerned.


Article 4

      Each Contracting Party shall endeavour to resolve any legal,
administrative or technical difficulties liable to hamper the
development and smooth running of transfrontier co-operation and  
shall consult with the other Contracting Party or Parties concerned to
the extent required.


Article 5

      The Contracting Parties shall consider the advisability of
granting to territorial communities or authorities engaging in 
transfrontier co-operation in accordance with the provisions of this
Convention the same facilities at national level.


Article 6

      Each Contracting Party shall supply to the fullest possible
extent any information requested by another Contracting Party in order
to facilitate the performance by the latter of its obligations under
this Convention.


Article 7

      Each Contracting Party shall see to it that the territorial
communities or authorities concerned are informed of the means of 
action open to them under the Convention.


Article 8

      The Contracting Parties shall forward to the Secretary General
of the Council of Europe all relevant information  concerning the
agreements and arrangements provided for in Article 3.

2.    Any proposal made by one or more Contracting Parties with a view
to adding to or extending this Convention or the model agreements and
arrangements shall be communicated to the Secretary General of the
Council of Europe. The Secretary General shall then submit it to the
Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe which shall decide on
the action to be taken.


Article 9

1.    This Convention shall be open to signature by the member States
of the Council of Europe. It shall be subject to ratification,
acceptance or approval. Instruments of ratification,  acceptance or
approval shall be deposited with the Secretary General of the Council
of Europe.

2.    The Convention shall enter into force three months after the date
of the deposit of the fourth instrument of ratification, acceptance or
approval, that at least two of the States having carried out this
formality possess a common frontier.

3.    In respect of a signatory State ratifying, accepting or approving
subsequently, the Convention shall come into force three months after
the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance
or approval.


Article 10

1.    After the entry into force of this Convention, the Committee of
Ministers of the Council of Europe may decide unanimously to invite
any European non-member State to accede thereto.  This invitation must
receive the express agreement of each of the States which have
ratified the Convention.

2.    Such accession shall be effected by depositing with the Secretary
General of the Council of Europe an instrument of accession which
shall take effect three months after the date of its deposit.


Article 11

1.    Any Contracting Party may, in so far as it is concerned, denounce
this Convention by means of a notification addressed to the Secretary
General of the Council of Europe.

2.    Such denunciation shall take effect six months after the date of
receipt by the Secretary General of such notification.


Article 12

      The Secretary General of the Council of Europe shall notify the
member States of the Council of Europe, and any State that has acceded
to this Convention of:

a)    any signature;

b)    any deposit of an instrument of ratification, acceptance,
approval or accession;

c)    any date of entry into force of this Convention in accordance
with Article 9 thereof;

d)    any declaration received in pursuance of the provisions of
paragraph 2 of Article 2 or of paragraph 5 of Article 3;

e)    any notification received in pursuance of the provisions of
Article 11 and the date on which denunciation takes effect.


In witness whereof the undersigned, being duly authorised thereto,
have signed this Convention.

Done at Madrid, the 21st day of May 1980 in English and in French,
both texts being equally authentic, in a single copy which shall be
deposited in the archives of the Council of Europe.  The Secretary
General of the Council of Europe shall transmit certified copies to
each member State of the Council of Europe and to any State invited to
accede to this Convention.


Appendix I

MODEL AND OUTLINE AGREEMENTS, STATUTES AND CONTRACTS ON TRANSFRONTIER
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN TERRITORIAL COMMUNITIES OR AUTHORITIES [1]

      This graduated system of model agreements was devised by
distinguishing between two main categories defined according to the
level at which the agreement is concluded:

 -     model inter-state agreements on transfrontier co-operation at
       local and regional level; 
 -     outline agreements, contracts and statutes capable of providing 
       a basis for transfrontier co-operation between territorial
       authorities or communities.

      As shown in the table below, only the two model inter-state
agreements for the promotion of transfrontier co-operation and
regional transfrontier liaison fall exclusively within the
jurisdiction of States.  The other inter-state agreements merely
establish a legal framework for the conclusion of agreements or   
contracts between territorial authorities or communities, the outlines 
of which have been placed in the second category.


1.    MODEL INTER-STATE AGREEMENTS

      General clauses for model agreements

1.1   Model inter-state agreement for the promotion of transfrontier
      co-operation;

1.2   Model inter-state agreement on regional transfrontier
      consultation;

1.3   Model inter-state agreement on local transfrontier consultation;

1.4   Model inter-state agreement on contractual transfrontier co-
      operation between local authorities;

1.5   Model inter-state agreement on organs of transfrontier co-
      operation between local authorities.


2.    OUTLINE AGREEMENTS, STATUTES AND CONTRACTS BETWEEN LOCAL
      AUTHORITIES

2.1   Outline agreement on the setting up of a consultation group
      between local authorities;

2.2   Outline agreement on co-ordination in the management of
      transfrontier local public affairs;

2.3   Outline agreement on the setting up of private law transfrontier
      associations;

2.4   Outline contract for the provision of supplies or services
      between local authorities in frontier areas (private-law type);

2.5   Outline contract for the provision of supplies or services
      between local authorities in frontier areas (public-law type); 

2.6   Outline agreement on the setting up of organs of transfrontier
      co-operation between local authorities.


1.    MODEL INTER-STATE AGREEMENTS 

      Introductory note:

      The system of inter-state agreements aims above all to define
precisely the context, forms and limits which States favour for
territorial authority action, and to eliminate legal uncertainties
likely to create problems (definition of the applicable law, judicial
authorities, possible avenues of appeal, etc.).

      Further, the conclusion of inter-state agreements between the
States concerned promoting transfrontier co-operation between local
authorities would undoubtedly be advantageous in the following
respects:


 -     official recognition of the legitimacy of such co-operation
       procedures and encouragement for local authorities to use them;

 -     purpose and conditions of intervention by supervisory or
       controlling authorities;

 -     exchange of information between States; 
       links which may be established between such forms of
       co-operation and other procedures for concerted action in
       frontier areas;

 -     amendment of legal rules or interpretations thereof which hinder
       transfrontier co-operation, etc.

      The system of multiple choice model agreements described above
enables governments to place frontier co-operation within whatever
context is best suited to their needs by using the inter-state
agreement for the promotion of transfrontier co-operation (1.1) as a
foundation and supplementing it with any of the various options (model
agreements 1.2 to 1.5). States could have recourse either to one
option only or to more or even all of them, and they could do so
either simultaneously or in stages. In the case of agreements between
States which already have similar legal systems, such as the
Scandinavian States, recourse to agreements of such a specific kind
might prove unnecessary.

entry into force.  Unless six months' notice of termination be given
prior to its expiry, it shall be tacitly renewed on the same terms for
successive further periods of five years.

applies only to specified articles, geographical regions or fields of
activity. In such a case, the agreement shall remain in force for the
remainder, unless terminated by the other Party or Parties within four
months of receiving notice of partial termination.

4.    The Parties may at any time suspend application of the present
agreements for a specific period. They may similarly agree that the
activity of a particular committee be suspended or discontinued.

customs regulation, foreign exchange and capital transfer rules and
procedures governing intervention by higher authorities, particularly
as regards supervision or control.

      Before taking the steps referred to in the above sub-paragraph,
the Parties shall consult with each other as necessary and exchange

1.3   INTER-STATE AGREEMENT ON LOCAL TRANSFRONTIER CONSULTATION

      Introductory note:

      This agreement may be concluded either individually or in
conjunction with one or more of the model inter-state agreements
(Texts 1.1 to 1.5).


Article 1

      With a view to ensuring a fuller exchange of information and
developing consultation between local authorities on either side of
frontiers, the Parties call on such authorities to make a joint study
of problems of common interest through consultation committees.


Article 2

      The rules of procedure of such committees shall be agreed by
their members. Higher authorities shall be associated with their
proceedings or kept informed of them.

      The consultation committees shall be associated with the work of
regional transfrontier consultation commissions on terms to be decided
by the latter, should such commissions have been set up in the regions
in question.  Similarly, these commissions shall give their assistance
to the work of the consultation committees.

      They may also act as advisory bodies in connection with the
implementation of special inter-state agreements concluded in the
context of transfrontier co-operation.


Article 3

      The function of the consultation committees shall be to organise
exchanges of information and consultations on both sides as well as to
study matters of common interest and determine common aims.

      Their activities shall be governed by respect for the
responsibilities of their members and no transfer of powers shall be
involved.

      The members of these committees may, however, within the
framework of co-operation agreements, decide together what measures or
restrictions are to guide their respective activities or what
preliminary consultation procedures they wish to see followed.


Article 4 (alternative)

      To assist these consultation committees in their work, the local
authorities concerned may, within the limits of the powers conferred
on them under domestic law, form associations to provide a legal
framework for their co-operation.

      Such associations shall be set up under the civil law or
commercial law applicable to associations in one of the States
concerned.  For the application of the legal system chosen, should the
occasion arise, the conditions, formalities and particular
authorizations concerning the nationality of members of the
associations should be disregarded.

      The information provided to the higher authorities, conforming
to Article 2, will include all information on the activities of the
associations mentioned in the present article.


1.4   MODEL INTER-STATE AGREEMENT ON CONTRACTUAL TRANSFRONTIER CO-
      OPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES

      Introductory note: 

      This agreement may be concluded either individually or in
conjunction with one or more of the draft inter-state agreements
(Texts 1.1 to 1.5).


Article 1

      Transfrontier co-operation between local authorities shall be
conducted, inter alia, by means of administrative, economic or
technical contracts.


Article 2

      Transfrontier co-operation contracts shall be concluded by local
authorities within the limits of their powers under domestic law.

      They shall, inter alia, relate to the provision of supplies or
services, the taking of joint action, the creation of associations
established on the basis of civil or commercial law of one of the
States parties or the membership of such an association.[5]


Article 3

      The Parties to such a contract shall specify the law applicable
thereto by reference to the law of contracts (both public and private)
of one of the States parties to this agreement.

      They shall also specify, as far as is necessary, those
derogations that may be made from such provisions of that law as are
not binding.

      Failing any relevant stipulation in the contract, the law
applicable shall be that of the State of whichever local authority is
responsible thereunder for providing the principal service, or failing
this, the local authority with the most important financial
involvement.

      Under all circumstances the persons subject to the local
authorities parties to the contract shall retain any right to take
action against or seek remedy from the said authorities which they
would have enjoyed with regard to the authorities if the latter had
retained their duty to provide the said persons with the supplies or
services in question.  The local authorities against which such action
is taken or from which remedies are sought shall be entitled to
institute proceedings against those local authorities which have
assumed responsibility for providing the supplies or services.


Article 4

      Proposals for the conclusion or amendment of contracts shall be 
simultaneously subject in each State to the ordinary rules governing 
intervention by higher authorities. However, no approval shall be
required from authorities parties to the contract. Any decision taken 
by a higher authority which may prevent the conclusion or application,
or which may provoke the cancellation, of a transfrontier co-operation
contract, should imply previous consultation with the corresponding
higher authorities of the other States concerned.


Article 5

      In the event of a dispute the competent judicial authority shall
be determined by the applicable law. However, transfrontier co-
operation contracts may include arbitration clauses. Notwithstanding
any such clauses users and third parties shall retain any existing
legal remedies against the local authorities of the State to which
they belong, it lying with those authorities to seek redress against
the defaulting co-contractor.

      Higher authorities shall take all measures in their power to
secure the prompt execution of judicial decisions, whatever the
nationality of the court from which they emanated.


Article 6

      Contracts concluded under this agreement shall remain in effect
after its denunciation. However, the contracts will include a clause
authorizing the parties to terminate such contracts, subject to five
years' notice, in the event of the denunciation of the present
agreement. The States parties will have the power to bring about the
application of this clause.


1.5   MODEL INTER-STATE AGREEMENT ON ORGANS OF TRANSFRONTIER CO-
      OPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES

      Introductory note:

      This agreement may be concluded either individually or in 
conjunction  with one or more of the model inter-state agreements
(Texts 1.1 to 1.5).


Article 1

      For the purposes which they are permitted under domestic law to
pursue through an association or consortium, local authorities and
other public-law bodies may take part in associations or consortia of

Article 2

      Within the limits of their members' powers, the associations or
consortia referred to in Article 1 shall be entitled to pursue their 
activities arising out of their statutory purpose in the territory of 
each of the Parties concerned. In so doing, they shall be subject to
the rules laid down by that State, unless exceptions are allowed by
that State.


Article 3

      The instrument of establishment of association or consortium, 
the articles of association and any alterations thereto shall be
subject to approval by the higher authorities of all the local
authorities participating. The same shall apply to admission to an
already existing association or consortium.

2.    The population concerned shall be notified of such instruments
and the approval thereof, in accordance with each country's normal
publicity arrangements. The same shall apply to any change in official
headquarters and to any decisions regarding the persons authorised to
act on behalf of the association or consortium and the limits of their
powers.

3.    The above instruments shall be drawn up in the official languages
in use in each of the States where they are to have effect.  Each such
version of the text shall be authentic.


Article 4

1.    The articles of association shall specify rules governing the
association's or consortium's relations in law. They shall include the
subjects required by the relevant legislation, in accordance with
Article 1. In every case, they shall designate its members, its name
and its headquarters.  They shall determine the purpose of the
association or consortium and, where appropriate, the functions of its
installations and the location thereof.  They shall determine the
manner of appointment of the managerial and administrative bodies, the
extent of the members' obligations and their contribution to joint
expenditure.  The management bodies shall include at least one
representative of the member local authorities of each country. The
articles of association shall determine the composition and the mode
of deliberation of the General Assembly, the form of minutes of
sittings, the mode of dissolution or liquidation and the rules
governing budgets and accounts.

2.    The articles shall also include a provision whereby members may
withdraw from the association giving a period of notice which will be
fixed by the articles, after settlement of any debts to the
association and on payment to the association of compensation, as
assessed by experts, in respect of investment effected or expenditure
incurred by the association for or on behalf of the members concerned.
They shall also specify rules governing members' dismissal or
exclusion for failure to honour undertakings.


Article 5

      The Parties undertake to give the authorization necessary to the
accomplishment within their territory by the association or consortium
of its task, subject to the requirements of public policy and public
safety.


Article 6

      Where, pursuant to domestic law, the association or consortium
may not, on the territory of a State, exercise certain powers, rights
or advantages necessary to the accomplishment of its task for the
benefit of that State's member local authorities, the latter shall
have the right and the duty to act for and on behalf of the
association or consortium for the purpose of exercising or securing
these powers, rights or advantages.


Article 7

1.    Powers of supervision or control over theassociation or
consortium shall be exercised, in accordance with domestic law, by the
responsible authorities of the State in which its headquarters are
located.  Such authorities shall also ensure that the interests of
local authorities of other States are safeguarded.


2.    The responsible authorities of the other States shall have a
right to information on the activities and decisions of the
association or consortium and on action taken in the exercise of
supervision or control. They shall, in particular, be supplied on
request with the adopted texts and minutes of meetings of the bodies
of the association or consortium, the annual accounts and the draft
budget, if any, insofar as domestic law requires that these be
communicated to the authorities responsible for supervision or
control.  They may communicate directly with the bodies of the
association or consortium and with the supervisory or controlling
authorities, submit observations to them or ask to be directly
consulted in specific instances and on specific matters.

3.    The responsible authorities of the other States shall also have
the right to notify the association or consortium that they object to
those authorities falling under their jurisdiction continuing to take
part in the association or consortium.  Such notification, duly
justified, shall be deemed to be grounds for exclusion and shall be
specified as such in the association's articles.  The authorities
referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall also be
entitled to be represented by a delegate to the management bodies of
the association or consortium; such delegate shall be entitled to
attend all the bodies' meetings and to receive their agendas and
minutes.


Article 8

      The supplies or services with which the association or consortium
is to be entrusted, in accordance with its articles, in the territory
of its members shall be provided on its responsibility, thereby
completely releasing its members from their obligations in respect
thereof.  The association or consortium shall also be responsible vis-
a-vis, users and third parties.  The latter shall, however, retain,
with regard to the local authorities for and on whose behalf the
supplies or services are provided, all such rights of action and legal
remedy as they would enjoy if the authorities themselves had retained
the obligation to provide them with the supplies and services
concerned.  The authorities against whom such action or recourse is
directed may themselves take action against the association.


Article 9

1.    Failing conciliation, disputes between the association and its
members, or between several members, regarding its operation shall be
referred to the administrative and judicial authorities of the State
in which the headquarters of the association or consortium are
located.

2.    All disputes other than those referred to in paragraph 1 may be
referred to the administrative and judicial authorities according to
the ordinary rules applying in the territory of the States parties
unless those interested decide to refer such disputes to a tribunal
which they may designate.

3.    The States parties will take the necessary measures in order to
ensure the execution on their territory of decisions and judgments,
relating to the above provisions.

Article 10

      The associations or consortia created according to this agreement
shall remain in effect after the denunciation of this agreement,
though without prejudice to the provisions of Article 7, paragraph 3.

2.    OUTLINE AGREEMENTS, STATUTES AND CONTRACTS BETWEEN LOCAL
      AUTHORITIES

      Introductory note:

OUTLINE AGREEMENTS, CONTRACTS AND STATUTES INTENDED FOR LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES

      Like States, local authorities could be offered a choice of
agreements and contracts.  In fact, such a choice already exists in a
number of countries, as is shown by the appreciable volume of
documentation on agreements concluded that has already been assembled.

      The proposed system comprises six outline agreements, contracts
and statutes corresponding to different degrees and formulae of local
transfrontier co-operation.  According to the scope and state of
national legislation, these outlines may either be put to immediate
use or may be subordinated to the adoption of an inter-state agreement
governing their use.

      In general, the conclusion of inter-state agreements, even when
it does not seem absolutely essential, could help to clarify the
conditions on which these agreements may be used by the local
authorities.  In any event, the conclusion of an interstate agreement
would seem to be a prerequisite for recourse to the agreement numbered
2.6 (transfrontier co-operation organs).

      This system of outline agreements intended for local authorities 
corresponds to the model inter-state agreements. Reference is made to 
the inter-state agreements in the introductory note to each outline.

      It is then possible to integrate the agreements and organs set
up at local level, into the structures of transfrontier consultation
to be set up at regional or national level. For example, the local
liaison committees (outline 2.1) could be integrated into the
structure of the Commissions, Committees and working parties 
stipulated in the model inter-state agreement on regional
transfrontier consultation (1.2).

      Also, these models have been designed on a schematic basis, as
it was not possible to take a global view of all the problems that
could arise in each particular case. The outlines are a valuable guide,
but may be amended according to the needs encountered by the local
authorities using them.

      Likewise, local authorities must determine means of encouraging 
citizen participation in transfrontier consultation in the socio-
cultural sphere. Such participation would certainly overcome the
psychological obstacles sometimes seriously impeding transfrontier 
co-operation. Consultation, supported by public interest, would also
benefit from a solid foundation. One way of encouraging public
participation would be to have recourse to an association. Thus, one 
of the outlines (2.3) concerns the setting up of a private law
association.


2.1   OUTLINE AGREEMENT ON THE SETTING UP OF A CONSULTATION GROUP 
      BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES

      Introductory note:

      Normally, the creation of such a group is possible without the 
need for inter-state agreements. There are numerous examples of such 
a possibility. However, if legal or other uncertainties exist, an
inter-state agreement would provide the conditions under which such 
consultation could be used (see model agreement 1.3).

PURPOSE OF THE GROUP AND HEADQUARTERS


Article 1

      The local authorities Parties to this agreement undertake to co-
ordinate their efforts in the following fields within their powers
(specify the field(s) of responsibility or refer to "local problems"). 
For this purpose, they hereby establish a Consultation Group,
hereinafter referred to as "the Group", with headquarters at ....

      The Group's function shall be to ensure the exchange of
information, co-ordination and consultation between its members in the 
fields specified in the preceding sub-paragraph. The member  
authorities undertake to supply it with information necessary for the 
discharge of its function and to consult each other, via the Group,
prior to the adoption of decisions or measures affecting the fields
specified above.


MEMBERSHIP


Article 2

      Each participating local authority shall be represented in the
Group by a delegation of . . . members appointed by it.  Each delega-
tion may, with the Group's agreement, be accompanied by
representatives of private socio-economic bodies and by experts (this
alternative excludes entities other than local authorities from
membership, which distinguishes this arrangement from the private law
association dealt with under 2.3).

      Possible variant: The number of members in each delegation may
vary.  Membership shall be open to local and regional authorities,
socio-economic groups and private persons subscribing to this
agreement. The Group shall decide on the admission of new members. 
Each delegation may, with the Group's agreement, be accompanied by
representatives of private bodies and by experts.


TERMS OF REFERENCE


Article 3

      The Group may deliberate on all matters specified in Article 1.
All questions on which a consensus is reached, and recommendations
which the Group decides to make to the relevant authorities or groups,
shall be recorded in the minutes.

      The Group shall be authorised to commission studies and
investigations on matters within its competence.


Article 4

      The members of the Group may agree to entrust the Group with the
execution of certain well-defined practical duties.  The Group may
also carry out any tasks entrusted to it by other agencies.


OPERATION


Article 5

      The Group shall draw up its own rules of procedure.


Article 6

      The Group shall, as a general rule, be convened twice a year, or
at the request of one-third of its members proposing the entry of an
item on its agenda.

       Notice of the meeting must be given and the agenda circulated
at least 15 days in advance, in order that the deliberations may be
prepared by each of the institutions represented.


Article 7

      The Group shall appoint from among its members a permanent Bureau
whose membership and powers it shall determine.

      The Chair shall be taken in accordance with the rules of
procedure or, where they do not apply, by the oldest member present.


RELATIONS WITH OUTSIDE PERSONS AND HIGHER AUTHORITIES


Article 8

      In relations with outside persons, the Group shall be represented
by its Chairman, except as otherwise provided for in the rules of
procedure. Higher authorities, to which members of the Group belong,
may obtain from the Group such information as they may request on the
Group's work and shall be authorized to send an observer to its
meetings.


SECRETARIAT AND FINANCE


Article 9

      Secretarial services shall be provided by one of the member
institutions (with or without a system of annual replacement). 

      Each authority shall be required to contribute to the cost of
secretarial services as specified hereunder: . . . . . . . . . . . .
.. . . . . . . . . . . Information and documentation shall normally be
circulated in the language of the State from which it originates. 


ACCESSION AND WITHDRAWAL



Article 10

      Membership of the Group shall be open to such additional local
and regional authorities as may subscribe to this agreement. The Group
shall decide on the admission of new members.


Article 11

      Any member may withdraw from the Group by notifying the Chairman
to that effect.  The withdrawal of a member from the Group shall not
affect its operation unless otherwise decided upon by the Group.


Article 12

       The Parties shall inform the Secretary General of the Council
of Europe of the conclusion of this agreement and supply him with the
text.


2.2   OUTLINE AGREEMENT ON CO-ORDINATION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF
      TRANSFRONTIER LOCAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS

      Introductory note:

      In several States this type of transfrontier co-operation
agreement is already possible.  Where this is not the case, the
conditions under which such an agreement could be used should be
defined within the framework of an inter-state agreement (see model
agreement 1.3).


PURPOSE OF THE AGREEMENT


Article 1

      Article 1 specifies the purpose of the agreement (e.g. harmonious
development of frontier regions) and the fields concerned.


TERRITORY COVERED BY THE AGREEMENT


Article 2

      Article 2 should specify the territories covered by the agreement
on either side (or on all three sides) of the frontier.


UNDERTAKINGS


Article 3

      Article 3 should define the means of achieving the aims of the
agreement (Article 1).  According to the material purpose of the
agreement, the following undertakings may be specified:

 -     the Parties undertake to comply with a prior consultation
       procedure before reaching decisions on a number of measurs they
       have to take within the limits of their powers and of the
       territory administered by them;  

 -     the Parties undertake, within their territory and within the
       limits of their powers, to take the measures necessary to the
       achievement of the  agreement's objectives;

 -     the Parties undertake to do nothing detrimental to the
       objectives agreement.


CO-ORDINATION


Article 4

      Article 4 should specify, in accordance with the particular
circumstances and requirements of each agreement, the arrangements for
co_ordination:

 -     either by designating for co-ordination purposes the general
       purpose group referred to in outline agreement 2.1; 

 -     or by providing for the establishment of a specific consultation
       group for the purpose of this agreement;

 -     or simply by means of direct bilateral contracts between the
       authorities concerned.


CONCILIATION


Article 5

      Each member of the Group (each Party, if there is no Group) may 
raise with the Group (the other Party, if there is no Group) any case 
in which it considers that the agreement has not been observed in that:

 -     either there has been no prior consultation;

 -     or the measures taken are not in keeping with the agreement;

 -     or the measures necessary to the achievement of the aims of the
       agreement have not been taken.

If the Parties fail to reach agreement, the dispute may be referred to 
a Conciliation Board entrusted with ensuring compliance with the
undertakings entered into.


Article 7

      The Parties shall inform the Secretary General of the conclusion 
of this agreement and supply him with the text.


2.3   OUTLINE AGREEMENTS ON THE SETTING UP OF PRIVATE LAW TRANSFRONTIER
      ASSOCIATION

      Introductory note:

      It is assumed that the local authority of one State may belong
to a private law association of another State in accordance with the
same rules and conditions as apply to that local authority's membership
of a private law association in its own State. If such is not the case
at present,the possibility should be expressly provided for by means
of an inter-state agreement between the States concerned (see
inter-state model agreements 1.3 and 1.4).

      Private associations are normally required to comply with rules 
laid down in the law of the country where they have their headquarters.
The following list shows the provisions which should be included in
their Articles, where this is not specified by law. The provisions
governing consultation groups (see outline agreement 2.1) may also
apply, mutatis mutandis, to associations of this type.

     The association's Articles should specify:

1.   its founder members and the conditions for the admission of new
     members;

2.   its name, headquarters and legal form (with reference to the
     relevant national legislation);

3.   its object, the manner of achieving this object and the resources
     at the association's disposal;

4.    its bodies and in particular the functions and mode of operation 
      of its General Assembly (representation and  voting);

5.    appointment of administrators or executive officers and their
      powers;

6.    the extent of members' liabilities vis-a-vis third parties;

7.    conditions for modification of the Articles and for winding-up
      of the association;

8.    an undertaking by the Parties to inform the Secretary General of
      the Council of Europe of the formation of a transfrontier
      association and to supply him with its Articles.


2.4   OUTLINE CONTRACT FOR THE PROVISION OF SUPPLIES OF SERVICES
      BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN FRONTIER AREAS ("PRIVATE-LAW" TYPE)

      Introductory note:

      It is assumed that local authorities have the right to conclude
such a contract with local authorities of other countries. Where this
is not the case, this possibility should be expressly provided for
within the framework of an inter-state agreement (see model agreement
1.4)

      This is a type of contract which may be used by local authorities
for sales, leases, works contracts, the supply of goods or services,
the granting of operating concessions, etc. Local authorities' use of
"private-law" contracts is permitted to varying degrees in national
legislation and practice and it is difficult to draw the line between
"public-law" and "private-law" contracts. Nevertheless it may be
assumed that this type of contract may be used wherever according to
the prevailing interpretation in each particular country, the agreement
concerns an operation of a commercial or economic type for which a
private person or corporate body could also have contracted. In the
case of operations which involve action by local authorities in the
exercise of functions reserved by public authority, the supplementary 
rules specified in the "public-law" outline contact (see 2.5) must be
borne in mind, in addition to the provisions set out below.


PARTIES

      Article 1 specifies the Parties (and whether the agreement is
open to other local authorities).

      Article 2 specifies the problems connected with general
contractual powers and, in particular, beneficiaries and terms and
conditions. It may also, where appropriate, specify the necessary
reservations regarding authorization by higher authorities, where this
affects the applicability of the contract.


OBJECT OF THE CONTRACT

      Article 3 specifies the object of the contract by reference to:

 -     specific matters; 
 -     geographical areas;
 -     corporate bodies (municipalities, national bodies with local
      powers, etc.);
 -     specific legal forms.

      Article 4 specifies the duration of the contract, the conditions
for renewal and any completion dates.


LEGAL REGIME AND FINANCIAL PROVISIONS

      Article 5 indicates the Place of signature and performance of the
contract and specifies the legal regime by which it is governed
(private international law) and the law which applies.

      Article 6 deals, where appropriate, with financial questions
(currency in which payment is to be made and the mode of price
adjustment in the case of long-term services) and insurance.


ARBITRATION

      Article 7 provides, if necessary, for a conciliation procedure
and provides for an arbitration procedure.

      In the event of arbitration the arbitration board shall be made
up as follows:

 -     each Party with opposing interests (Variant: the presidents of
       the administrative courts with jurisdiction over each of the
       parties) shall designate a member of the arbitration board and
       the Parties shall jointly appoint one or two independent members
       so that there may be an odd number of members.
 -     where there is an even number of members of the arbitration
       board and the votes are tied, the independent member shall have
       a casting vote.


ALTERATION AND TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT

      Article 8 specifies the rules to apply in the event of alteration
or termination of the contract.

      Article 9. The Parties shall inform the Secretary General of the
Council of Europe of the conclusion of this agreement and supply him
with the text.


2.5   OUTLINE CONTRACT FOR THE PROVISION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES
      BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN FRONTIER AREAS ("PUBLIC-LAW" TYPE)

      Introductory note:

      This type of contract is similar to that dealt with under 2.4
("private-law" contracts) in that it relates to specific purposes. This
type is more particularly concerned with concessions or contracts for
public services or public works (or services or works which are
regarded as "public" by one of the countries concerned), or the
provisions of contributory finance[6], from one authority to another
on the other side of the frontier. Such public concessions entail
special risks and responsibilities related to the public services
provided which require the inclusion in the contract of other
provisions in addition to those specified in the model "private-law"
contract.

      "Transfrontier" contracts of this type are not necessarily
permitted in all countries. Consequently, the possibility of such
arrangements and the conditions for their use would often first have
to be provided for in an inter-state agreement (see model agreement
1.4).

     The use of such a contract, which is simple enough to devise and
implement, could in some cases obviate the need for a joint agency of
the "Transfrontier  Syndicate of Local Authorities" type (see 2.6),
which raises other legal problems.


CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS

      Where the contract involves the establishment or administration
of public property, a public service or facility belonging to a local
authority in at least one of the countries, contractual guarantees must
be specified in accordance with the rules which apply in the country
or countries concerned.

      The contract will also, where necessary, make reference to the
following specific conditions:

1.    the regulations governing the establishment or operation of the
facility or service concerned (e.g. timetable, charges,      
conditions of use, etc.);

2.    special conditions governing the setting up of the facility or
service (e.g. permits required, procedure, etc.);

3.    the conditions of contract for the facility or service;

4.    the procedure for adjusting the contract for reasons of public
interest and resulting financial compensation;

5.    ensuing relations between users of the facility or service and
the operator (e.g. conditions of access, charges, etc.);

      In addition to these special requirements, the provisions
specified in the specimen "private-law" contract 2.4 will also apply.


2.6   OUTLINE AGREEMENT ON THE SETTING UP OF ORGANS OF TRANSFRONTIER
      CO-OPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES

      Introductory note:

      It is assumed that several local authorities may get together and
form a legally based organisation with a view to providing and
operating some public utility, service or facility body.

      The creation and functioning of such an association or syndicate
will mainly depend on the applicable legislation and the provisions of
any previous inter-state agreement authorising this form of
co-operation (see model agreement 1.5).

      There follows a list of the provisions that the articles of
association should include, insofar as they are not embodied in the
applicable legislation.

      The articles of association should specify, inter alia:

1.    the names of the founding members of the association and the
conditions on which new members may join;

2.    the name, headquarters, duration and legal status of the
association (with references to the law conferring legal status upon
it);

3.    the object of the association, the way in which it is to be
pursued and the resources at the association's disposal;

4.    the way in which the registered capital is constituted;

5.    the scope and limits of members' liabilities;

6.    the procedure for appointing and dismissing administrators or
managers of the association, as well as their powers;

7.    the association's relations with its members, third parties and
higher authorities, especially as regards the communication of budgets,
balance sheets and accounts;

8.    the people with responsibility for financial and technical
control over the activity of the association and the reports arising
out of such control;

9.    the conditions for altering the articles of association and for
the dissolution of the association;

10.   the rules applying to personnel;

11.   the rules applying to languages.


[1] As stated in Article 3, first paragraph, second sub-paragraph of
the Convention, the model and outline agreements, statutes and
contracts are intended for guidance only and have no treaty value.

[2] Paragraph 2 will not be included in draft agreements 1.3, 1.4 and
1.5.

[3] The figures given for the number of members of the Commission are
intended for guidance only and should be adapted to individual
situations, as indeed should all the provisions in this model
agreement. By giving figures the authors of the model agreements
intended to highlight the need for efficient commissions with
relatively few members. They also wanted to give an indication of the
ratio to be maintained between representatives of central authorities
on the one hand and of regional authorities on the other.

[4] This list is given merely for guidance and should be adapted to
each co-operation project.  It is not to be interpreted as modifying
the powers vested in territorial authorities by domestic law.  Both
central and regional authorities are, after all, represented on the
Commission.

[5] The coherence of this agreement remains the same whether or not
this paragraph is included.

[6] This arrangement might be particularly useful to frontier
authorities, e.g. in the case of pollution: one authority might offer
another contributory finance to enable it to carry out work within its
competence but of value to the first.
