CONVENTION ON COOPERATION FOR THE PROTECTION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF THE DANUBE RIVER, 1994

Preamble

The Contracting Parties,

Determined by the strong intention to intensify their water management coope-ration in the field of water protection and water use;

Concerned over the occurrence and threats of adverse effects, in the short or long term, of changes in conditions of watercourses within the Danube River Basin on the environment, economies and well-being of the Danubian States;

Emphasizing the urgent need for strengthened domestic and international measu-res to prevent, control and reduce significant adverse transboundary impact from the release of hazardous substances and of nutrients into the aquatic en-vironment within the Danube Basin with due attention also given to the Black Sea;

Commending the measures already taken on the domestic initiative of Danubian Countries and on the bilateral and multilateral level of their cooperation as well as the efforts already undertaken within the CSCE-process, by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and by the European Community to pro-mote the cooperation, on bilateral and multilateral levels, for the prevention and control of transboundary pollution, sustainable water management, rational use and conservation of water resources;

Referring in particular to the Convention on the protection and use of trans-boundary watercourses and international lakes of 17 March 1992 as well as the existing bi- and multilateral cooperation among Danubian States, which will be continued and duly taken into account by the cooperation of all Danubian Sta-tes, as well as pointing to the Convention on the protection of the Black Sea against pollution of 21 April 1992;

Striving at a lasting improvement and protection of Danube River and of the waters within its catchment area in particular in the transboundary context and at sustainable water management taking duly into account the interests of the Danubian States in the field of water use and at the same time contri-buting to the protection of the marine environment of the Black Sea;

Have agreed as follows:

PART I:
GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Article 1

DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of this Convention: 
(a) "Danubian States" mean sovereign States sharing a considerable part of the hydrological catchment area of the Danube River. As considerable part there is assumed a share exceeding 2000 km2 of the total hydrological catchment area.
(b) "Catchment area" of the Danube River means the hydrological river basin as far as it is shared by the Contracting Parties.
(c) "Transboundary impact" means any significant adverse effect on the rive-rine environment resulting from a change in the conditions of waters cau-sed by human activity and stretching out beyond an area under the juris-diction of a Contracting Party. Such changes may affect life and proper-ty, safety of facilities and the aquatic ecosystems concerned.
(d) "Hazardous substances" means substances which have toxic, cancerogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic or bioaccumulative effects, in particular those being persistent and having significant adverse impact on living orga-nisms.
(e) "Substances hazardous to water" means substances the hazard potential of which to water resources is extraordinarily high so that their handling requires special preventive and protective measures;
(f) "Point and non-point sources of water pollution" means the sources of pollutants and nutrients the input of which to waters is caused either by locally determined discharges (point source) or by diffuse effects being wide spread over the catchment areas (non-point sources); 
(g) "water balance" means the relationship characterising the natural water household of an entire river basin as to its components (precipitation, evaporation, surface and underground run-off). In addition a component of current man-made effects originating from water use and influencing water quantity is included. 
(h) "Connecting data" means summarised data derived from upstream water ba-lances as far as being relevant as an input necessary for the elaboration of downstream water balances and of a general water balance for the Danu-be River. To this extent connecting data cover the components of the wa-ter balance for all significant transboundary waters within the catchment area of the Danube River. Connecting data refer to cross sections of transboundary waters where they mark, cross or are located on boundaries between the Contracting Parties. 
(i) "International Commission" means the organisation established by Article 18 of this Convention. 

Article 2

Article 7

EMISSION LIMITATION; WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES AND CRITERIA
(1) The Contracting Parties taking into account the proposals from the International Commission shall set emission limits applicable to individual industrial sectors or industries in terms of pollution loads and concentrations and based in the beat possible way on low- and non-waste technologies at source. Where hazardous substances are discharged, the emission limits shall be based on the beat available techniques for the abatement at source and/or for waste water purification. For municipal waste water, emission limits shall be based on the application or at least biological or an equivalent level of treatment.
(2) Supplementary provisions for preventing or reducing the release of hazar-dous substances and nutrients shall be developed by the Contracting Parties for non-point sources, in particular where the main sources are originating from agriculture, taking into account the best environmental practice. 
(3) For the purpose of paragraphs 1 and 2 Annex II to this Convention contains a list of industrial sectors and industries as well as an additional list of hazardous substances and groups of substances, the discharge of which from point and non-point sources shall be prevented or considerably reduced. The updating of Annex II lies with the International Commission.
(4) The Contracting Parties in addition shall, where appropriate, define wa-ter quality objectives and apply water quality criteria for the purpose of preventing, controlling and reducing transboundary impact. General guidance for this is given in Annex III, which shall be applied and specified by the Contracting Parties both, at the domestic level and jointly, where appropriate.
(5) Aiming at an efficient limitation of the emissions in areas under their jurisdiction the Contracting Parties shall ensure necessary preconditions and implementation.
They shall ensure that:
(a) the domestic regulations for emission limitation and their level of stan-dards imposed are harmonised step by step with the emission limitation pursuant to this Convention;
(b) waste water discharges without exception are based on a permit imposed by the competent authorities in advance and for a limited period of validity;
(c) regulations and permits for prevention and control measures in case of new or modernised industrial facilities, in particular where hazardous substances are involved, are oriented on the best available techniques and are implemented with high priority;
(d) more stringent provisions than the standards - in individual case even prohibition - are imposed, where the character of the receiving water and of its ecosystem so requires in connection with paragraph 4;
(e) competent authorities surveille, that activities likely to cause trans-boundary impacts are carried out in compliance with the permits and pro-visions imposed;
(f) environmental impact assessment in line with supranational and interna-tional regulations or other procedures for evaluation and assessment of environmental effects are applied;
(g) when planning, licensing and implementing activities and measures as re-ferred to in Article 3, paragraph 2 and in Article 16, paragraph 2 the competent authorities take into account risks of accidents involving sub-stances hazardous to water by imposing preventive measures and by orde-ring rules of conduct for post accident response measures.

Article 8

EMISSION INVENTORIES, ACTION PROGRAMMES AND PROGRESS REVIEWS 
(1) The Contracting Parties shall undertake periodically inventories of the relevant point and non-point sources of pollution within the catchment area of Danube River including the prevention and abatement measures already taken for the respective discharges as well as on the actual efficiency of these measu-res, taking duly into account Article 5, paragraph 2, subpara a.
(2) Based on that the Contracting Parties shall in stages establish a list of further prevention and abatement measures to be taken step by step as far as this is necessary for reaching the objectives of this Convention.
(3) The inventory of emissions and the list of measures to be taken form the basis for developing joint action programmes to be developed by the Contrac-ting Parties taking into account priorities set in terms of urgency and effi-ciency. These action programmes in particular shall be aimed at the reduction of pollution loads and concentrations both from industrial and municipal point sources as well as from non-point sources. They shall inter alia contain the prevention and abatement measures including the timing and cost estimates.
(4) In addition the Contracting Parties shall monitor the progress made in the implementation of the joint action programmes by establishing periodical progress reviews. These reviews shall contain both, the protection measures implemented and the progress made as to the riverine conditions in the light of the actual assessment.

Article 9

MONITORING PROGRAMMES 
On the basis of their domestic activities, the Contracting Parties shall co-operate in the field of monitoring and assessment. 
(1) For this aim, they shall 
- harmonise or make comparable their monitoring and assessment methods as applied on their domestic levels, in particular in the field of river quality, emission control, flood forecast and water balance, with a view to achieving comparable results to be introduced into the joint monito-ring and assessment activities; 
- develop concerted or joint monitoring systems applying stationary or mo-bile measurement devices, communication and data processing facilities;
- elaborate and implement joint programmes for monitoring the riverine con-ditions in the Danube catchment area concerning both water quality and quantity, sediments and riverine ecosystems, as a basis for the assess-ment of transboundary impacts such as transboundary pollution and changes of the riverine regimes as well as of water balances, floods and ice-ha-zards;
- develop joint or harmonised methods for monitoring and assessment of wa-ste water discharges including processing, evaluation and documentation of data taking into account the branch-specific approach of emission li-mitation (Annex II, Part 1);
- elaborate inventories on relevant point sources including the pollutants discharged (emission inventories) and estimate the water pollution from non-point sources taking into account Annex II, Part 2; review these do-cuments according to the actual state.
(2) In particular they shall agree upon monitoring points, river quality cha-racteristics and pollution parameters regularly to be evaluated for the Danube River with a sufficient frequency taking into account the ecological and hy-drological character of the watercourse concerned as well as typical emissions of pollutants discharged within the respective catchment area.
(3) The Contracting Parties shall establish, on the basis of a harmonised methodology, domestic water balances, as well as the general water balance of the Danube River Basin. As an input for this purpose the Contracting Parties to the extent necessary shall provide connecting data which are sufficiently comparable through the application of the harmonised methodology. On the same data base water balances can also be compiled for the main tributaries of Da-nube River.
(4) They shall periodically assess the quality conditions of Danube River and the progress made by their measures taken aiming at the prevention, control and reduction of transboundary impacts. The results will be presented to the public by appropriate publications.

Part 1
BEST AVAILABLE TECHNIQUES 
1. The use of the best available techniques shall emphasize the use of non-waste technology, if available.
2. The term "best available techniques" means the latest stage of development (state of the art) of processes, of facilities or of methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of a particular measure for limiting discharges, emissions and waste. In determining whether a set of processes, facilities and methods of operation constitute the best available techniques in general or individual cases, special consideration shall be given to:
(a) comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have re-cently been successfully tried out; 
(b) technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and under-standing; 
(c) the economic feasibility of such techniques; 
(d) time limits for installation in both new and existing plants; 
(e) the nature and volume of the discharges and emissions concerned.
3. It therefore follows that what is "best available techniques" for a particular process will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding. 
4. If the reduction of discharges and emissions resulting from the use of best available techniques does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied.
5. The term "Techniques" includes both the technology used and the way the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and dismantled.
Part 2
BEST ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICE
1. Beat environmental practice means the application of the most appropriate combination of sectoral environmental control strategies and measures.
2. In determining what combination of measures constitute best environmental practice, in general or individual cases, particular consideration should be given to:
- the precautionary principle; 
- the environmental hazard of the product and its production, use and ulti-mate disposal (principle of responsibility); 
- the substitution by less polluting activities or substances and saving resources including energy (principle of minimising); 
- the scale of use; 
- the potential environmental benefit or penalty of substitute materials or activities; 
- advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding; 
- time limits for implementation; 
- social and economic implication. 
3. It therefore follows that best environmental practice for a particular source of impacts will change with time in the light of technological advan-ces, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.
4. If the reduction of impacts resulting from the use of best environmental practice does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional mea-sures have to be applied and best environmental practice redefined.
