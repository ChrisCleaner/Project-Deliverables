European Landscape Convention


Preamble

The member States of the Council of Europe signatory hereto,

Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity 
between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and 
principles which are their common heritage, and that this aim is pursued in 
particular through agreements in the economic and social fields;

Concerned to achieve sustainable development based on a balanced and harmonious 
relationship between social needs, economic activity and the environment;

Noting that the landscape has an important public interest role in the cultural, 
ecological, environmental and social fields, and constitutes a resource 
favourable to economic activity and whose protection, management and planning 
can contribute to job creation;

Aware that the landscape contributes to the formation of local cultures and that 
it is a basic component of the European natural and cultural heritage, 
contributing to human well-being and consolidation of the European identity;

Acknowledging that the landscape is an important part of the quality of life for 
people everywhere: in urban areas and in the countryside, in degraded areas as 
well as in areas of high quality, in areas recognised as being of outstanding 
beauty as well as everyday areas;

Noting that developments in agriculture, forestry, industrial and mineral 
production techniques and in regional planning, town planning, transport, 
infrastructure, tourism and recreation and, at a more general level, changes in 
the world economy are in many cases accelerating the transformation of 
landscapes;

Wishing to respond to the public’s wish to enjoy high quality landscapes and to 
play an active part in the development of landscapes;

Believing that the landscape is a key element of individual and social 
well-being and that its protection, management and planning entail rights and 
responsibilities for everyone;

Having regard to the legal texts existing at international level in the field of 
protection and management of the natural and cultural heritage, regional and 
spatial planning, local self-government and transfrontier co-operation, in 
particular the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural 

Habitats (Bern, 19 September 1979), the Convention for the Protection of the 
Architectural Heritage of Europe (Granada, 3 October 1985), the European 
Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (revised) (Valletta, 
16 January 1992), the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation 
between Territorial Communities or Authorities (Madrid, 21 May 1980) and its 
additional protocols, the European Charter of Local Self-government (Strasbourg, 
15 October 1985), the Convention on Biological Diversity (Rio, 5 June 1992), the 
Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage 
(Paris, 16 November 1972), and the Convention on Access to Information, Public 
Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice on Environmental Matters 
(Aarhus, 25 June 1998);

Acknowledging that the quality and diversity of European landscapes constitute a 
common resource, and that it is important to co-operate towards its protection, 
management and planning;

Wishing to provide a new instrument devoted exclusively to the protection, 
management and planning of all landscapes in Europe,

Have agreed as follows:
