<blockquote><b>AUSTRALIA AND INDONESIA,</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Recognizing the desirability of having boundaries of political
and physical permanence between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering the desirability of demarcating more precisely
in certain respects the land boundaries on the island of New Guinea (Irian)
as described in Articles I, II, III and IV of the Convention between Great
Britain and the Netherlands dated the sixteenth day of May One thousand
eight hundred and ninety-five,</blockquote>

of the land boundaries on the island of New Guinea (Irian),</blockquote>

<blockquote>Noting in particular, with appreciation, the work of the Joint
Survey by the Australian and Indonesian Survey Authorities (in this Agreement
called "the joint Survey") in surveying boundaries on the island of New
Guinea (Irian) as described in their final report dated the twelfth day
of February One thousand nine hundred and seventy,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Recalling that in the Agreement between the Australian and
Indonesian Governments dated the eighteenth day of May One thousand nine
hundred and seventy-one (in this Agreement called "the 1971 Seabed Agreement")
the two Governments left for further discussion the question of the seabed
boundary line between the point of Latitude 9&deg;24' 30" South, Longitude
140&deg; 49' 30" East (Point B 1 shown on the chart annexed to this Agreement
and on chart "A" annexed to the 1971 Seabed Agreement) and the point at
which the land boundary between the Territory of Papua and West Irian meets
the southern coast of the island of New Guinea (Irian),</blockquote>

<blockquote>HAVE AGREED as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 1</blockquote>

<blockquote>The boundary between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia on the
island of New Guinea (Irian) shall be more precisely demarcated as follows;</blockquote>

<dir>
<blockquote><i>(a)</i> In the north the boundary is the meridian of Longitude
141 East extending southwards from the point of the intersection of the
meridian with the mean low water line on the northern coast, located at
Latitude 2&deg;35'37" South, to the point of its most northerly intersection
with the waterway ("thalweg") of the Fly River and that meridian shall
be deemed to lie along the geodesic lines successively linking the markers
MM<sub>1</sub>, MM<sub>2</sub>, MM<sub>3</sub>, MM<sub>4</sub>, MM<sub>5</sub>,
MM<sub>6</sub>, MM<sub>7</sub>, MM<sub>8</sub>, MM<sub>9</sub> and MM<sub>10</sub>
established by the Joint Survey and indicated on the chart annexed to this
Agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>(b)</i> From the point of the most northerly intersection
of the meridian of Longitude 141&deg; East with the waterway ("thalweg")
of the Fly River (at present located at Latitude 6&deg; 19' 24" South)
the boundary lies along that waterway to the point of its most southerly
intersection with the meridian of Longitude 141&deg; 01' 10" East (at present
located at Latitude 6&deg;5 3' 33" South).</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>(c)</i> From the last- mentioned point the boundary is the
meridian of Longitude 141&deg; 01' 10" East extending southwards to the
point of Latitude 9&deg; 08' 08" South (Point B3 shown on the chart annexed
to this Agreement) and that meridian shall be deemed to lie along the geodesic
lines successively linking the markers MM<sub>11</sub>, MM<sub><font face="b">12</font></sub>,
MM<sub><font face="b">13</font></sub> and MM<sub>14</sub> established by
the Joint Survey and indicated on the chart annexed to this Agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 2</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Governments of Australia and Indonesia, as soon as practicable
after the entry into force of this Agreement and at a time to be agreed
upon by them, shall arrange for aerial or satellite photography of that
part of the Fly River referred to in Article l(b), of this Agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thereafter, such photography of that part of the Fly River
shall be arranged periodically at intervals to be agreed upon.</blockquote>

<blockquote ALIGN="CENTER"><b>ARTICLE 3</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Immediately off the southern coast of the island of New Guinea
(Irian), the boundary between the area of seabed that is adjacent to and
appertains to Papua New Guinea and the area that is adjacent to and appertains
to Indonesia shall be the straight lines shown on the chart annexed to
this Agreement commencing at the point of Latitude 9&deg; 24' 30" South,
Longitude 140&deg; 49' 30" East (Point B1) and thence connecting the points
specified hereunder in the sequence so specified:</blockquote>

<dir>
<blockquote>B2. The point of Latitude 9&deg; 23' South, Longitude 140&deg;
52' East</blockquote>

<blockquote>B3. The point of Latitude 9&deg; 08' 08" South, Longitude 141&deg;
01' 10" East referred to in Article 1<i>(c)</i> of this Agreement.</blockquote>
</dir>

<blockquote ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 4</blockquote>

<blockquote>The point B3 referred to in Articles 1<i>(c)</i> and 3 of this
Agreement is the present location of the point of intersection of the meridian
of Longitude 141&deg; 01' 10" East with the mean low water line on the
southern coast of the island of New Guinea (Irian). If the point B3 ceases
to be the point of such intersection the land boundary referred to in Article
1<i>(c)</i> and the seabed boundary referred to in Article 3 shall meet
and terminate at the point at which the straight lines connecting the points
MM<sub>14</sub>, B3 and B2 shown on the chart annexed to this Agreement
intersect the mean low water line on the southern coast.</blockquote>

<blockquote ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 5</blockquote>

<blockquote>For the purpose of this Agreement "seabed" includes the subsoil
thereof, except where the context otherwise requires.</blockquote>

<blockquote ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 6</blockquote>

<blockquote>If any single accumulation of liquid hydrocarbons or natural
gas, or if any other mineral deposit beneath the seabed, extends across
any of the seabed boundary lines that are referred to in this Agreement,
and the part of such accumulation or deposit that is situated on one side
of the line is recoverable in fluid form wholly or in part from the other
side of the line, the Governments of Australia and Indonesia will seek
to reach agreement on the manner in which the accumulation or deposit shall
be most effectively exploited and on the equitable sharing of the benefits
arising from such exploitation.</blockquote>

<blockquote ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 7</blockquote>

<blockquote>Off the northern and southern coasts of the island of New Guinea
(Irian) the lateral boundaries of the respective territorial seas and exclusive
fishing zones shall so far as they extend coincide with the seabed boundary
lines referred to in Article 3 of this Agreement and in Article 4 of the
1971 Seabed Agreement.</blockquote>
