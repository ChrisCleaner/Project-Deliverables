PROTOCOL TO AMEND THE 1963 VIENNA CONVENTION ON CIVIL LIABILITY FOR NUCLEAR
DAMAGE


THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS PROTOCOL,

CONSIDERING that it is desirable to amend the Vienna Convention on Civil 
Liability for Nuclear Damage of 21 May 1963, to provide for broader scope, 
increased amount of liability of the operator of a nuclear installation and 
enhanced means for securing adequate and equitable compensation,

HAVE AGREED as follows,

Article 1

The Convention which the provisions of this Protocol amend is the Vienna 
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage of 21 May 1963, hereinafter 
referred to as the "1963 Vienna Convention".

Article 2

Article I of the 1963 Vienna Convention is amended as follows:
  Paragraph 1(j) is amended as follows: 
    the word "and" is deleted at the end of sub-paragraph (ii) and is inserted 
    at the end of sub-paragraph (iii). 

    a new sub-paragraph (iv) is added as follows: 

    (iv)   such other installations in which there are nuclear fuel or 
    radioactive products or waste as the Board of Governors of the International 
    Atomic Energy Agency shall from time to time determine; 



  Paragraph 1(k) is replaced by the following text: 

  (k)  "Nuclear Damage" means -

    loss of life or personal injury; 

    loss of or damage to property;

    and each of the following to the extent determined by the law of the 
    competent court; 

    economic loss arising from loss or damage referred to in sub-paragraph (i) 
    or (ii), insofar as not included in those sub-paragraphs, if incurred by a 
    person entitled to claim in respect of such loss or damage; 

    the costs of measures of reinstatement of impaired environment, unless such 
    impairment is insignificant, if such measures are actually taken or to be 
    taken, and insofar as not included in sub-paragraph (ii); 

    loss of income deriving from an economic interest in any use or enjoyment of 
    the environment, incurred as a result of a significant impairment of that 
    environment, and insofar as not included in sub-paragraph (ii); 

    the costs of preventive measures, and further loss or damage caused by such 
    measures; 

    any other economic loss, other than any caused by the impairment of the 
    environment, if permitted by the general law on civil liability of the 
    competent court, 

  in the case of subparagraphs (i) to (v) and (vii) above, to the extent that 
  the loss or damage arises out of or results from ionizing radiation emitted by 
  any source of radiation inside a nuclear installation, or emitted from nuclear 
  fuel or radioactive products or waste in, or of nuclear material coming from, 
  originating in, or sent to, a nuclear installation, whether so arising from 
  the radioactive properties of such matter, or from a combination of 
  radioactive properties with toxic, explosive or other hazardous properties of 
  such matter. 

  Paragraph 1(l) is replaced by the following text: 

  (l)   "Nuclear incident" means any occurrence or series of occurrences having 
  the same origin which causes nuclear damage or, but only with respect to 
  preventive measures, creates a grave and imminent threat of causing such 
  damage. 

  After paragraph 1(l) four new paragraphs 1(m), 1(n), 1(o) and 1(p) are added 
  as follows: 

  (m)   ""Measures of reinstatement" means any reasonable measures which have 
  been approved by the competent authorities of the State where the measures 
  were taken, and which aim to reinstate or restore damaged or destroyed 
  components of the environment, or to introduce, where reasonable, the 
  equivalent of these components into the environment. The law of the State 
  where the damage is suffered shall determine who is entitled to take such 
  measures. 

  (n)   ""Preventive measures" means any reasonable measures taken by any person 
  after a nuclear incident has occurred to prevent or minimize damage referred 
  to in sub-paragraphs (k)(i) to (v) or (vii), subject to any approval of the 
  competent authorities required by the law of the State where the measures were 
  taken. 

  (o)   ""Reasonable measures" means measures which are found under the law of 
  the competent court to be appropriate and proportionate having regard to all 
  the circumstances, for example - 

    the nature and extent of the damage incurred or, in the case of preventive 
    measures, the nature and extent of the risk of such damage; 

    the extent to which, at the time they are taken, such measures are likely to 
    be effective; and 

    relevant scientific and technical expertise. 

  (p)   "Special Drawing Right", hereinafter referred to as SDR, means the unit 
  of account defined by the International Monetary Fund and used by it for its 
  own operations and transactions. 

  Paragraph 2 is replaced by the following text: 

    2.   An Installation State may, if the small extent of the risks involved so 
    warrants, exclude any nuclear installation or small quantities of nuclear 
    material from the application of this Convention, provided that- 

      with respect to nuclear installations, criteria for such exclusion have 
      been established by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic 
      Energy Agency and any exclusion by an Installation State satisfies such 
      criteria; and 

      with respect to small quantities of nuclear material, maximum limits for 
      the exclusion of such quantities have been established by the Board of 
      Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency and any exclusion by 
      an Installation State is within such established limits. 

    The criteria for the exclusion of nuclear installations and the maximum 
    limits for the exclusion of small quantities of nuclear material shall be 
    reviewed periodically by the Board of Governors. 

Article 3

After Article I of the 1963 Vienna Convention two new Articles I A and I B are 
added as follows:
Article I A
  This Convention shall apply to nuclear damage wherever suffered. 

  However, the legislation of the Installation State may exclude from the 
  application of this Convention damage suffered - 

    in the territory of a non-Contracting State; or 

    in any maritime zones established by a non-Contracting State in accordance 
    with the international law of the sea. 

  An exclusion pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article may apply only in respect 
  of a non-Contracting State which at the time of the incident - 

    has a nuclear installation in its territory or in any maritime zones 
    established by it in accordance with the international law of the sea; and 

    does not afford equivalent reciprocal benefits. 

  Any exclusion pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article shall not affect the 
  rights referred to in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 2 of Article IX and any 
  exclusion pursuant to paragraph 2(b) of this Article shall not extend to 
  damage on board or to a ship or an aircraft. 
Article I B
This Convention shall not apply to nuclear installations used for non-peaceful 
purposes.

Article 4

Article II of the 1963 Vienna Convention is amended as follows:
  At the end of paragraph 3(a) the following text is added: 

  The Installation State may limit the amount of public funds made available per 
  incident to the difference, if any, between the amounts hereby established and 
  the amount established pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article V. 

  At the end of paragraph 4 the following text is added: 
  The Installation State may limit the amount of public funds made available as 
  provided for in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 3 of this Article. 

  Paragraph 6 is replaced by the following text: 
  6.   No person shall be liable for any loss or damage which is not nuclear 
  damage pursuant to sub-paragraph (k) of paragraph 1 of Article I but which 
  could have been determined as such pursuant to the provisions of that 
  sub-paragraph.

Article 5

After the first sentence in Article III of the 1963 Vienna Convention the 
following text is added:
However, the Installation State may exclude this obligation in relation to 
carriage which takes place wholly within its own territory.

Article 6

Article IV of the 1963 Vienna Convention is amended as follows:
  Paragraph 3 is replaced by the following text: 

  3.   No liability under this Convention shall attach to an operator if he 
  proves that the nuclear damage is directly due to an act of armed conflict, 
  hostilities, civil war or insurrection. 
  Paragraph 5 is replaced by the following text: 
  5.   The operator shall not be liable under this Convention for nuclear damage 
  - 
    to the nuclear installation itself and any other nuclear installation, 
    including a nuclear installation under construction, on the site where that 
    installation is located; and 

    to any property on that same site which is used or to be used in connection 
    with any such installation. 
  Paragraph 6 is replaced by the following text: 

  6.   Compensation for damage caused to the means of transport upon which the 
  nuclear material involved was at the time of the nuclear incident shall not 
  have the effect of reducing the liability of the operator in respect of other 
  damage to an amount less than either 150 million SDRs, or any higher amount 
  established by the legislation of a Contracting Party, or an amount 
  established pursuant to sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 1 of Article V. 

  Paragraph 7 is replaced by the following text: 

  7.   Nothing in this Convention shall affect the liability of any individual 
  for nuclear damage for which the operator, by virtue of paragraph 3 or 5 of 
  this Article, is not liable under this Convention and which that individual 
  caused by an act or omission done with intent to cause damage. 

Article 7

  The text of Article V of the 1963 Vienna Convention is replaced by the 
  following text: 

    The liability of the operator may be limited by the Installation State for 
    any one nuclear incident, either - 

      to not less than 300 million SDRs; or 

      to not less than 150 million SDRs provided that in excess of that amount 
      and up to at least 300 million SDRs public funds shall be made available 
      by that State to compensate nuclear damage; or 

      for a maximum of 15 years from the date of entry into force of this 
      Protocol, to a transitional amount of not less than 100 million SDRs in 
      respect of a nuclear incident occurring within that period. An amount 
      lower than 100 million SDRs may be established, provided that public funds 
      shall be made available by that State to compensate nuclear damage between 
      that lesser amount and 100 million SDRs. 

    Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the Installation State, having 
    regard to the nature of the nuclear installation or the nuclear substances 
    involved and to the likely consequences of an incident originating 
    therefrom, may establish a lower amount of liability of the operator, 
    provided that in no event shall any amount so established be less than 5 
    million SDRs, and provided that the Installation State ensures that public 
    funds shall be made available up to the amount established pursuant to 
    paragraph 1. 

    The amounts established by the Installation State of the liable operator in 
    accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article and paragraph 6 of 
    Article IV shall apply wherever the nuclear incident occurs. 

  After Article V, four new Articles V A, V B, V C and V D are added as follows: 

Article V A
  Interest and costs awarded by a court in actions for compensation of nuclear 
  damage shall be payable in addition to the amounts referred to in Article V. 

  The amounts mentioned in Article V and paragraph 6 of Article IV may be 
  converted into national currency in round figures. 
Article V B
Each Contracting Party shall ensure that persons suffering damage may enforce 
their rights to compensation without having to bring separate proceedings 
according to the origin of the funds provided for such compensation.
Article V C
  If the courts having jurisdiction are those of a Contracting Party other than 
  the Installation State, the public funds required under sub-paragraphs (b) and 
  (c) of paragraph 1 of Article V and under paragraph 1 of Article VII, as well 
  as interest and costs awarded by a court, may be made available by the 
  first-named Contracting Party. The Installation State shall reimburse to the 
  other Contracting Party any such sums paid. These two Contracting Parties 
  shall agree on the procedure for reimbursement. 

  If the courts having jurisdiction are those of a Contracting Party other than 
  the Installation State, the Contracting Party whose courts have jurisdiction 
  shall take all measures necessary to enable the Installation State to 
  intervene in proceedings and to participate in any settlement concerning 
  compensation. 
Article V D
  A meeting of the Contracting Parties shall be convened by the Director General 
  of the International Atomic Energy Agency to amend the limits of liability 
  referred to in Article V if one-third of the Contracting Parties express a 
  desire to that effect. 

  Amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the Contracting 
  Parties present and voting, provided that at least one-half of the Contracting 
  Parties shall be present at the time of the voting. 

  When acting on a proposal to amend the limits, the meeting of the Contracting 
  Parties shall take into account, inter alia, the risk of damage resulting from 
  a nuclear incident, changes in the monetary values, and the capacity of the 
  insurance market. 

    Any amendment adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article shall 
    be notified by the Director General of the IAEA to all Contracting Parties 
    for acceptance. The amendment shall be considered accepted at the end of a 
    period of 18 months after it has been notified provided that at least 
    one-third of the Contracting Parties at the time of the adoption of the 
    amendment by the meeting have communicated to the Director General of the 
    IAEA that they accept the amendment. An amendment accepted in accordance 
    with this paragraph shall enter into force 12 months after its acceptance 
    for those Contracting Parties which have accepted it. 

    If, within a period of 18 months from the date of notification for 
    acceptance, an amendment has not been accepted in accordance with 
    sub-paragraph (a), the amendment shall be considered rejected. 

  For each Contracting Party accepting an amendment after it has been accepted 
  but not entered into force or after its entry into force in accordance with 
  paragraph 4 of this Article, the amendment shall enter into force 12 months 
  after its acceptance by that Contracting Party. 

  A State which becomes a Party to this Convention after the entry into force of 
  an amendment in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article shall, failing an 
  expression of a different intention by that State - 

    be considered as a Party to this Convention as so amended; and 

    be considered as a Party to the unamended Convention in relation to any 
    State Party not bound by the amendment. 

Article 8

Article VI of the 1963 Vienna Convention is amended as follows:
  Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following text: 

      Rights of compensation under this Convention shall be extinguished if an 
      action is not brought within - 

        with respect to loss of life and personal injury, thirty years from the 
        date of the nuclear incident; 

        with respect to other damage, ten years from the date of the nuclear 
        incident. 

      If, however, under the law of the Installation State, the liability of the 
      operator is covered by insurance or other financial security including 
      State funds for a longer period, the law of the competent court may 
      provide that rights of compensation against the operator shall only be 
      extinguished after such a longer period which shall not exceed the period 
      for which his liability is so covered under the law of the Installation 
      State. 

      Actions for compensation with respect to loss of life and personal injury 
      or, pursuant to an extension under sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph 
      with respect to other damage, which are brought after a period of ten 
      years from the date of the nuclear incident shall in no case affect the 
      rights of compensation under this Convention of any person who has brought 
      an action against the operator before the expiry of that period. 

  Paragraph 2 is deleted. 

  Paragraph 3 is replaced by the following text: 

  3.   Rights of compensation under the Convention shall be subject to 
  prescription or extinction, as provided by the law of the competent court, if 
  an action is not brought within three years from the date on which the person 
  suffering damage had knowledge or ought reasonably to have had knowledge of 
  the damage and of the operator liable for the damage, provided that the 
  periods established pursuant to sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of 
  this Article shall not be exceeded. 

Article 9

Article VII is amended as follows:
  In paragraph 1, the following two sentences are added at the end of the 
  paragraph and the paragraph so amended becomes sub-paragraph (a) of that 
  paragraph: 

  Where the liability of the operator is unlimited, the Installation State may 
  establish a limit of the financial security of the operator liable, provided 
  that such limit is not lower than 300 million SDRs. The Installation State 
  shall ensure the payment of claims for compensation for nuclear damage which 
  have been established against the operator to the extent that the yield of the 
  financial security is inadequate to satisfy such claims, but not in excess of 
  the amount of the financial security to be provided under this paragraph. 

  A new sub-paragraph (b) is added to paragraph 1 as follows: 

  (b)   Notwithstanding sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, where the liability 
  of the operator is unlimited, the Installation State, having regard to the 
  nature of the nuclear installation or the nuclear substances involved and to 
  the likely consequences of an incident originating therefrom, may establish a 
  lower amount of financial security of the operator, provided that in no event 
  shall any amount so established be less than 5 million SDRs, and provided that 
  the Installation State ensures the payment of claims for compensation for 
  nuclear damage which have been established against the operator by providing 
  necessary funds to the extent that the yield of insurance or other financial 
  security is inadequate to satisfy such claims, and up to the limit provided 
  pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph. 

  In paragraph 3, the words "or sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 of 
  Article V" are inserted after the words "of this Article". 

Article 10

  The text of Article VIII becomes paragraph 1 of that Article. 

  A new paragraph 2 is added as follows: 
  2.   Subject to application of the rule of sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 1 of 
  Article VI, where in respect of claims brought against the operator the damage 
  to be compensated under this Convention exceeds, or is likely to exceed, the 
  maximum amount made available pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article V, priority 
  in the distribution of the compensation shall be given to claims in respect of 
  loss of life or personal injury. 

Article 11

In Article X of the 1963 Vienna Convention, a new sentence is added at the end 
of the Article as follows: 
The right of recourse provided for under this Article may also be extended to

Article XI of the 1963 Vienna Convention is amended as follows:
  A new paragraph 1bis is added as follows: 

  1bis.  Where a nuclear incident occurs within the area of the exclusive 
  economic zone of a Contracting Party or, if such a zone has not been 
  established, in an area not exceeding the limits of an exclusive economic 
  zone, were one to be established, jurisdiction over actions concerning nuclear 
  damage from that nuclear incident shall, for the purposes of this Convention, 
  lie only with the courts of that Party. The preceding sentence shall apply if 
  that Contracting Party has notified the Depositary of such area prior to the 
  nuclear incident. Nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted as permitting 
  the exercise of jurisdiction in a manner which is contrary to the 
  international law of the sea, including the United Nations Convention on the 
  Law of the Sea. 

  Paragraph 2 is replaced by the following text: 
  2.   Where a nuclear incident does not occur within the territory of any 
  Contracting Party, or within an area notified pursuant to paragraph 1bis, or 
  where the place of the nuclear incident cannot be determined with certainty, 
  jurisdiction over such actions shall lie with the courts of the Installation 
  State of the operator liable. 

  In paragraph 3, first line, and in sub-paragraph (b), after the figure "1", 
  insert ", 1bis".

Article XI A
The Contracting Party whose courts have jurisdiction shall ensure that in 
relation to actions for compensation of nuclear damage -
  any State may bring an action on behalf of persons who have suffered nuclear 
  damage, who are nationals of that State or have their domicile or residence in 
  its territory, and who have consented thereto; and 

  any person may bring an action to enforce rights under this Convention 
  acquired by subrogation or assignment. 

Article 14

The text of Article XII of the 1963 Vienna Convention is replaced by the 
following text:
Article XII
  A judgment that is no longer subject to ordinary forms of review entered by a 
  court of a Contracting Party having jurisdiction shall be recognized, except - 

    where the judgment was obtained by fraud; 

    where the party against whom the judgment was pronounced was not given a 
    fair opportunity to present his case; or 

    where the judgment is contrary to the public policy of the Contracting Party 
    within the territory of which recognition is sought, or is not in accord 
    with fundamental standards of justice. 

  A judgment which is recognized under paragraph 1 of this Article shall, upon 
  being presented for enforcement in accordance with the formalities required by 
  the law of the Contracting Party where enforcement is sought, be enforceable

  Installation State may derogate from the provisions of this Convention with 
  respect to nuclear damage suffered in the territory, or in any maritime zone 
  established in accordance with the international law of the sea, of another 
  State which at the time of the incident, has a nuclear installation in such 
  territory, to the extent that it does not afford reciprocal benefits of an 
  equivalent amount. 

Article 16

The text of Article XVIII of the 1963 Vienna Convention is replaced by the 
following text:
This Convention shall not affect the rights and obligations of a Contracting 
Party under the general rules of public international law.

Article 17

After Article XX of the 1963 Vienna Convention a new Article XX A is added as 
follows:
Article XX A
  In the event of a dispute between Contracting Parties concerning the 
  interpretation or application of this Convention, the parties to the dispute

  by any other peaceful means of settling disputes acceptable to them. 

  If a dispute of this character referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article 
  cannot be settled within six months from the request for consultation pursuant 
  to paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall, at the request of any party to such

  Justice for decision. Where a dispute is submitted to arbitration, if, within 
  six months from the date of the request, the parties to the dispute are unable 
  to agree on the organization of the arbitration, a party may request the 
  President of the International Court of Justice or the Secretary-General of

  requests by the parties to the dispute, the request to the Secretary-General 
  of the United Nations shall have priority. 

  When ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to this Convention, a State 
  may declare that it does not consider itself bound by either or both of the 
  dispute settlement procedures provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article. The 
  other Contracting Parties shall not be bound by a dispute settlement procedure 
  provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article with respect to a Contracting 
  Party for which such a declaration is in force. 

  A Contracting Party which has made a declaration in accordance with paragraph 
  3 of this Article may at any time withdraw it by notification to the 
  depositary. 

Article 18

  Articles XX to XXV, paragraphs 2, 3 and paragraph number "1." of Article XXVI,

  expression of a different intention by that State at the time of deposit of an 
  instrument referred to in Article 20 shall be bound by the provisions of the 
  1963 Vienna Convention in relation to States which are only Parties thereto. 

  Nothing in this Protocol shall affect the obligations of a State which is a 
  Party both to the 1963 Vienna Convention and to this Protocol with respect to

Article 22

  Any Contracting Party may denounce this Protocol by written notification to 
  the depositary.
