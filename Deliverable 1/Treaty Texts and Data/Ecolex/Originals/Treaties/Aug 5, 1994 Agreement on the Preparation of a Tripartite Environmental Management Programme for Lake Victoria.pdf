AGREEMENT ON THE PREPARATION OF A TRIPARTITE ENVIRONMENTAL
MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME FOR LAKE VICTORIA

Adopted at Arusha on 5 August 1994


      The Contracting Parties

      The Governments of the Republic of Kenya, the United Republic
of Tanzania and the Republic of Uganda, referred to below as the
Parties;

      Recognizing the efforts made by the three States to strengthen
regional co-operation in the spirit of the Agreement for the
Establishment of a Permanent Tripartite Commission for the Co-
operation among them signed in Arusha on 30th November 1993;

      Aware of the environmental importance of Lake Victoria and its
significance to the sustainable development of the three riparian
countries;

      Concerned that the present level of exploitation of the
fisheries resources of Lake Victoria may be close to the limits of
the sustainable yield of the lake fishery;

      Further concerned that increased agricultural and urban run-
off, discharge of domestic and industrial waste into Lake Victoria
adversely affects the ecological system of the Lake;

      Recognizing that the conversion of wetland areas around Lake
Victoria for agricultural and/or other uses may have a detrimental
effect on the lake ecosystem;

      Noting that significant changes have occurred as regards fish
stocks within Lake Victoria with some of the indigenous species
facing depletion;

      Agreeing that regional co-operation is an essential component
of the environmental management of the Lake, and being in the
process of establishing the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization to
jointly manage the fishery resources of the Lake;

      Recognizing that poverty is both a cause and a consequence of
environmental degradation and must therefore be addressed adequately
in order to enhance equitable and sustainable development among
riparian communities;

      Desirous to maximize the benefits accruing to the riparian
countries from integrated and sustainable utilization of Lake
Victoria resources and the conservation of a global natural
heritage;

      Recognizing that integrated management of the various
resources which constitute the lake environment, is essential;

      Accepting that the environmental management of Lake Victoria
will require a sustained long-term effort based on a comprehensive
programme addressing the various problems; and to this end requires
national capacity building by using and strengthening existing
institutions to conduct on a sustainable basis ongoing and
additional functions under a regional programme.

      Have agreed as follows
