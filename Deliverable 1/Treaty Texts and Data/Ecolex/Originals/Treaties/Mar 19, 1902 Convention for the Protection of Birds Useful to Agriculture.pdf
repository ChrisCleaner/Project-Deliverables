In case the high contracting parties should not be in a position to enforce the prohibitions included in the preceding clause at once and in their entirety, they may mitigate the severity of the said prohibitions as required, but engage to restrict the use of methods, weapons and instruments of capture and killing in such a manner that the protective measures contained in Art. 3 may be carried into effect gradatim.
