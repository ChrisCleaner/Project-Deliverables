CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND 
COASTAL AREA OF THE SOUTH-EAST PACIFIC

Lima, 12 November 1981


The High Contracting Parties,

Conscious of the need to protect and preserve the marine 
environment and coastal area of the South-East Pacific against 
all types and sources of pollution,

Convinced of the economic, social and cultural values of the 
South-East Pacific as a means of linking the countries of the 
region,

Considering that the various international agreements concerning 
marine pollution which are in force, despite all the progress 
achieved, do not cover all types and sources of pollution and do 
not completely satisfy the needs and requirements of the 
countries of the region,

Recognizing the desirability of co-operating at the regional 
level, either directly or with the assistance of the Permanent 
Commission of the South Pacific or other competent international 
organizations, in protecting and preserving the aforesaid marine 
environment and coastal area,

Have agreed on the following:


Article 1

GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE

The sphere of application of this Convention shall be the sea 
area and the coastal zone of the South-East Pacific within the 
200-mile maritime area of sovereignty and jurisdiction of the 
High Contracting Parties and, beyond that area, the high seas up 
to a distance within which pollution of the high seas may affect 
that area.


Article 2
