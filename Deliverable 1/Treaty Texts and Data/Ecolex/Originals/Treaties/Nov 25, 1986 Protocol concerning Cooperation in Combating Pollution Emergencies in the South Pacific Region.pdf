PROTOCOL CONCERNING CO-OPERATION IN COMBATING POLLUTION 
EMERGENCIES IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC REGION

Adopted at Noumea on 25 November 1986


The Parties to this Protocol,

Being Parties to the Convention for the Protection of the 
Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region 
adopted in Noumea, New Caledonia on the twenty-fourth day of 
November in the year one thousand nine hundred and eighty-six;

Conscious that the exploration, development and use of offshore 
and near shore minerals and the use of hazardous substances, as 
well as related vessel traffic, pose the threat of significant 
pollution emergencies in the South Pacific Region;

Aware that the islands of the region are particularly vulnerable 
to damage resulting from significant pollution due to the 
sensitivity of their ecosystems and their economic reliance on 
the continuous utilization of their coastal areas;

Recognizing that in the event of a pollution emergency or threat 
thereof, prompt and effective action should be taken initially at 
the national level to organise and co-ordinate prevention, 
mitigation and cleanup activities;

Recognizing further the importance of rational preparation and 
mutual co-operation and assistance in responding effectively to 
pollution emergencies or the threat thereof;

Determined to avert ecological damage to the marine environment 
and coastal areas of the South Pacific Region through the 
adoption of national contingency plans to be co-ordinated with 
appropriate bilateral and sub-regional contingency plans;

Have agreed as follows:
