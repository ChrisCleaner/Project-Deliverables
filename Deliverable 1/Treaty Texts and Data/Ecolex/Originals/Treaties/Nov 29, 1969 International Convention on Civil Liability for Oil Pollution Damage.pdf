INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON CIVIL LIABILITY FOR OIL POLLUTION DAMAGE

Adopted at Brussels on 29 November 1969


      The States Parties to the present Convention,

      Conscious of the dangers of pollution posed by the worldwide
maritime carriage of oil in bulk,

      Convinced of the need to ensure that adequate compensation is
available to persons who suffer damage caused by pollution resulting
from the escape or discharge of oil from ships,

      Desiring to adopt uniform international rules and procedures
for determining questions of liability and providing adequate
compensation in such cases,

      Have agreed as follows:


Article I

      For the purposes of this Convention:

1.    "Ship" means any sea-going vessel and any seaborne craft of
any type whatsoever, actually carrying oil in bulk as cargo.

2.    "Person" means any individual or partnership or any public or
private body, whether corporate or not, including a State or any of
its constituent subdivisions.

3.    "Owner" means the person or persons registered as the owner of
the ship or, in the absence of registration, the person or persons
owning the ship. However in the case of a ship owned by a State and
operated by a company which in that State is registered as the
ship's operator, "owner" shall mean such company.

4.    "State of the ship's registry" means in relation to registered
ships the State of registration of the ship, and in relation to
unregistered ships the State whose flag the ship is flying.

5.    "Oil" means any persistent oil such as crude oil, fuel oil,
heavy diesel oil, lubricating oil and whale oil, whether carried or
in the bunkers of such a ship.

6.    "Pollution damage" means loss or damage caused outside the
ship carrying oil by contamination resulting from the escape or
discharge of oil from the ship, wherever such escape or discharge
may occur, and includes the costs of preventive measures and further
loss or damage caused by preventive measures.

7.    "Preventive measures" means any reasonable measures taken by
any person after an incident had occurred to prevent or minimize
pollution damage.

8.    Incidents means any occurrence, or series of occurrences
having the same origin, which causes pollution damage.
 
9.    "Organization" means the Inter-Governmental Maritime
Consultative Organization.


Article II

      This Convention shall apply exclusively to pollution damage
caused on the territory including the territorial sea of a
Contracting State and to preventive measures taken to prevent or
minimize such damage.


Article III

1.    Except as provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the
owner of a ship at the time of an incident, or where the incident
consists of a series of occurrences at the time of the first such
occurrence, shall be liable for any pollution damage caused by oil
which has escaped or been discharged from the ship as a result of
the incident.

2.    No liability for pollution damage shall attach to the owner if
he proves that the damage:

a)    resulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war,
insurrection or a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable
and irresistible character, or

b)    was wholly caused by an act or omission done with intent to
cause damage by a third party, or 

c )   was wholly caused by the negligence or other wrongful act of
any Government or other authority responsible for the maintenance of
lights or other navigational aids in the exercise of that function.

3.    If the owner proves that the pollution damage resulted wholly
or partially either from an act or omission done with intent to
cause damage by the person who suffered the damage or from the
negligence of that person, the owner may be exonerated wholly or
partially from his liability to such person.

4.    No claim for compensation for pollution damage shall be made
against the owner otherwise than in accordance with this Convention.
No claim for pollution damage under this Convention or otherwise may
be made against the servants or agents of the owner.

5.    Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice any right of
recourse of the owner against third parties.


Article IV

      When oil has escaped or has been discharged from two or more
ships, and pollution damage results therefrom, the owners of all the
ships concerned, unless exonerated under Article III, shall be
jointly and severally liable for all such damage which is not
reasonably reparable.


Article V

1.    The owner of a ship shall be entitled to limit his liability
under this Convention in respect of any one incident to an aggregate
amount of 2,000 francs for each ton of the ship's tonnage. However,
this aggregate amount shall not in any event exceed 210 million
francs.

2.    If the incident occurred as a result of the actual fault or
privity of the owner, he shall not be entitled to avail himself of
the limitation provided in paragraph 1 of this Article.

3.    For the purpose of availing himself of the benefit of
limitation provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article the owner
shall constitute a fund for the total sum representing the limit of
liability with the Court or other competent authority of any one of the
Contracting States in which action is brought under Article IX. The fund can
be constituted either by depositing the sum or by producing a bank
guarantee or other guarantee, acceptable under the legislation of
the Contracting State where the fund is constituted, and considered
to be adequate by the Court or another competent authority.

4.    The fund shall be distributed among the claimants in
proportion to the amounts of their established claims.

5.    If before the fund is distributed the owner or any of his
servants or agents or any person providing him insurance or other
financial security has as a result of the incident in question, paid
compensation for pollution damage, such person shall up to the
amount he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights which the
person so compensated would have enjoyed under this Convention.

6.    The right of subrogation provided for in paragraph 5 of this
Article may also be exercised by a person other than those mentioned
therein in respect of any amount of compensation for pollution
damage which he may have paid but only to the extent that such
subrogation is permitted under the applicable national law.

7.    Where the owner or any other person establishes that he may be
compelled to pay at a later date in whole or in part any such amount
of compensation, with regard to which such person would have enjoyed
a right of subrogation under paragraphs 5 or 6 of this Article, had
the compensation been paid before the fund was distributed, the
Court or other competent authority of the State where the fund has
been constituted may order that a sufficient sum shall be
provisionally set aside to enable such person at such later date to
enforce his claim against the fund.

8.    Claims in respect of expenses reasonably incurred or
sacrifices reasonably made by the owner voluntarily to prevent or
minimize pollution damage shall rank equally with other claims
against the fund.

9.    The franc mentioned in this Article shall be a unit consisting
of sixty-five and a half milligrams of gold of millesimal fineness
nine hundred. The amount mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article
shall be converted into the national currency of the State in which
the fund is being constituted on the basis of the official value of
that currency by reference to the unit defined above on the date of
the constitution of the fund.

10.   For the purpose of this Article the ship's tonnage shall be
the net tonnage of the ship with the addition of the amount deducted
from the gross tonnage on account of engine room space for the
purpose of ascertaining the net tonnage. In the case of a ship which
cannot be measured in accordance with the normal rules of tonnage
measurement, the ship's tonnage shall be deemed to be 40 per cent of
the weight in tons (of 2240 lbs) of oil which the ship is capable of
carrying. 

11.   The insurer or other person providing financial security shall
be entitled to constitute a fund in accordance with this Article on
the same conditions and having the same effect as if it were
constituted by the owner. Such a fund may be constituted even in the
event of the actual fault or privity of the owner but its
constitution shall in that case not prejudice the rights of any
claimant against the owner.


Article VI

1.    Where the owner, after an incident, has constituted a fund in
accordance with Article V, and is entitled to limit his liability,

a)    no person having a claim for pollution damage arising out of
that incident shall be entitled to exercise any right against any
other assets of the owner in respect of such claim;

b)    The Court or other competent authority of any Contracting
State shall order the release of any ship or other property
belonging to the owner which has been arrested in respect of a claim
for pollution damage arising out of that incident, and shall
similarly release any bail or other security furnished to avoid such
arrest.

2.    The foregoing shall, however, only apply if the claimant has
access to the Court administering the fund and the fund is actually
available in respect of his claim.


Article VII

1.    The owner of a ship registered in a Contracting State and
carrying more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo shall be
required to maintain insurance or other financial security, such as
the guarantee of a bank or a certificate delivered by an
international compensation fund in the sums fixed by applying the
limits of liability prescribed in Article V, paragraph 1 to cover
his liability for pollution damage under this Convention.

2.    A certificate attesting that insurance or other financial
security is in force in accordance with the provisions of this
Convention shall be issued to each ship. It shall be issued or
certified by the appropriate authority of the State of the ship's
registry after determining that the requirements of paragraph 1 of
this Article have been complied with. This certificate shall be in
the form of the annexed model and shall contain the following
particulars:

a)    name of ship and port of registration;

b)    name and principal place of business of owner; 

c)    type of security;

d)    name and principal place of business of insurer or other
person giving security and, where appropriate, place of business
where the insurance or security is established;

e)    period of validity of certificate which shall not be longer
than the period of validity of the insurance or other security.

3.    The certificate shall be in the official language or languages
of the issuing State. If the language used is neither English nor
French, the text shall include a translation into one of these
languages.

4.    The certificate shall be carried on board the ship and a copy
shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the
ship's registry.

5.    An insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the
requirements of this Article if it can cease, for reasons other than
the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security
specified in the certificate under paragraph 2 of this Article,
before three months have elapsed from the date on which notice of
its termination is given to the authorities referred to in paragraph
4 of this Article, unless the certificate has been surrendered to
these authorities or a new certificate has been issued within the
said period. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any
modification which results in the insurance or security no longer
satisfying the requirements of this Article.

6.    The State of registry shall, subject to the provisions of this
Article, determine the conditions of issue and validity of the
certificate.

7.    Certificates issued or certified under the authority of a
Contracting State shall be accepted by other Contracting States for
the purposes of this Convention and shall be regarded by other
Contracting States as having the same force as certificates issued
or certified by them. A Contracting State may at any time request
consultation with the State of a ship's registry should it believe
that the insurer or guarantor named in the certificate is not
financially capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this
Convention.

8.    Any claim for compensation for pollution damage may be brought
directly against the insurer or other person providing financial
security for the owner's liability for pollution damage. In such
case the defendant may, irrespective of the actual fault or privity
of the owner, avail himself of the limits of liability prescribed in
Article V, paragraph 1. He may further avail himself of the defences
(other than the bankruptcy or winding up of the owner) which the
owner himself would have been entitled to invoke. Furthermore, the
defendant may avail himself of the defence that the pollution damage
resulted from the wilful misconduct of the owner himself, but the
defendant shall not avail himself of any other defence which he
might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the
owner against him. The defendant shall in any event have the right
to require the owner to be joined in the proceedings.

9.    Any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security
maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be
available exclusively for the satisfaction of claims under this
Convention.

10.   A Contracting State shall not permit a ship under its flag to
which this Article applies to trade unless a certificate has been
issued under paragraph 2 or 12 of this Article.

11.   Subject to the provisions of this Article, each Contracting
State shall ensure, under its national legislation, that insurance
or other security to the extent specified in paragraph 1 of this
Article is in force in respect of any ship, wherever registered,
entering or leaving a port in its territory, or arriving at or
leaving an off-shore terminal in its territorial sea, if the ship
actually carries more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo.

12.   If insurance or other financial security is not maintained in
respect of a ship owned by a Contracting State, the provisions of
this Article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship,
but the ship shall carry a certificate issued by the appropriate
authorities of the State of the ship's registry stating that the
ship is owned by that State and that the ship's liability is covered
within the limits prescribed by Article V, paragraph 1. Such a
certificate shall follow as closely as practicable the model
prescribed by paragraph 2 of this Article.


Article VIII

      Rights of compensation under this Convention shall be
extinguished unless an action is brought thereunder within three
years from the date when the damage occurred. However, in no case
shall an action be brought after six years from the date of the
incident which caused the damage. Where this incident consists of a
series of occurrences, the six years' period shall run from the date
of the first such occurrence.


Article IX

1.    Where an incident has caused pollution damage in the territory
including the territorial sea of one or more Contracting States, or
preventive measures have been taken to prevent or minimize pollution
damage in such territory including the territorial sea, actions for
compensation may only be brought in the Courts of any such
Contracting State or States. Reasonable notice of such action shall
be given to the defendant.

2.    Each Contracting State shall ensure that its Courts possess
the necessary jurisdiction to entertain such actions for
compensation.

3.    After the fund has been constituted in accordance with Article
V the Courts of the State in which the fund is constituted shall be
exclusively competent to determine all matters relating to the
apportionment and distribution of the fund.


Article X

1.    Any judgement given by a Court with jurisdiction in accordance
with Article IX which is enforceable in the State of origin where it
is no longer subject to ordinary forms of review, shall be
recognized in any Contracting State, except;

a)    where the judgement was obtained by fraud; or

b)    where the defendant was given reasonable notice and a fair
opportunity to present his case. 

2.    A judgement recognized under paragraph 1 of this Article shall
be enforceable in each Contracting State as soon as the formalities
required in that State have been complied with. The formalities
shall not permit the merits of the case to be re-opened.


Article XI

1.    The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to warships
or other ships owned or operated by a State and used, for the time
being, only on Government non-commercial service.

2.    With respect to ships owned by a Contracting State and used
for commercial purposes, each State shall be subject to suit in the
jurisdictions set forth in Article IX and shall waive all defences
based on its status as a sovereign State.


Article XII

      This Convention shall supersede any International Conventions
in force or open for signature, ratification or accession at the
