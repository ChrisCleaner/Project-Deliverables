CONVENTION ON THE CONSERVATION OF EUROPEAN WILDLIFE AND NATURAL 
HABITATS

Adopted at Bern on 19 September 1979


PREAMBLE

   The Member States of the Council of Europe and the other 
signatories hereto,

   Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to 
achieve a greater unity between its members;

   Considering the wish of the Council of Europe to co-operate 
with other States in the field of nature conservation;

   Recognizing that wild flora and fauna consitute an natural 
heritage of aesthetic, scientific, cultural, recreational, 
economic and intrinsic value that needs to be preserved and handed 
on to future generations;

   Recognizing the essential role played by wild flora and fauna 
in maintaining biological balances;

   Noting that numerous species of wild flora and fauna are being 
seriously depleted and that some of them are threatened with 
extinction;

   Aware that the conservation of natural habitats is a vital 
component of the protection and conservation of wild flora and 
fauna;

   Recognizing that the conservation of wild flora and fauna 
should be taken into consideration by the governments in their 
national goals and programmes, and that international Co-operation 
should be established to protect migratory species in particular;

   Bearing in mind the widespread requests for common action 
made by governments or by international bodies, in particular the 
requests expressed by the United Nations Conference on the Human 
Environment 1972 and the Consultative Assembly of the Council of 
Europe;

   Desiring particularly to follow, in the field of wildlife 
conservation, the recommendations of Resolution No. 2 of the 
Second European Ministerial Conference on the Environment,

   Have agreed as follows:



Chapter 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS


Article 1

1. The aims of this Convention are to conserve wild flora and

States, and to promote such co-operation.

2. Particular emphasis is given to endangered and vulnerable 
species, including endangered and vulnerable migratory species.


Article 2

   The Contracting Parties shall take requisite measures to 
maintain the population of wild flora and fauna at, or adapt it 
to, a level which corresponds in particular to ecological 
scientific and cultural requirements, while taking account of 
economic and recreational requirements and the needs of 
sub-species, varieties or forms at risk locally.


Article 3

1. Each Contracting Party shall take steps to promote national 
policies for the conservation of wild flora, wild fauna and 
natural habitats, with particular attention to endangered and 
vulnerable species, especially endemic ones, and endangered 
habitats, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.

2. Each Contracting Party undertakes, in its planning and 
development policies and in its measures against pollution, to 
have regard to the conservation of wild flora and fauna.

3. Each Contracting Party shall promote education and disseminate 
general information on the need to conserve species of wild flora 
and fauna and their habitats.



Chapter II
PROTECTION OF HABITATS


Article 4

1. Each Contracting Party shall take appropriate and necessary

policies shall have regard to the conservation requirements of the 
areas protected under the preceding paragraph, so as to avoid or 
minimise as far as possible any deterioration of such areas.

3. The Contracting Parties undertake to give special attention to 
the protection of areas that are of importance for the migratory 
species specified in Appendices II and III and which are 
appropriately situated in relation to migration routes, as
