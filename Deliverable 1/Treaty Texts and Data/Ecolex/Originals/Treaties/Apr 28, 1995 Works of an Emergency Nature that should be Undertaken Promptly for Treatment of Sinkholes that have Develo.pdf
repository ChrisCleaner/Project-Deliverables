<center><b>WORKS OF AN EMERGENCY NATURE THAT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN PROMPTLY
FOR TREATMENT OF SINKHOLES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE RESERVOIR AT AMISTAD
DAM</b></center>

<p>The Commission met at 10:00 a.m. on April 28, 1995, in the offices of
the Mexican Section in Ciudad J&uacute;arez;, Chihuahua to review the conclusions
and recommendations developed by the Prinicpal Engineers based on those
of technical advisers from the United States and M&eacute;xico; regarding
the emergency works that should be undertaken to treat the sinkholes that
have developed on the Mexican side of the reservoir at the Amistad Dam
and for injection of an impermeable grout curtain.
<p>The Commissioners reviewed Commission Minute No. 235, "Division of Operation
and Maintenance Costs at Amistad Dam", signed December 3, 1969, noting
that the "Joint Report of the Principal Engineers Concerning the Division
of Operations and Maintenance Costs of Amistad Dam", signed December 1,
1969, that forms an integral part of that Minute, stipulates:
<p>"Should it become necessary to perform operation, maintenance, or repair
work of an extraordinary or emergency nature which, if not performed promptly
might result in risk of serious damage to the project, or in increased
cost of its performance, the Commission shall order those works executed
which it finds advisable and shall allocate them between the two countries
for their performance as soon as possible, understanding that the performance
by each Government of the work allotted to it, cannot be undertaken until
it has made the necessary financing arrangements therefor."
<p>Further, the Commissioners reviewed and found satisfactory, the "Joint
Report of the Principal Engineers Regarding Works of an Emergency Nature
that Should be Performed Promptly for Treatment of Sinkholes that Have
Developed in the Reservoir at Amistad Dam", signed on February 22,1995
by Principal Engineers Jose S. Valdez and Gilberto Elizalde Hernandez,
of the United States and Mexican Sections, respectively. The Principal
Engineers, in that report, described the studies and investigations performed
by technical advisers from the two countries, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
for the United States and the National Water Commission (CNA) and the Federal
Electricity Commission (CFE) for Mexico, following detection of sinkholes
that have developed on the Mexican side of reservoir some 265 meters from
the dam embankment slope and recommended that works of an emergency nature
should be undertaken promptly. Work should begin with filling of the sinkholes
in a manner described in the report while the storage elevation is low,
followed by work preparatory to injection of the grout curtain, installation
of piezometric stations and injection in 600 meters of a grout curtain
extending 300 meters to each side of Amistad Reservoir Station 7+150. The
Commissioners considered that the work at Amistad Dam should be in accordance
with the following framework:
<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>

<dd>
Fill the sinkholes in the reservoir with the use of inverted filters, depositing
material to its deepest part. The CFE will perform this work immediately
directly through force account.</dd>

<dt>
2.</dt>

<dd>
Work Preparatory to Injection</dd>

<dd>
Instrumentation at three sections to measure groundwater levels, each integrated
by three observation wells one at the upstream slope of the embankment
of the dam and two between the downstream toe of the dam and the Carmina
Arroyo, plus an piezometric station at the downstream toe, with bubble
gages at three different depths for independent wells. In four of the six
borings, samples will be taken for geology investigations purposes.</dd>

<dd>
Basic preliminary laboratory studies by CFE of characteristics of the grout
bed and mortar tentatively selected for the injection of the impermeable
curtain in the foundation.</dd>

<dt>
3.</dt>

<dd>
Injection of an impermeable grout curtain at the rock base of the embankment
between stations 6+850 and 7+450. The effectiveness of this curtain will
be measured through observation wells and piezometers and will allow a
definition of the need for additional grout curtains. At the same time,
the need will be later evaluated for extending the grout injection zone
to one side and the other of the segment indicated above. Mexico will carry
out this work based on a contract to be executed by CNA with a specialized
company principally covering the following:</dd>

<dd>
Perform six borings from the crown of the curtain through the impermeable
core and the foundation to investigate the conditions of the original grout
work.</dd>

<dd>
Drill from crown to curtain through the impermeable core and foundation
rock and inject grout to a depth of about 28 meters.</dd>

<dt>
4.</dt>

<dd>
A preliminary cost of this work, in U.S. dollars is as follows:</dd>
</dl>

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td>o Filling of Sinkholes</td>

<td ALIGN=RIGHT>$50,000.00</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>o Work Preparatory to Grout Curtain Injection</td>

<td ALIGN=RIGHT>$52,000.00</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>o Basic Preliminary Studies</td>

<td ALIGN=RIGHT>$35,000.00</td>

<td ALIGN=RIGHT>$2,600,000.00</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=RIGHT>TOTAL</td>

<td ALIGN=RIGHT>$2,737,000.00</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Since the exact geometry of the sinkholes is not known, it is not possible
to know the exact quantities of work to perform, especially those amounts
for filling the sinkholes. Thus, the CFE will develop a detailed fist of
quantities of work performed to estimate the cost. The total cost of the
grout curtain injection will be known once bids are solicited and the contract
is adjudicated. Actual costs will be known when the work is completed.
<p>Regarding the total costs of the referenced works, estimated at $2,737,000.00,
the Commissioners considered it appropriate that the distribution between
the two countries be at 53.4 percent for the United States and 46.6 percent
for Mexico. To arrive at these percentages, the Commissioners relied on
the authority provided to the Commission in Minute No. 235 regarding the
distribution of costs for operation and maintenance of Amistad Dam. Should
the grout injection be necessary beyond that indicated, the cost of additional
work would be subject of a further arrangement made through the Commission.
<p>The Commissioners observed that each Section should make arrangements
in its respective country to obtain the funds necessary to cover the costs
of the emergency work. Further, they made note that since the work is in
Mexico, that country would make arrangements for contracting and construction
and the United States would reimburse the actual costs corresponding to
the United States based on an exchange rate in effect on the date that
charges are presented by the country performing the work.
<p>At the same time, the Commissioners noted that in view of the urgency
in carrying out the work, should one country obtain funding before the
other, such funds may be utilized to cover the cost of filling the sinkholes
and installing piezometers, with the understanding that funds provided
by the United States will be administered by the Mexican Section, and that
amount be credited to the United States in a final accounting of costs
covered by each country.
<p>Based on the above considerations, the Commission adopted the following
resolutions, subject to the approval of the two Governments:
<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>

<dd>
The "Joint Report of the Principal Engineers Regarding Works of an Emergency
Nature that Should be Performed Promptly for Treatment of Sinkholes that
Have Developed in the Reservoir at Amistad Dam", signed on February 22,1995
by Principal Engineers Jose S. Valdez and Gilberto Elizalde Hernandez,
of the U.S. and Mexican Sections, respectively, is approved and forms a
part of this Minute.</dd>

<dt>
2.</dt>

<dd>
In accordance with provisions of Commission Minute No. 235, these works
are declared to be of an emergency nature, which if not undertaken promptly
might result in risk of serious damage to the dam.</dd>

<dt>
3.</dt>

<dd>
The Commissioners consider that the filling of the sinkholes, the work
preparatory to the impermeable grout curtain injection and the geophysical
studies have an estimated cost of $137,000 U.S. dollars, and the impermeable
curtain injection a cost of approximately $2.6 million U.S. dollars for
a total of approximately $2.737 million U.S. dollars. The Commissioners
consider that an appropriate distribution between the two countries be
in the following proportion: 53.4 percent for the United States and 46.6
percent for Mexico. For this determination, the Commissioners utilized
the powers conferred to the Commission in Minute No. 235 relative to the
distribution of operation and maintenance costs of Amistad Dam, with the
understanding if it becomes necessary to inject the grout curtain beyond
600 meters, the additional cost would be subject to new arrangements through
the Commission.</dd>

<dt>
4.</dt>

<dd>
The sinkhole filling and the work preparatory to the impermeable grout
curtain injection and geophysical studies will be carried out by the National
Electricity Commission of Mexico. The impermeable grout curtain injection
will be carried out by the National Water Commission through a specialized
company.</dd>

<dt>
5.</dt>

<dd>
Each Section will make arrangements in its respective country to obtain
the funds necessary to cover the costs of the emergency nature work, with
the understanding that Mexico would make the contractual arrangements to
perform the construction and the United States would reimburse the costs
corresponding to the United States.</dd>

<dt>
6.</dt>

<dd>
Should one country obtain funding before the other, funds obtained by that
country may be utilized to cover the cost of filling the sinkholes and
installing piezometers, and work prior to the impermeable grout curtain
injection with the understanding that any funds provided by the United
States will be administered by the Mexican Section, and that amount be
credited to the United States' share of the total work in a final accounting
of costs covered by each country.</dd>

<dt>
7.</dt>

<dd>
For the purpose of administration of United States' funds and accounting
for the distribution of costs, an exchange rate would be utilized corresponding
to that in effect on the date that the charges are presented in an amount
corresponding to the United States for the work in accordance to the distribution
agreed.</dd>

<p><b>February 22, 1995</b>
<br><b>El Paso, Texas</b>
<p><b>To The Honorable Commissioners,</b>
<br><b>International Boundary and Water Commission</b>
<br><b>United States and Mexico</b>
<br><b>El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua</b>
<p><b>Sirs:</b>
<p>According to your instructions, we respectfully submit for your consideration
this joint report regarding the works of an emergency nature which should
be performed promptly for the treatment of sinkholes formed on the Mexican
side of the reservoir at Amistad Dam.
<p>The Joint Report of the Principal Engineers "Concerning the Division
of Operation and Maintenance Costs of Amistad Dam" of December 1, 1969,
which forms an integral part of Minute No. 235 of this Commission, entitled
"Division of Operation and Maintenance Costs at Amistad Dam", signed December

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>Since September 1994, the low storage level in the reservoir at Amistad
Dam has permitted the observation of formation of sinkholes on the Mexican
side of this reservoir, located 265 meters from the toe of the dam's embankment
slope. Afterwards, up to 10 sinkholes were discovered, reason for which
this Commission proceeded to undertake observations and studies of this
phenomenon in order to evaluate the situation and propose the necessary
works to assure the safety of this hydraulic structure. For Mexico's part,
the following studies and activities were carried out:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Immediately after discovery of the first sinkholes, daily inspections were
initiated in the sinkhole area, as well as at all the springs and weirs
installed downstream of the dam curtain to collect part of the seepage
water from the sinkholes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
On October 27, November 9 &amp; 15, 1994, independent inspections were
carried out by the Technical Advisers of this International Commission.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Between November 9-25, 1994, the first part of a geophysical investigation
was conducted in an area of approximately 100,000 square meters between
the curtain of the Amistad International Dam and the sinkhole to determine
the geologic, geohydrologic and geotechnical characteristics of the subsoil,
and by this means try to define the pattern of water circulation through
the sinkholes. Afterwards, the geophysical studies were continued to the
end of January 1995.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
On December 5, 1994, exploratory soundings were taken with specialized
equipment and core sampling at sites close to the sinkholes to determine
the thickness of the loam that covers the Georgetown limestone formation
and to correlate the data with any detected geophysical anomalies.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The information concerning the treatment given to the faults discovered
in the foundation during construction of the embankment was analyzed, to
include the grout injection treatment.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
During the observation period, and on various occasions, tracer dye was
applied to the sinkholes to determine the connections between the downstream
springs and the sinkholes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
On December 5, 1994, the clean-up and vegetation removal was initiated
at the springs where the dye applied to the sinkholes was observed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
On December 20, 1994, the United States through its Army Corps of Engineers
conducted a sounding of the sinkhole using a video camera to determine
the dimensions of the same.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Also, during January 11, 12, &amp; 13, 1995, two meetings and an inspection
tour of the sinkhole area as well as the area of springs downstream of
the dam curtain were conducted at Amistad Dam, in which the Advisers of
both countries analyzed all the information available in this matter and
jointly arrived at the following conclusions:</li>
</ul>
<b>CONCLUSIONS OF THE IBWC ADVISERS</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>On January 13, 1995 at a technical meeting of the International Boundary
and Water Commission with the Advisers of both countries at Amistad Dam,
the information compiled in the above referred to studies and activities
was analyzed, and the conclusion was reached that the dam in its present
state does not reflect conditions of risk in the short term as far as its
safety is concerned. Nevertheless, the sinkholes must be closed immediately,
and works to reinforce the impervious grout curtain must be undertaken
as soon as possible in view of the fact that the data reviewed concerning
the injection of the grout curtain effected during construction reveals
that there exists the possibility of zones of flow below the foundation
of the dam. The memorandum of the joint meeting of the Technical Advisers
Group of January 11-13, 1995, at Amistad Dam is enclosed.
<p>Taking the above into consideration, the Advisers recommended the following
repair work of an emergency nature, which if not performed promptly may
result in risk of serious damage to the project:
<dl>
<dt>
l.</dt>

<dd>
Construct a grout curtain starting with a first reach centered at Station
7+150 and extending for 300 meters to each side. This curtain should extend
to elevation 300 meters MSL coinciding with the location of the existing
curtain. The construction of this first reach will permit the mitigation
of the seepage from the sinkhole.</dd>

<dd>
The construction of these grout curtains in other reaches will be defined
after analysis of the information concerning the original grouting in a
similar manner to that effected for the reach from Station 6+500 to Station
7+500 and taking into account the results of the grout reinforcement of
the first reach.</dd>

<dt>
2.</dt>

<dd>
In order to begin the treatment for the initially discovered two sinkholes,
a cofferdam must be constructed around them to elevation 332 meters MSL
and which will also contain the fissure from which air was expelled during
the isolation test for the sinkholes. This treatment will consist of the
placement of a metal tube 12 inches in diameter in the first sinkhole down
to its deepest part to prevent its closure from cave-ins, and allow sealing
with mortar. Next, the sideslopes of the sinkholes will be made more shallow
to stabilize them and to uncover the entrance orifices and facilitate the
placement of an inverted filter. The extent of these excavations will be
defined in accordance with periodic observations by the IBWC Advisers.</dd>

<dt>
3.</dt>

<dd>
The two sinkholes closest to the dam curtain within the reservoir should
be filled with gravel up to a level 20 cm above the water level. Next,
a layer of compacted clay at least 2 meters thick should be placed on top.</dd>

<dt>
4.</dt>

<dd>
In order to carry out the above works, it will be necessary to maintain
the reservoir level at an elevation no greater than 331 meters MSL during
these activities.</dd>

<dt>
5.</dt>

<dd>
Install at least 3 piezometric stations with 3 independent elevation points
each, at the downstream toe of the dam, at Stations 6+950, 7+150, and 7+350.
The tips should be 2 meters long, and the deepest one installed at approximately
elevation 300 meters MSL, and the other two will be defined according to
the results of the bore hole samples of the deepest piezometer, trying
to place these tips at the most pervious elevations.</dd>

<dt>
6.</dt>

<dd>
Activities 2, 3, and 5 should be accomplished before the initiation of
construction of the reinforcement grout curtain.</dd>

<dt>
7.</dt>

<dd>
In order to improve the knowledge of the stratigraphy and structural geology
of the area of influence of the seepages on the right side of the embankment
of the dam and in order to anticipate future problems, it is recommended
to make a surface geologic study of the area.</dd>

<dt>
8.</dt>

<dd>
The general specifications to carry out these activities and their estimated
costs will be prepared jointly by engineers of the Comision Nacional del
Agua (National Water Commission) and the Comision Federal de Electricidad
(Federal Electricity Commission of Mexico). Later, they will be submitted
for consideration to the IBWC for its review and approval.</dd>

<dt>
9.</dt>

<dd>
Once the above recommended actions have been approved, the activities related
to Points 2 and 3 should be initiated immediately, even if the other specifications
are not yet available.</dd>

<dt>
10.</dt>

<dd>
During the progress of the above activities, it is recommended to schedule
joint evaluation visits of the Advisers of the IBWC, for their review and
in order to propose, as necessary, the modifications which they consider
pertinent,</dd>

<dt>
11.</dt>

<dd>
As a complement to the above activities, it is proposed:</dd>

<dd>
a)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
To continue with the systematic gaging of the spring weirs as well as the
qualitative observation of those that have no weirs.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
b)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
To determine the elevations of the outlet rims of all springs and of the
bore holes that are being drilled.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
c)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
To continue with the periodic inspections along the dam.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
d)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
To measure the water levels in the sinkholes with the necessary frequency.</dd>
</dl>
</dl>
<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
<p>Based on the above conclusions and with which we are in total agreement,
we respectfully recommend:
<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>

<dd>
That the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and
Mexico, approve the above recommended actions proposed by its Advisers,
which are of an emergency nature, which if not performed promptly may result
in serious damage to the project.</dd>

<dt>
2.</dt>

<dd>
That the Commission order the above emergency nature works executed as
soon as possible, consistent with the following schedule:</dd>

<dd>
a)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
That the filling of the sinkholes be carried out before the reserve is
filled since its filling would delay the repair works and cause the cavity
beneath the dam to enlarge and cause the possible failure of the structure;</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
b)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
That the treatment of the sinkholes should be undertaken immediately before
a period of 30 to 60 days; and</dd>
</dl>
</dl>

<dd>
c)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
That the remaining activities, including the grout curtain that can be
undertaken independently of the lake elevation, should be undertaken in
a period of six months to a maximum of one year from January 1995.</dd>
</dl>

<dt>
3.</dt>

<dd>
That the Commissioners, establish by a Commission Minute, consistent with
Minute No. 235, the distribution between the two Governments of costs of
the referenced work to allow each Section of the Commission, to take the
necessary actions in its respective country to obtain the funds necessary
for their execution in the shortest possible time.</dd>
