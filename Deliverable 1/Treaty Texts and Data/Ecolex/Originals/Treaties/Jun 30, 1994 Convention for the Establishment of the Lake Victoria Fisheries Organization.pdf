PREAMBLE

The Governments of the Republic of Kenya, the Republic of Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania, hereinafter referred to as the "Contracting Parties"

Recognizing and acknowledging the efforts already made by the three riparian States of Lake Victoria to strengthen regional cooperation in the spirit of the Agreement for the Establishment of a Permanent Tripartite Commission for cooperation among them signed in Arusha on 30 November 1993;

Recognizing that the quantity and value of landings from Lake Victoria fisheries have increased substantially during the past decade, and that there is a need to ensure the sustainability of yields;

Recognizing that introduced fish species, for example the Nile Tilapia and the Nile Perch, now dominate commercial catches and that some indigenous fish species have substantially declined, affecting the biodiversity of the Lake;

Recognizing the likelihood that management decisions relating to any portion of Lake Victoria within the territorial limits of any one of the Contracting Parties will affect those portions of Lake Victoria lying within the territorial limits of the other Contracting Parties, and the concomitant necessity that management decisions be made taking such effects into account;

Recognizing the continuing need to increase scientific understanding of Lake Victoria, its living resources, its ecosystem, and the impact on those resources of climate, human populations and settlement, non-indigenous wildlife and industrialization;

Being aware of the dangers of over-fishing and of other threats such as water hyacinth, pollution, eutrophication and climatic changes to the sustainability of yields;
