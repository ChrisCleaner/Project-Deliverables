THE PARTIES TO THE PRESENT PROTOCOL, 

BEING PARTIES to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, done at Brussels on 29 November 1969; 

HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS: 


Article I

For the purpose of the present Protocol: 
1. "Convention" means the International convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969. 
2. "Organization" has the same meaning as in the convention. 
3. "Secretary-General" means the Secretary-General of the Organization. 


Article II

Article V of the Convention is amended as follows: 
(1) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following text: 
"The owner of a ship shall be entitled to limit his liability under this Convention in respect of any one incident to an aggregate amount of 133 units of account for each ton of the ship's tonnage. However, this aggregate amount shall not in any event exceed 14 million units of account." 
(2) Paragraph 9 is replaced by the following text: 
9. (a) The "unit of account" referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be converted into the national currency of the State in which the fund is being constituted on the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date of the constitution of the fund. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect at the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State. 
9. (b) Nevertheless, a contracting State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 9(a) of this Article may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to the present Convention, or at any time thereafter, declare that the limits of liability provided for in paragraph 1 to be applied in its territory shall, in respect of any one incident, be an aggregate of 2,000 monetary units for each ton of the ship's tonnage provided that this aggregate amount shall not in any event exceed 210 million monetary units. The monetary unit referred to in this paragraph corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of these amounts into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned. 
9. (c) The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 9(a) and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 9(b) shall be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the Contracting State as far as possible that same real value for the amounts in paragraph 1 as is expressed there in units of account. Contracting States shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 9(a), or the result of the conversion in paragraph 9(b) as the cause may be, when depositing an instrument referred to in Article IV and whenever there is a change in either.
