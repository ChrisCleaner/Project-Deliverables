2. The eastern boundary at the meridian 40º East shall be reviewed if a convention for the conservation of the living resources of the sea is established applying to an area immediately adjacent to that boundary.
ARTICLE II
Nothing in this Convention shall be considered as affecting the rights, claims or views of any Contracting Party in regard to the limits of the territorial sea or to the extent of jurisdiction over fisheries under international law.
ARTICLE III
This Convention shall apply to all fish and other living resources in the Convention Area, with the exception of any such resources as may be excluded pursuant to arrangements or agreements entered into by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article XI of this Convention.
ARTICLE IV
The Contracting Parties hereby agree to establish and to maintain a Commission to be known as the International Commission for the Southeast Atlantic Fisheries, hereinafter referred to as the " Commission," which shall carry out the functions set forth in this Convention.

ANNEX II TO THE FINAL ACT
RESOLUTION NO. 1
THE CONFERENCE
Agreeing that it is highly desirable and necessary to establish machinery for adequate medical, technical and meteorological services for the protection of the fishermen working on board fishing vessels on the high seas in the area covered by the Convention on the Conservation of the Living Resources of the Southeast Atlantic;
Considering that, in the opinion of the Delegates present, it is possible and desirable to create an international system which would provide an effective solution to the problems of deepsea fishermen, in the Convention Area, with regard to cases of acute illness or the consequences of accidents or other perils to which fishermen may fall victim;
Suggests to all countries adjoining the Southeast Atlantic area or having fisheries interests therein, and who are eligible to become members of the Commission under the above-mentioned Convention, that they should collaborate, in conjunction with any specialized agencies of the United Nations which they deem appropriate, in establishing an international service for the protection of fishermen working in the Convention Area; and further
Invites the member countries of the Commission to develop a plan designed to meet the aims set forth in this Resolution. 

ANNEX III TO THE FINAL ACT
RESOLUTION NO. 2
THE CONFERENCE
Noting that certain stocks in the Convention Area appear to be heavily exploited, as described in Supplement 1 to the Report of the fifth session (July 1968) of the FAO Advisory Committee on Marine Resources Research (ACMRR), and that measures to conserve these stocks are being urgently needed;
Recognizing that the formulation of necessary measures should be based on sound scientific advice, and that such advice is best obtained from working parties of scientists in which the expertise and data from all countries can be combined;
Noting that the studies reported in the above-mentioned ACMRR Report were based on data not more recent than 1967, and that the proposed Commission on the Conservation of the Living Resources of the Southeast Atlantic will not itself be able to set up such a group for some time;
Believing that it would greatly assist the proposed Commission at its first session if a similar group could meet and prepare a further report on the state of the stocks and on the effect of possible regulatory measures, for submission to member countries in advance of the first session;
Urges all countries that are eligible to become a party to the Convention that exploit the resources of the Southeast Atlantic to facilitate the attendance of suitable experts, and to arrange for the submission of statistical and other material; and
Invites the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to consult with all the countries invited to participate in the Conference with a view to his providing facilities for the holding of a meeting in Rome, as soon as possible after the first session of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, 1-6 December 1969.
