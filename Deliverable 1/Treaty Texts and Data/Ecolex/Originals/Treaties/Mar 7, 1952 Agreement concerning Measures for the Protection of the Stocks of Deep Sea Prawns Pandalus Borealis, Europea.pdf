The Governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, being desirous of 
concluding an agreement relating to measures for the protection of 
stocks of deep-sea prawns (Pandalus borealis), European lobsters 
(Homarus vulgaris), Norway lobsters (Nephrops norvegicus) and 
crabs (Cancer pagurus), have agreed as follows:

waters bounded on the west by a line from Lindesnes light to 
Hanstholm light and on the east by the 13th meridian east of 
Greenwich.


Article 2

  No vessel may use or have on board any prawn trawl which does 
not comply with the provisions of article 3 of this Agreement.


Article 3

  The minimum size of the mesh of a prawn trawl shall be such 
that a flat measure 30 mm. wide and 2 mm. thick can be easily 
passed between the meshes when the trawl is wet and spread out 
lengthwise.


Article 4

  No vessel shall keep on board any Norway lobsters (Nephrops 
norvegicus) under 15 cm. in length measured from the tip of the 
frontal horn to the anterior fixed side of the middle swimming 
appendage.


Article 5

  The provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to fishery 
research conducted by, or with the consent of, the public 
authorities.


Article 6

such regulations as are necessary to give effect to the provisions 
of this Agreement, including the provisions which prohibit the 
landing or selling in their territories of Norway lobsters under 
the prescribed minimum size.


Article 7

  A commission shall be set up consisting of two representatives 
(one representative for scientific research in fishing and one for

purpose of the commission shall be to attempt to coordinate the 
scientific and practical research conducted by the various 
countries with regard to stocks of prawns, European lobsters, 
Norway lobsters and crabs in the area to which the Agreement 
applies. The commission shall also, on the basis of available

existing measures for the protection of stocks of the 
aforementioned shell-fish or for introducing other measures, and, 
as the circumstances require, shall make appropriate 
recommendations to the Contracting Governments. The commission 
shall itself determine its procedure and when it shall meet. The 
first meeting of the commission shall be called by the Norwegian 
Government.

  This Agreement shall be ratified and shall come into force two 
months after the instruments of ratification are deposited with 
the Norwegian Government, which shall inform the Contracting 
Governments of the deposit of the ratifications and of the date on 
which the Agreement is to come into force.

  After three years from it coming into force, this Agreement may 
be denounced by a notice in writing addressed to the Norwegian 
Government. The denunciation shall take effect in respect of the 
Government concerned six months after the date of receipt. Notice 
of the denunciation shall be given to all the Contracting Parties 
by the Norwegian Government.
