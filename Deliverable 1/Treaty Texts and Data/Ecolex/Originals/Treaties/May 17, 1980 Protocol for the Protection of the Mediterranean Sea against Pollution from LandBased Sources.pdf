PROTOCOL FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA AGAINST
POLLUTION FROM LAND-BASED SOURCES*

Adopted at Athens on 17 May 1980


      The Contracting Parties to the present Protocol,

      Being Parties to the Convention for the Protection of the
Mediterranean Sea Against Pollution, adopted at Barcelona on 16
February 1976,

      Desirous of implementing Article 4, paragraph 2, and Articles
8 and 15 of the said Convention,

      Noting the rapid increase of human activities in the
Mediterranean Sea Area, particularly in the fields of
industrialization and urbanization, as well as the seasonal increase
in the coastal population due to tourism,

      Recognizing the danger posed to the marine environment and to
human health by pollution from land-based sources and the serious
problems resulting therefrom in many coastal waters and river
estuaries of the Mediterranean Sea, primarily due to the release of
untreated, insufficiently treated or inadequately disposed of
domestic or industrial discharges,

      Recognizing the difference in levels of development between
the coastal States, and taking account of the economic and social
imperatives of the developing countries,

      Determined to take in close co-operation the necessary
measures to protect the Mediterranean Sea against pollution from
land-based sources,

      Have agreed as follows:


Article 1

      The Contracting Parties to this Protocol (hereinafter referred
to as "the Parties") shall take all appropriate measures to prevent,
abate, combat and control pollution of the Mediterranean Sea Area
caused by discharges from rivers, coastal establishments or
outfalls, or emanating from any other land-based sources within
their territories.


Article 2

      For the purposes of this Protocol:

(a)   "The Convention" means the Convention for the Protection of
the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution, adopted at Barcelona on 16
February 1976;

(b)   "Organization" means the body referred to in Article 13 of the
Convention;

(c)   "Freshwater limit" means the place in watercourses where, at
low tides and in a period of low freshwater flow, there is an
appreciable increase in salinity due to the presence of sea-water.


Article 3

      The area to which this Protocol applies (hereinafter referred
to as the "Protocol Area") shall be:

a)    The Mediterranean Sea Area as defined in article 1 of the
Convention;

b)    Waters on the landward side of the baselines from which the
breadth of the territorial sea is measured and extending, in the
case of watercourses, up to the freshwater limit;

c)    Saltwater marshes communicating with the sea.


Article 4

1.    This Protocol shall apply:

(a)   To polluting discharges reaching the Protocol Area from land-
based sources within the territories of the Parties, in particular:

 - directly, from outfalls discharging into the sea or through
coastal disposal;

 - indirectly, through rivers, canals or other watercourses,
including underground watercourses, or through run-off;

(b)   To pollution from land-based sources transported by the
atmosphere, under conditions to be defined in an additional annex to
this Protocol and accepted by the Parties in conformity with the
provisions of Article 17 of the Convention.

2.    This Protocol shall also apply to polluting discharges from
fixed man-made offshore structures which are under the jurisdiction
of a Party and which serve purposes other than exploration and
exploitation of mineral resources of the continental shelf and the
sea-bed and its subsoil.


Article 5

1.    The Parties undertake to eliminate pollution of the Protocol
Area from land-based sources by substances listed in Annex I to this
Protocol.

2.    To this end they shall elaborate and implement, jointly or
individually, as appropriate, the necessary programmes and measures.

3.    These programmes and measures shall include, in particular,
common emission standards and standards for use.

4.    The standards and the timetables for the implementation of the
programmes and measures aimed at eliminating pollution from land-
based sources shall be fixed by the Parties and periodically
reviewed, if necessary every two years, for each of the substances
listed in Annex I in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of
this Protocol.


Article 6

1.    The Parties shall strictly limit pollution from land-based
sources in the Protocol Area by substances or sources listed in
Annex II to this Protocol.

2.    To this end they shall elaborate and implement, jointly or
individually, as appropriate, suitable programmes and measures.

3.    Discharges shall be strictly subject to the issue, by the
competent national authorities, of an authorization taking due
account of the provisions of Annex III to this Protocol.


Article 7

1.    The Parties shall progressively formulate and adopt, in co-
operation with the competent international organizations, common
guidelines and as appropriate, standards or criteria dealing in
particular with:

(a)   The length, depth and position of pipelines for coastal
outfalls, taking into account, in particular, the methods used for
pretreatment of effluents;

(b)   Special requirements for effluents necessitating separate
treatment;

(c)   The quality of sea-water used for specific purposes that is
necessary for the protection of human health, living resources and
ecosystems;

(d)   The control and progressive replacement of products,
installations and industrial and other processes causing significant
pollution of the marine environment;

(e)   Specific requirements concerning the quantities of the
substances listed in Annexes I and II discharged, their
concentration in effluents and methods of discharging them.

2.    Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 5 of this
Protocol, such common guidelines, standards or criteria shall take
into account local ecological, geographical and physical
characteristics, the economic capacity of the Parties and their need
for development, the level of existing pollution and the real
absorptive capacity of the marine environment.

3.    The programmes and measures referred to in Articles 5 and 6
shall be adopted by taking into account, for their progressive
implementation, the capacity to adapt and reconvert existing
installations, the economic capacity of the Parties and their need
for development.


Article 8

      Within the framework of the provisions of, and the monitoring
programmes provided for, in Article 10 of the Convention, and if
necessary in co-operation with the competent international
organizations, the Parties shall carry out at the earliest possible
date monitoring activities in order:

pollution along their coasts, in particular with regard to the
substances or sources listed in Annexes I and II, and periodically
to provide information in this respect;

to reduce pollution of the marine environment.


Article 9

      In conformity with Article 11 of the Convention, the Parties
shall co-operate as far as possible in scientific and technological

technology, with a view to preventing pollution from land-based
sources and its harmful effects in the marine environment.

2.    Technical assistance would include, in particular, the
training of scientific and technical personnel, as well as the
acquisition, utilization and production by those countries of
appropriate equipment on advantageous terms to be agreed upon among
the Parties concerned.


Article 11

territories of two or more Parties or forms a boundary between them
are likely to cause pollution of the marine environment of the
Protocol Area, the Parties in question, respecting the provisions of
this Protocol in so far as each of them is concerned, are called
upon to co-operate with a view to ensuring its full application.

2.    A Party shall not be responsible for any pollution originating

when land-based pollution originating from the territory of one
Party is likely to prejudice directly the interest of one or more of
the other Parties, the Parties concerned shall, at the request of
one or more of them, undertake to enter into consultation with a
view to seeking a satisfactory solution.

2.    At the request of any Party concerned, the matter shall be
placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the Parties held in

effect on the oxygen content of the marine environment, especially
those which may cause eutrophication.

12.   Acid or alkaline compounds of such composition and in such
quantity that they may impair the quality of sea-water.

13.   Substances which, though of a non-toxic nature, may become
harmful to the marine environment or may interfere with any

substances referred to in section A above must be implemented in
accordance with Annex III.
