PROTOCOL FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE SOUTH-EAST PACIFIC AGAINST 
POLLUTION FROM LAND-BASED SOURCES

Quito, 23 July 1983


Article I 

AREA OF APPLICATION

The sphere of application of this Protocol shall be the area of 
the South-East Pacific* within the 200-mile maritime area of 
sovereignty and jurisdiction of the High Contracting Parties and 
waters on the landward side up to the freshwater limit.

* The geographical coverage of this Protocol comprises the 
200-mile maritime area of sovereignty and jurisdiction of the 
High Contracting Parties.

The fresh-water limit will be determined by each State Party, in 
accordance with the relevant technical and scientific criteria.


Article II

SOURCES OF POLLUTION

Marine pollution from land-based sources comprises:

(a) Coastal outfalls or disposal and discharges;

(b) Discharges through rivers, canals and other watercourses, 
including underground watercourses; and

(c) In general, any other land-based source situated within the 
territories of the High Contracting Parties, whether through 
water, through the atmosphere or directly from the coast.


Article III

GENERAL OBLIGATIONS

The High Contracting Parties shall, either individually or 
through bilateral or multilateral cooperation. endeavour to adopt 
appropriate measures in accordance with the provisions of this 
Protocol to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine 
environment from land-based sources, which results or is likely 
to result in such deleterious effects as harm to living resources 
and marine life, hazards to human health, hindrance to marine 
activities, including fishing and other legitimate uses of the 
sea, impairment of quality for the use of sea water and reduction 
of amenities.

The High Contracting Parties shall adopt laws and regulations to 
prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment 
from land-based sources including rivers, estuaries, pipelines 
and outfall structures, taking into account internationally 
agreed rules, standards and recommended practices and procedures.

The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to harmonize their 
policies in this connection at the regional level.



Article IV 

OBLIGATIONS IN RESPECT OF ANNEX I

The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to prevent, reduce, 
control and eliminate in their respective zones within the sphere 
of application of this Protocol pollution from land-based sources 
caused by the substances listed in annex I to this Protocol. To 
this end they shall, jointly or individually, elaborate and 
implement suitable programmes and measures.

Such programmes and measures shall take into account, for their 
progressive implementation, the capacity to adapt and reconvert 
existing installations, the economic capacity of the Parties and 
their need for development.

Without prejudice to the aim of eliminating discharges of the 
substances listed in annex I, to the extent that such substances 
occur, they shall be subject to a system of self-monitoring and 
control. Authorization by the competent national authorities 
shall depend upon the levels of such substances, taking into 
account the harm or deleterious effects which may result in the 
marine environment.


Article V 

OBLIGATIONS IN RESPECT OF ANNEX II

The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour progressively to 
reduce in their respective zone within the sphere of application 
of this Protocol pollution from land-based sources caused by the 
substances or sources listed in annex II to this Protocol. To 
this end they shall, jointly or individually, elaborate and 
implement suitable programmes and measures.

Such programmes and measures shall take into account, for their 
progressive implementation, the capacity to adapt and reconvert 
existing installations, the economic capacity of the Parties and 
their need for development.

Discharges of the substances listed in annex II to this Protocol 
shall be subject to a system of self-monitoring and control. 
Authorization by the competent national authorities shall depend 
on the levels of such substances, taking into account the harm or 
deleterious effects which may result in the marine environment.


Article VI

PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES

The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to formulate and 
progressively adopt, acting individually or jointly as 
appropriate, in co-operation with the Executive Secretariat or 
another competent international organization, as the case may be, 
rules, standards and common practices and procedures dealing 
with:

(a) Studies to determine the length, depth and position of 
coastal outfalls;

(b) Special requirements for effluents necessitating separate 
treatment;

(c) The quality of sea water necessary to guarantee the 
preservation of human health, living resources and ecosystems;

(d) The control of products, installations and industrial and 
other processes causing significant pollution from land-based 
sources;

(e) Special studies concerning the quantities discharged with a 
view to controlling the concentration of substances in effluents 
and the method of discharging the substances listed in annexes I 
and II, in order to comply with the provisions of subparagraph 
(c) of this article.

Such rules, standards, practices and procedures shall take into 
account local ecological, geographical and physical 
characteristics, the economic capacity of the Parties and their 
need for development, the level of existing pollution and the 
real absorptive capacity of the marine environment.


Article VII

CO-OPERATION AMONG THE PARTIES

High Contracting Parties requiring assistance in combating 
pollution from land-based sources may, either directly or through 
the Executive Secretariat, request the co-operation of other 
Parties, especially those which may be affected by the pollution.

Such co-operation may include expert advice and the provision of 
equipment and materials necessary to combat the pollution.

The High Contracting Parties to which a request has been 
addressed shall, as soon as possible, consider the request and 
shall meet it to the extent of their capabilities and shall 
immediately inform the requesting Party of the form, extent and 
conditions of the co-operation they are in a position to provide.


Article VIII

MONITORING PROGRAMMES

The High Contracting Parties shall, directly or in co-operation 
with the Executive Secretariat or another competent international 
organization, progressively establish individual or joint

jointly by the Parties.


Annex II


A. The following substances, families and groups of substances, 
or sources of pollution, listed not in order of priority for the 
purposes of article V of this Protocol, have been selected mainly 
on the basis of criteria used for annex I, while taking into 
account the fact that they are generally less noxious or are more 
readily rendered harmless by natural processes and therefore 
generally affect more limited coastal areas.

quantity that they may impair the quality of sea water.

13. Substances which, though of a non-toxic nature, may become 
harmful to the marine environment or may interfere with any 
legitimate use of the sea owing to the quantities in which they 
are discharged.

B. The control and strict limitation of the discharge of 
substances referred to in section A above must be implemented in 
accordance with annex III.


Annex III

C. CHARACTERISTICS OF DISCHARGE SITE AND RECEIVING MARINE 
ENVIRONMENT

1. Hydrographic, meteorological, geological and topographic 
characteristics of the coastal area.

2. Location and type of discharge (outfall, canal, outlet, etc.) 
and its relation to other areas (such as amenity areas, spawning, 
nursery, and fishing areas, shellfish grounds) and other 
discharges.

3. Initial dilution achieved at the point of discharge into the 
receiving marine environment.

4. Dispersion characteristics such as effect of currents, tides 
and wind on horizontal transport and vertical mixing.
