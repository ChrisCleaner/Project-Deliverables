<p>The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) met the Offices
of the United States Section at 8:00 p.m. in El Paso, Texas on November
13, 1992 to consider the recommendations of United States Section Principal
Engineer Conrad G. Keyes, Jr. and Mexican Section Principal Engineer Luis
Antonio Rascon Mendoza regarding a proposed program of sampling and analyses
of the waters of the Rio Grande in the international reach from El Paso,
Texas - Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Chihuahua to the Gulf of Mexico with the
objective of determining the presence of toxic substances, in the context
of agreements and understandings between the United States and Mexico for
the observation of the quality of the waters along the United States/Mexico
border. The Commissioners observed that a United States - Mexico program
for observation of the quality of the waters of the Rio Grande and the
Colorado River, which form the international boundary, and of those streams
that cross the international boundary are contemplated in the Joint Memorandum
of IBWC Engineers entitled "Recommendation of an Initial International
Program for Observation of the Quality of the International Waters of the
United States and Mexico," dated July 5, 1977, approved by the IBWC in
the U.S. Commissioner's letter of July 9, 1977 and the Mexican commissioner's
letter of July 14, 1977. Further, the commissioners observed the stipulations
in Minute No. 261 entitled "Recommendations for the Solution to the Border
Sanitation Problems," dated September 24, 1979 regarding identification
and solution of border sanitation problems in the waters that flow in the
boundary rivers or cross the border, including coastal waters. The Commissioners
also noted the specific monitoring program in Minute No. 264 "Recommendations
for Solution of the New River Border Sanitation Problem at Calexico, California
- Mexicali, Baja California Norte," dated August 26, 1980. Finally, the
Commissioners alluded to the requirement in Minute No. 279 entitled "Joint
Measures to Improve the Quality of the Waters of the Rio Grande at Laredo,
Texas/Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas," dated August 28, 1989 to continue an intensive
water quality monitoring program for the Rio Grande. The Commissioners
made note of the increased cooperation between the United States and Mexico
on water quality matters reflected in the Integrated Border Environment
Plan (IBEP) approved by United States President George W. Bush and Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on February 25, 1992. Specifically,
in the IBEP, is the understanding that in cooperation with the responsible
agencies of both countries, the IBWC will develop an appropriate monitoring
program and data base for the observation of the quality of the surface
and ground waters .long the United States/Mexico border. In the United
States, those agencies are the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the National Park Service (NPS), the Texas
Water Commission (TWC), the Texas Department of Health, (TDH) and the Texas
Department of Parks and Wildlife (TDPW). In Mexico, those agencies are
the Secretariat of Social Development (SEDESOL), the National Water Commission
(CNA), and the state and municipal agencies responsible for water management
in the states bordering the United states. The Commissioners then reviewed
the "Joint Report of the Principal Engineers Relative to Determination
of Presence of Toxic Substances in the Waters of the Rio Grande in its
International Boundary Reach," signed on November 11, 1992 by Principal
Engineers Conrad G. Keyes, Jr. and Luis Antonio Rascon Mendoza, of the
United States and Mexican Sections, respectively, and concluded that the
joint sampling sites, parameters, sampling processing, laboratory analyses,
control of results in a computerized international data bank, and a schedule
for undertaking the program satisfy the intensive water quality observation
needs for the waters of the Rio Grande stipulated partly in Minute No.
279 and partly in the water quality monitoring program and database understandings
in the IBES. Based on the foregoing, the Commissioners submit the following
recommendations for the approval of the two Governments.:
<dir>1. The "Joint Report of the Principal Engineers Relative to Determination
of Presence of Toxic Substances in the Water. of the Rio Grande in its
International Boundary Reach," signed on November 11, 1992 by Principal
Engineers Conrad G. Keys, Jr. and Luis Antonio Rascon Mendoza, of the United
States and Mexican Sections, respectively, which forms a part of this Minute
is approved.
<br>2. The IBWC, within six months from the date of the results of the
program in referenced joint report, in order to satisfy the understanding
in the Integrated Border Environment Plan, referenced in this minute, will
recommend to the two Governments, in a Minute, improvements to the Joint
Memorandum the IBWC Engineers entitled Recommendation of an Initial International
Program for Observation of the Quality of the International Waters of the
United states and Mexico,' dated July 5, 1977, approved by the IBWC in
the U.S. commissioners letter of July 9, 1977 and the Mexican Commissioner's
letter of July 14, 1977, giving special attention to the Rio Grande and
Colorado River.</dir>
