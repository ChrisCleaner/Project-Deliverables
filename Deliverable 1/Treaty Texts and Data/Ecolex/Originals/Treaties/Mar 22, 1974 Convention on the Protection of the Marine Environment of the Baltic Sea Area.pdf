of this Annex.


Regulation 4
Oil

      The Contracting Parties shall as soon as possible but not later
than 1 January 1977 or on the date of entry into force of the present
Convention, whichever occurs later, apply the provisions of Paragraph
A to D of this Regulation on methods for the prevention of pollution
by oil from ships while operating in the Baltic Sea Area.

A. Definitions

      For the purposes of this Regulation:

1.    "Oil" means petroleum in any form including crude oil, fuel oil,
sludge, oil refuse and refined products (other than petrochemicals
which are subject to the provisions of Regulation 5 of this Annex) and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes the
substances listed in Appendix I to this Annex. 

2.    "Oily mixture" means a mixture with any oil content.

3.    "Oil fuel" means any oil used as fuel in connection with the
propulsion and auxiliary machinery of the ship in which such oil is
carried.

4.    "Oil tanker" means a ship constructed or adapted primarily to
carry oil in bulk in its cargo space and includes combination carriers
and any "chemical tanker" as defined in Regulation 5 of this Annex when
it is carrying a cargo or part cargo of oil in bulk.

5.    "Combination carrier" means a ship designed to carry either oil
or solid cargoes in bulk.

6.    "Clean ballast" means the ballast in a tank which since oil was
last carried therein has been so cleaned that effluent therefrom if it
were discharged from a ship which is stationery into clean water on a
clear day would not produce visible traces of oil on the surface of the
water or on adjoining shore lines or cause a sludge or emulsion to be
deposited beneath the surface of the water or upon adjoining shore
lines. If the ballast is discharged through an oil discharge monitoring
and control system approved by the Administration, evidence based on
such a system to the effect that the oil content of the effluent did
not exceed 15 parts per million shall be determinative that the ballast
was clean, notwithstanding the presence of visible trace.

7.    "Segregated ballast" means the ballast water introduced into a
tank which is completely separated from the cargo oil and oil fuel
system and which is permanently allocated to the carriage of ballast
or to the carriage of ballast or cargoes other than oil or noxious
substances as variously defined in the Regulations of this Annex.

B. Control of discharge of oil

1.    a) Subject to the provisions of Paragraph C of this Regulation,
any discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixtures from any oil tanker
and any ship of 400 tons gross tonnage and above other than an oil
tanker shall be prohibited, while in the Baltic Sea Area;

b)    such ships while in the Baltic Sea Area shall retain on board all
oil drainage and sludge, dirty ballast and tank washings waters and
discharge them only to reception facilities.

2.    a) Subject to the provisions of Paragraph C of this Regulation,
any discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixtures from a ship of less
than 400 tons gross tonnage, other than an oil tanker, shall be
prohibited while in the Baltic Sea Area, except when the oil content
of the effluent without dilution does not exceed 15 parts per million
or alternatively when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

      (i)   the ship is proceeding en route;

      (ii)  the oil content of the effluent is less than 100 parts per
            million; and 

      (iii) the discharge is made as far as practicable from the land,
            but in no case less than 12 nautical miles from the nearest
            land;

b)    no discharge into the sea shall contain chemicals or other
substances in quantities or concentrations which are hazardous to the
marine environment or chemicals or other substances introduced for the
purpose of circumventing the conditions of discharge specified in this
Regulation;

c)    the oil residues which cannot be discharged into the sea in
compliance with Sub-Paragraph 2 (a) of this Paragraph shall be retained
on board or discharged to reception facilities.

3.    The provisions of this Paragraph shall apply to the discharge of
clean or segregated ballast.

4.    Whenever visible traces of oil are observed on or below the
surface of the water in the immediate vicinity of a ship or its wake,
the Contracting Parties should, to the extent they are reasonably able
to do so, promptly investigate the facts bearing on the issue of
whether there has been a violation of the provisions of this
Regulation. The investigation should include, in particular, the wind
and sea conditions, the track and speed of the ship, other possible
sources of the visible traces in the vicinity, and any relevant oil
discharge records.

C.  Exceptions

Paragraph B of this Regulation shall not apply to:

a)    the discharge into the sea of oil mixtures necessary for the
purpose of safety of a ship or saving life at sea; or 

b)    the discharge into the sea of oil mixtures resulting from damage
to a ship or its equipment:

      (i)  provided that all reasonable precautions have been taken
           after the occurrence of the damage or discovery of the
           discharge for the purpose of preventing or minimizing the
           discharge; and

      (ii) except if the owner or the Master acted either with intent
           to cause damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that
           damage would probably result; or

c)     the discharge into the sea of substances containing oil, approved
by the Administration, when being used for the purpose of combating
specific pollution incidents in order to minimize the damage from
pollution. Any such discharge shall be subject to the approval of any
Contracting Party in whose jurisdiction it is contemplated the
discharge will occur.

D. Special requirements for drilling rigs and other platforms

      Fixed and floating drilling rigs when engaged in the exploration,
exploitation and associated offshore processing of sea-bed mineral
resources and other platforms shall comply with the requirements of
this Regulation applicable to ships of 400 tons gross tonnage and above
other than oil tankers, except that:

a)    they shall keep a record of all operations involving oil or oily
mixture discharges, in a form approved by the Administration; and

b)    subject to the provisions of Paragraph C of this Regulation, the
discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixture shall be prohibited
except when the oil content of the discharge without dilution does not
exceed 15 parts per million.

E. Reception facilities of the baltic sea area

      The Contracting parties undertake to ensure that not later than
1 January 1977 all oil loading terminals and repair ports of the Baltic
Sea Area are provided with facilities adequate for the reception and
treatment of all the dirty ballast and tank washing waters from oil
tankers. In addition all ports of the area shall be provided with
adequate reception facilities for other residues and oily mixtures from
all ships. Such facilities shall have adequate capacity to meet the
needs of the ships using them without causing undue delay.


Regulation 5

Noxious liquid substances in bulk

      The Contracting Parties shall as soon as possible, but not later
than 1 January 1977 or at a date not later than one year after the date
of the entry into force of the present Convention, whichever occurs
later, decide upon a date from which the provisions of Paragraphs A to
D of this Regulation on the discharge of noxious liquid substances in
bulk from ships while operating in Baltic Sea Area shall apply.

A. Definitions

      For the purpose of this Regulation:

1.    "Chemical tanker" means a ship constructed or adapted primarily
to carry a cargo of noxious liquid substances in bulk and includes an
"oil tanker" as defined in Regulation 4 of this Annex when carrying a
cargo or part cargo of noxious liquid substances in bulk.

2.    "Clean ballast" means ballast carried in a tank which, since it
was last used to carry a cargo containing a substance in Category A, 
B, C or D has been thoroughly cleaned and the residues resulting
therefrom have been discharged and the tank emptied in accordance with
the appropriate requirements of this Regulation.

3.    "Segregated ballast" means ballast water introduced into a tank
permanently allocated to the carriage of ballast or to the carriage of
ballast or cargoes other than oil or noxious liquid substances as
variously defined in the  Regulations of this Annex, and which is
completely separated from the cargo and oil fuel system.

4.    "Liquid substances" are those having a vapour pressure not
exceeding 2.8 kp/cm2 at a temperature of 37.80 C.

5.    "Noxious liquid substance" means any substance designated in
Appendix III to this Annex or provisionally assessed under the
provisions of Sub-Paragraph 4 of Paragraph B of this Regulation as
falling into Category A, B, C, or D.

B. Categorization and listing of noxious substances

1.    For the purposes of this Regulation noxious liquid substances
shall be divided into four categories as follows:

a)    Category A - noxious liquid substances which if discharged into
the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a
major hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause
serious harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and
therefore justify the application of stringent anti-pollution measures;

b)     Category B - noxious liquid substances which if discharged into
the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a 
hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause harm to
amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore justify the
application of special anti-pollution measures;

c)     Category C - noxious liquid substances which if discharged into
the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a 
minor hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause minor
harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore
require special operational conditions;

d)    Category D - noxious liquid substances which if discharged into
the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a 
recognizable hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause
minimal harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and
therefore require some attention in operational conditions;

2.    Guidelines for use in the categorization of noxious liquid
substances are given in Appendix II to this Annex. 

3.    The list of noxious liquid substances carried in bulk and
presently categorized which are subject to the provisions of this
Regulation is set out in Appendix II to this Annex.

4.    Where it is proposed to carry a liquid substance in bulk which
has not been categorized under Paragraph (i) of this Regulation or
evaluated as referred to in Regulation 4(1) of this Annex, the
Governments of Parties to the Convention involved in the proposed
operation shall establish and agree on a provisional assessment for the
proposed operation on the basis of the guidelines referred to in
Paragraph (2) of this Regulation.  Until full agreement between the
Governments involved has been reached, the substance shall be carried
under the most severe conditions proposed.  As soon as possible, but
not later than ninety days after its first carriage, the Administration
concerned shall notify the Organization and provide details of the
substance and the provisional assessment for prompt circulation to all
Parties for their information and consideration.  The Government of
each Party shall have a period of ninety days in which to forward its
comments to the Organization, with a view to the assessment of the
substance.

C. Other liquid substances

1.    The substances listed in Appendix III to this Annex have been
evaluated and found to fall outside the Categories A, B, C and D, as
defined in Regulation 3(1) of this Annex because they are presently
considered to present no harm to human health, marine resources,
amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea, when discharged into the
sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations.

2.    The discharge of bilge or ballast water or other residues or
mixtures containing only substances listed in Appendix III to this
Annex shall not be subject to any requirements of this Annex. 

3.    The discharge into the sea of clean ballast or segregated ballast
shall not be subject to any requirement of this Annex.

D. Discharge of noxious liquid substances

       Subject to the provisions of Regulation E of this Regulation:

1.     The discharge into the sea of substances in Category A as defined
in Regulation 3(1)(a) of this annex or of those provisionally assessed
as such or ballast water, tank washings, or other residues or mixtures
containing such substances shall be prohibited.  If tanks containing
such substances or mixtures are to be washed, the resulting residues
shall be discharged to a reception facility until the concentration of
the substance in the effluent to such facility is at or below the
residual concentration prescribed for that substance in column III of
Appendix II of this Annex and until the tank is empty.  Provided that
the residue then remaining in the tank is subsequently diluted by
the addition of a volume of water of not less than 5 per cent of the
total volume of  the  tank,  it  may  be discharged  into  the  sea 
when all the following conditions are also satisfied:

a)    the ship is proceeding en route at a speed of at least 7 knots
in the case of self-propelled ships or at least 4 knots in the case of
ships which are not self-propelled;

b)    the discharge is made below the waterline, taking into account
the location of the seawater intakes; and

c)    the discharge is made at a distance of not less than 12 nautical
miles from the nearest land and in a depth of water of not less than
25 metres.

2.    The discharge into the sea of substances in Category B as defined
in Sub-Paragraph 1 (b) of this Regulation or of those provisionally
assessed as such or ballast water, tank washings, or other residues or
mixtures containing such substances shall be prohibited except when all 
the following conditions are satisfied:

a)    the tank has been washed after unloading with a volume of water
of not less than 0.5 per cent of the total volume or the tank and the 
resulting residues have been discharged to a reception facility until
the tank is empty;

b)    the ship is proceeding en route at a speed of at least 7 knots
in the case of self-propelled ships or at least 4 knots in the case of 
ships which are not self-propelled;

c)    the procedures and arrangements for discharge and washings are
approved by the Administration and shall ensure that the concentration
and rate of discharge of the effluent is such that the concentration
of the substance in the wake astern if the ship does not exceed 1 part
per million;

d)    the discharge is made below the waterline, taking into account
the location of the seawater intakes; and

e)    the discharge is made at a distance of not less than 12 nautical
miles from the nearest land and in a depth of water of not less than
24 metres.

3.    The discharge into the sea of substances in Category C as defined
in Sub-Paragraphs 1 (c) of Paragraph B of this Regulation or of those 
provisionally assessed as such or ballast water, or mixtures containing
such substances shall be prohibited except when all the following
conditions are satisfied:

a)    the ship is proceeding en route at a speed of at least 7 knots
in the case of self-propelled ships or at least 4 knots in the  case
of ships which are not self-propelled;

b)    the procedures and arrangements for discharge are approved by the
Administration and shall ensure that the concentration and rate of
discharge of the effluent is such that the concentration of the
substance in the wake astern of the ship does not exceed 1 part per
million;

c)    the maximum quantity of cargo discharged from each tank and its
associated piping system does not exceed the maximum quantity approved
in accordance with the procedures referred to in Sub-Paragraph 3 (b)
of this Paragraph which shall in no case exceed the greater of 1 cubic
metre or 1/3,000 of the tank capacity in cubic metres,

4.    The discharge into the sea of substances in Category D as defined
in Regulation 3 (1) (d) of this Annex, or of those provisionally
assessed as such or ballast water, tank washings, or other residues or
mixtures containing such substances shall be prohibited except when all
the following conditions are satisfied:

a)    the ship is proceeding en route at a speed of at least 7 knots
in the case of self-propelled ships or at least 4 knots in the case of
ships which are not self-propelled;

b)    such mixtures are of a concentration not greater than one part
of the substance in ten parts of water; and

c)    the discharge is made at a distance of not less than 12 nautical
miles from the nearest land. 

5.    Ventilation procedures approved by the Administration may be used
to remove cargo residues from a tank. Such procedures shall be based
upon standards developed by the Organization.  If subsequent washing
of the tank is necessary, the discharge into the sea of the resulting
tank washings shall be made in accordance with Paragraphs (1), (2), (3)
or (4) of this Regulation, whichever is applicable.

6.    The discharge into the sea of substances which have not been
categorized, provisionally assessed, or evaluated as referred to in
Regulation 4 (1) of this Annex, or of ballast water, tank washings, or
other residues or mixtures containing such substances shall be
prohibited.

E. Exceptions

Paragraph D of this Regulation shall not apply to:

a)    the discharge into the sea of noxious liquid substances or
mixtures containing such substances necessary for the purpose of
securing the safety of a ship or saving life at sea; or 

b)    the discharge into the sea of noxious liquid substances or
mixtures containing such substances resulting from damage to a ship or
its equipment.

      (i)  provided that all reasonable precautions have been taken
           after the occurrence of the damage or discovery of the
           discharge for the purpose of preventing or minimizing the
                                discharge; and 

      (ii) except if the owner or the Master acted with intent to
           cause damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that damage
           would probably result; or 

c)    the discharge into the sea of noxious liquid substances or
mixtures containing such substances, approved by the Administration,
when being used for the purpose of combating specific position
incidents in order to minimize the damage from pollution.  Any such
discharge shall be subject to the approval of any Contracting Party in
whose jurisdiction it is contemplated the discharge will occur.

F. Measures of control

1.    The Contracting Parties shall appoint or authorize surveyors for
the purpose of implementing this Paragraph.
Category A Substances

2.    a) If a tank is partially unloaded or unloaded but not cleaned,
an appropriate entry shall be made in the Cargo Record Book:

operation carried out in connection with that tank shall also be
entered in the Cargo Record Book.

3.    If the tank is to be washed:

a)    the effluent from the tank washing operation shall be discharged
from the ship to a reception facility at least until the concentration
of the substance in the discharge, as indicated by analysis of samples
of the effluent taken by the surveyor has fallen to the residual
concentration specified for that substance in Appendix III to this
Annex.  When the required residual concentration has been achieved,
remaining tank washings shall continue to be discharged to the
reception facility until the tank is empty.  Appropriate entries of
these operations shall be made in the Cargo Record Book and certified
by the surveyor; and

b)    after diluting the residue then remaining in the tank with at
least 5 per cent of the tank capacity of water, this mixture may be
discharged into the sea in accordance with the provisions of Sub-

Appropriate entries of these operations shall be made in the Cargo
Record Book.

4.    Where the Government of the receiving Party is satisfied that it
is impracticable to measure the concentration of the substance in the
effluent without causing undue delay to the ship, that Party may accept
an alternative procedure as being equivalent to Sub-Paragraph 3 (a) of
this Paragraph provided that:

a)    a pre-cleaning procedure for that tank and that substance is
approved by the Administration and that Party is satisfied that such
procedure will fulfil the requirements of Sub-Paragraph 1 of Paragraph
D of this Regulation with respect to the attainment of the prescribed
residual concentrations;

b)    a surveyor duly authorized by that Party shall certify in the
Cargo Record Book that:

      (i)  the tank, its pump and piping system have been  emptied,
           and that the quantity of cargo remaining in the tank is at
           or below the quantity on which the approved pre-cleaning
           procedure referred to in Sub-Paragraph (ii) of this sub-
           Paragraph has been based;
