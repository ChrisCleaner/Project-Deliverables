EUROPEAN CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF PET ANIMALS

Adopted at Strasbourg on 13 November 1987


The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory 
hereto:

Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to 
achieve a greater unity between its Members,

Recognising that man has a moral obligation to respect all 
living creatures and bearing in mind that pet animals have a 
special relationship with man,

Considering the importance of pet animals in contributing 
to the quality of life and their consequent value to 
society,

Considering the difficulties arising from the enormous 
variety of animals which are kept by man,

Considering the risks which are inherent in pet animal 
overpopulation for the hygiene, health and safety of man and 
of other animals,

Considering that the keeping of specimens of wild fauna as 
pet animals should not be encouraged,

Aware of the different conditions which govern the 
acquisition, keeping, commercial and non-commercial breeding 
and the disposal of and trading in pet animals,

Aware that pet animals are not always kept in conditions 
that promote their health and well-being,

Noting that attitudes towards pet animals vary widely, 
sometimes because of limited knowledge and awareness,

Considering that a basic common standard of attitude and 
practice which results in responsible pet ownership is not 
only a desirable, but a realistic goal,

Have agreed as follows:

the minimum of physical and mental suffering appropriate to 
the animal;
