complained against is sufficient to remedy the pattern of non-enforcement
and

     (i)  if so, shall approve the plan, or

     (ii) if not, shall establish such a plan consistent with the law of
          the Party complained against, and

accordance with Annex 34,

as the disputing Parties may agree.

5.    Where a panel has been reconvened under paragraph 1(b), it shall
determine either that:

(a)  the party complained against is fully implementing the action plan,
in which case the panel may not impose a monetary enforcement assessment,
or

reconvened or such other period as the disputing Parties may agree.

Article 36: Suspension of Benefits

1.   Subject to Annex 36A, where a Party fails to pay a monetary
enforcement assessment within 180 days after it is imposed by a panel:

(a)  under Article 34(4)(b), or

(b)  under Article 34(5)(b), except where benefits may be suspended under
paragraph 2(a),

any complaining Party or Parties may suspend, in accordance with Annex
36B, the application to the Party complained against of NAFTA benefits
in an amount no greater than that sufficient to collect the monetary
enforcement assessment.

2.   Subject to Annex 36A, where a panel has made a determination under
Article 34(5)(b) and the panel:

(a)  has previously imposed a monetary enforcement assessment under
Article 34(4)(b) or established an action plan under Article 34(4)(a)
(ii); or

(b)  has subsequently determined under Article 35 that a Party is not
fully implementing an action plan;

the complaining Party or Parties may, in accordance with Annex 36B,
suspend annually the application to the Party complained against of NAFTA
benefits in an amount no greater than the monetary enforcement assessment
imposed by the panel under Article 34(5)(b).

3.    Where more than one complaining Party suspends benefits under
paragraph 1 or 2, the combined suspension shall be no greater than the
amount of the monetary enforcement assessment.

4.   Where a Party has suspended benefits under paragraph 1 or 2, the
Council shall, on the delivery of a written request by the Party
complained against to the other Parties and the Secretariat, reconvene
the panel to determine whether the monetary enforcement assessment has
been paid or collected, or whether the Party complained against is fully
implementing the action plan, as the case may be.  The panel shall submit
its report within 45 days after it has been reconvened.  If the panel
determines that the assessment has been paid or collected, or that the
Party complained against is fully implementing the action plan, the
suspension of benefits under paragraph 1 or 2, as the case may be, shall
be terminated.

5.   On the written request of the Party complained against, delivered
to the other Parties and the Secretariat, the Council shall reconvene the
panel to determine whether the suspension of benefits by the complaining
Party or Parties pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2 is manifestly excessive. 
Within 45 days of the request, the panel shall present a report to the
disputing Parties containing its determination.
