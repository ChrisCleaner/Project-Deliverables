CONVENTION ON CIVIL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM ACTIVITIES
DANGEROUS TO THE ENVIRONMENT

Adopted at Lugano on 21 June 1993


     The member States of the Council of Europe, the other States and
the European Economic Community signatory hereto,

     Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a
greater unity between its members;

     Noting that one of the objectives of the Council of Europe is to
contribute to the quality of life of human beings, in particular by
promoting a natural, healthy and agreeable environment;

     Considering the wish of the Council of Europe to co-operate with
other States in the field of nature conservation and protection of the
environment;

     Realising that man, the environment and property are exposed to
specific dangers caused by certain activities;

     Considering that emissions released in one country may cause
damage in another country and that, therefore, the problems of
adequate compensation for such damage are also of an international
nature;

     Having regard to the desirability of providing for strict
liability in this field taking into account the "Polluter Pays"
Principle;

     Mindful of the work which has already been carried out at an
international level, in particular to prevent damage and to deal with
damage caused by nuclear substances and the carriage of dangerous
goods;

     Having noted Principle 13 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on
Environment and Development, according to which "States shall develop
national law regarding liability and compensation for the victims of
pollution and other environmental damage; they shall also co-operate
in an expeditious and more determined manner to develop further
international law regarding liability and compensation for adverse
effects of environmental damage caused by activities within their
jurisdiction or control to areas beyond their jurisdiction";

     Recognising the need to adopt further measures to deal with grave
and imminent threats of damage from dangerous activities and to
facilitate the burden of proof for persons requesting compensation for
such damage,

     Have agreed as follows:


Chapter I - General provisions

Article 1 - Object and purpose

     This Convention aims at ensuring adequate compensation for damage
resulting from activities dangerous to the environment and also
provides for means of prevention and reinstatement.

Article 2 - Definitions

     For the purpose of this Convention:

1.   "Dangerous activity" means one or more of the following
activities provided that it is performed professionally, including
activities conducted by public authorities:

a)   the production, handling, storage, use or discharge of one or
more dangerous substances or any operation of a similar nature dealing
with such substances;

b)   the production, culturing, handling, storage, use, destruction,
disposal, release or any other operation dealing with one or more:

     -    genetically modified organisms which as a result of the
          properties of the organism, the genetic modification and the
          conditions under which the operation is exercised, pose a
          significant risk for man, the environment or property;

     -    micro-organisms which as a result of their properties and
          the conditions under which the operation is exercised pose a
          significant risk for man, the environment or property, such
          as those micro-organisms which are pathogenic or which
          produce toxins;

c)   the operation of an installation or site for the incineration,
treatment, handling or recycling of waste, such as those installations
or sites specified in Annex II, provided that the quantities involved
pose a significant risk for man, the environment or property;

d)   the operation of a site for the permanent deposit of waste.

2.   "Dangerous substance" means:

a)   substances or preparations which have properties which constitute
a significant risk for man, the environment or property. A substance
or preparation which is explosive, oxidizing, extremely flammable,
highly flammable, flammable, very toxic, toxic, harmful, corrosive,
irritant, sensitizing, carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic for reproduction
or dangerous for the environment within the meaning of Annex I, Part A
to this Convention shall in any event be deemed to constitute such a
risk;

b)   substances specified in Annex I, Part B to this Convention.
Without prejudice to the application of sub-paragraph a above, Annex
I, Part B may restrict the specification of dangerous substances to
certain quantities or concentrations, certain risks or certain
situations.

3.   "Genetically modified organism" means any organism in which the
genetic material has been altered in a way which does not occur
naturally by mating and/or natural recombination.

     However, the following genetically modified organisms are not
covered by the Convention:

     -    organisms obtained by mutagenesis on condition that the
          genetic modification does not involve the use of genetically
          modified organisms as recipient organisms; and

     -    plants obtained by cell fusion (including protoplast fusion)
          if the resulting plant can also be produced by traditional
          breeding methods and on condition that the genetic
          modification does not involve the use of genetically
          modified organisms as parental organisms.

     "Organism" refers to any biological entity capable of replication
or of transferring genetic material.

4.   "Micro-organism" means any microbiological entity, cellular or
non-cellular, capable of replication or of transferring genetic
material.

5.   "Operator" means the person who exercises the control of a
dangerous activity.

6.   "Person" means any individual or partnership or any body governed
by public or private law, whether corporate or not, including a State
or any of its constituent subdivisions.

7.   "Damage" means:

a)   loss of life or personal injury;

b)   loss of or damage to property other than to the installation
itself or property held under the control of the operator, at the site
of the dangerous activity;

c)   loss or damage by impairment of the environment in so far as this
is not considered to be damage within the meaning of sub-paragraphs a
or b above provided that compensation for impairment of the
environment, other than for loss of profit from such impairment, shall
be limited to the costs of measures of reinstatement actually
undertaken or to be undertaken;

d)   the costs of preventive measures and any loss or damage caused by
preventive measures,

to the extent that the loss or damage referred to in sub-paragraphs a
to c of this paragraph arises out of or results from the hazardous
properties of the dangerous substances, genetically modified organisms
or micro-organisms or arises or results from waste.

8.   "Measures of reinstatement" means any reasonable measures aiming
to reinstate or restore damaged or destroyed components of the
environment, or to introduce, where reasonable, the equivalent of
these components into the environment. Internal law may indicate who
will be entitled to take such measures.

9.   "Preventive measures" means any reasonable measures taken by any
person, after an incident has occurred to prevent or minimise loss or
damage as referred to in paragraph 7, sub-paragraphs a to c of this
Article.

10.  "Environment" includes:

     -    natural resources both abiotic and biotic, such as air,
          water, soil, fauna and flora and the interaction between the
          same factors;

     -    property which forms part of the cultural heritage; and

     -    the characteristic aspects of the landscape.

11.  "Incident" means any sudden occurrence or continuous occurrence
or any series of occurrences having the same origin, which causes
damage or creates a grave and imminent threat of causing damage.

Article 3 - Geographical scope

     Without prejudice to the provisions of Chapter III, this
Convention shall apply:

a)   when the incident occurs in the territory of a Party, as
determined in accordance with Article 34, regardless of where the
damage is suffered;

b)   when the incident occurs outside the territory referred to in
sub-paragraph a above and the conflict of laws rules lead to the
application of the law in force for the territory referred to in sub-
paragraph a above.

Article 4 - Exceptions

1.   This Convention shall not apply to damage arising from carriage;
carriage includes the period from the beginning of the process of
loading until the end of the process of unloading. However, the
Convention shall apply to carriage by pipeline, as well as to carriage
performed entirely in an installation or on a site unaccessible to the
public where it is accessory to other activities and is an integral
part thereof.

2.   This Convention shall not apply to damage caused by a nuclear
substance:

a)   arising from a nuclear incident the liability of which is
regulated either by the Paris Convention of 29 July 1960 on third
party liability in the field of nuclear energy, and its Additional
Protocol of 28 January 1964, or the Vienna Convention of 21 May 1963
on civil liability for nuclear damage; or

b)   if liability for such damage is regulated by a specific internal
law, provided that such law is as favourable, with regard to
compensation for damage, as any of the instruments referred to under
sub-paragraph a above.

3.   This Convention shall not apply to the extent that it is
incompatible with the rules of the applicable law relating to
workmen's compensation or social security schemes.

Chapter II - Liability

Article 5 - Transitional provisions

1.   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to incidents occurring
after the entry into force of the Convention in respect of a Party.
When the incident consists of a continuous occurrence or a series of
occurrences leaving the same origin and part of these occurrences took
place before the entry into force of this Convention, this chapter
shall only apply to damage caused by occurrences or part of a
continuous occurrence taking place after the entry into force.

2.   In respect of damage caused by waste deposited at a site for the
permanent deposit of waste the provisions of this chapter shall apply
to damage which becomes known after the entry into force of the
Convention in respect of the Party on the territory of which the site
is situated. However this chapter shall not apply if:

a)   the site was closed in accordance with the provisions of internal
law before the entry into force of the Convention;

b)   the operator proves, in the case where the operation of the site
continues after that entry into force of the Convention, that the
damage was caused solely by waste deposited there before that entry
into force.

Article 6 - Liability in respect of substances, organisms and certain
waste installations or sites

     The operator in respect of a dangerous activity mentioned under
Article 2, paragraph 1, subparagraphs a to c shall be liable for the
damage caused by the activity as a result of incidents at the time or
during the period when he was exercising the control of that activity.

2.   If an incident consists of a continuous occurrence, all operators
successively exercising the control of the dangerous activity during
that occurrence shall be jointly and severally liable. However, the
operator who proves that the occurrence during the period when he was
exercising the control of the dangerous activity caused only a part of
the damage shall be liable for that part of the damage only.

3.   If an incident consists of a series of occurrences having the
same origin, the operators at the time of any such occurrence shall be
jointly and severally liable. However, the operator who proves that
the occurrence at the time when he was exercising the control of the
dangerous activity caused only a part of the damage shall be liable
for that part of the damage only.

4.   If the damage resulting from a dangerous activity becomes known
after all such dangerous activity in the installation or on the site
has ceased, the last operator of this activity shall be liable for
that damage unless he or the person who suffered damage proves that
all or part of the damage resulted from an incident which occurred at
a time before he became the operator. If it is so proved, the
provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 of this Article shall apply.

5.   Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice any right of recourse
of the operator against any third party.

Article 7 - Liability in respect of sites for the permanent deposit of
waste

1.   The operator of a site for the permanent deposit of waste at the
time when damage caused by waste deposited at that site becomes known,
shall be liable for this damage. Should the damage caused by waste
deposited before the closure of such a site become known after that
closure, the last operator shall be liable.

2.   Liability under this Article shall apply to the exclusion of any
liability of the operator under Article 6, irrespective of the nature
of the waste.

3.   Liability under this Article shall apply to the exclusion of any
liability of the operator under Article 6 if the same operator
conducts another dangerous activity on the site for the permanent
deposit of waste.

     However, if this operator or the person who has suffered damage
proves that only a part of the damage was caused by the activity
concerning the permanent deposit of waste, this Article shall only
apply to that part of the damage.

4.   Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice any right of recourse
of the operator against any third party.

Article 8 - Exemptions

     The operator shall not be liable under this Convention for damage
which he proves:

a)   was caused by an act of war, hostilities, civil war, insurrection
or a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible
character;

b)   was caused by an act done with the intent to cause damage by a
third party, despite safety measures appropriate to the type of
dangerous activity in question;

c)   resulted necessarily from compliance with a specific order or
compulsory measure of a public authority;

d)   was caused by pollution at tolerable levels under local relevant
circumstances; or

e)   was caused by a dangerous activity taken lawfully in the
interests of the person who suffered the damage, whereby it was
reasonable towards this person to expose him to the risks of the
dangerous activity.

Article 9 - Fault of the person who suffered the damage

     If the person who suffered the damage or a person for whom he is
responsible under internal law, has, by his own fault, contributed to
the damage, the compensation may be reduced or disallowed leaving
regard to all the circumstances.

Article 10 - Causality

     When considering evidence of the causal link between the incident
and the damage or, in the context of a dangerous activity as defined
in Article 2, paragraph 1, sub-paragraph d, between the activity and
the damage, the court shall take due account of the increased danger
of causing such damage inherent in the dangerous activity.


Article 11 - Plurality of installations or sites

     When damage results from incidents which have occurred in several
installations or on several sites where dangerous activities are
conducted or from dangerous activities under Article 2, paragraph 1,
sub-paragraph d, the operators of the installations or sites concerned
shall be jointly and severally liable for all such damage. However,
the operator who proves that only part of the damage was caused by an
incident in the installation or on the site where he conducts the
dangerous activity or by a dangerous activity under Article 2,
paragraph 1, sub-paragraph d, shall be liable for that part of the
damage only.

Article 12 - Compulsory financial security scheme

     Each Party shall ensure that where appropriate, taking due
account of the risks of the activity, operators conducting a dangerous
activity on its territory be required to participate in a financial
security scheme or to have and maintain a financial guarantee up to a
certain limit, of such type and terms as specified by internal law, to
cover the liability under this Convention.

Chapter III - Access to information

Article 13 - Definition of public authorities

     For the purpose of this Chapter "public authorities" means any
public administration of a Party at national, regional or local level
with responsibilities, and possessing information relating to the
environment, with the exception of bodies acting in a judicial or
legislative capacity.

Article 14 - Access to information held by public authorities

1.   Any person shall, at his request and without his having to prove
an interest, have access to information relating to the environment
held by public authorities.

     The Parties shall define the practical arrangements under which
such information is effectively made available.

2.   The right of access may be restricted under internal law where it
affects:

 -   the confidentiality of the proceedings of public authorities,
     international relations and national defence;

 -   public security;

 -   matters which are or have been sub judice, or under enquiry
     (including disciplinary enquiries), or which are the subject of
     preliminary investigation proceedings;

 -   commercial and industrial confidentiality, including intellectual
     property;

 -   the confidentiality of personal data and/or files;

 -   material supplied by a third party without that party being under
     a legal obligation to do so;
or

 -   material, the disclosure of which would make it more likely that
     the environment to which that material related would be damaged.

     Information held by public authorities shall be supplied in part
where it is possible to separate out information on items concerning
the interests referred to above.

3.   A request for information may be refused where it would involve
the supply of unfinished documents or data or internal communications,
or where the request is manifestly unreasonable or formulated in too
general a manner.

4.   A public authority shall respond to a person requesting
information as soon as possible and at the latest within two months.
The reasons for a refusal to provide the information requested must be
given.

5.   A person who considers that his request for information has been
unreasonably refused or ignored, or has been inadequately answered by
a public authority, may seek a judicial or administrative review of
the decision, in accordance with the relevant internal legal system.

6.   The Parties may make a charge for supplying the information, but
such a charge may not exceed a reasonable cost.

Article 15 - Access to information held by bodies with public
responsibilities for the environment

     On the same terms and conditions as those set out in Article 14
any person shall have access to information relating to the
environment held by bodies with public responsibilities for the
environment and under the control of a public authority. Access shall
be given via the competent public administration or directly by the
bodies themselves.

Article 16 - Access to specific information held by operators

1.   The person who suffered the damage may, at any time, request the
court to order an operator to provide him with specific information,
in so far as this is necessary to establish the existence of a claim
for compensation under this Convention.

2.   Where, under this Convention, a claim for compensation is made to
an operator, whether or not in the framework of judicial proceedings,
this operator may request the court to order another operator to
provide him with specific information, in so far as this is necessary
to establish the extent of his possible obligation to compensate the
person who has suffered the damage, or of his own right to
compensation from the other operator.

3.   The operator shall be required to provide information under
paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article concerning the elements which are
available to him and dealing essentially with the particulars of the
equipment, the machinery used, the kind and concentration of the
dangerous substances or waste as well as the nature of genetically
modified organisms or micro-organisms.

4.   These measures shall not affect measures of investigation which
may legally be ordered under internal law.

5.   The court may refuse a request which places a disproportionate
burden on the operator, taking into account all the interests
involved.

6.   In addition to the restrictions under Article 14, paragraph 2 of
this Convention, which shall apply mutatis mutandis, the operator may
refuse to provide information where such information would incriminate
him.

7.   Any reasonable charge shall be paid by the person requesting the
information. The operator may require an appropriate guarantee for
such payment. However a court, when allowing a claim for compensation,
may establish that this charge shall be home by the operator, except
to the extent that the request resulted in unnecessary costs.

Chapter IV - Actions for compensation and other claims

Article 17 - Limitation periods

1.   Actions for compensation under this Convention shall be subject
to a limitation period of three years from the date on which the
claimant knew or ought reasonably to have known of the damage and of
the identity of the operator. The laws of the Parties regulating
suspension or interruption of limitation periods shall apply to the
limitation period prescribed in this paragraph.

2.   However, in no case shall actions be brought after thirty years
from the date of the incident which caused the damage. Where the
incident consists of a continuous occurrence the thirty years' period
shall run from the end of that occurrence. Where the incident consists
of a series of occurrences having the same origin the thirty years'
period shall run from the date of the last of such occurrences. In
respect of a site for the permanent deposit of waste the thirty years'
period shall at the latest run from the date on which the site was
closed in accordance with the provisions of internal law.

Article 18 - Requests by organisations

1.   Any association or foundation which according to its statutes
aims at the protection of the environment and which complies with any
further conditions of internal law of the Party where the request is
submitted may, at any time, request:

a)   the prohibition of a dangerous activity which is unlawful and
poses a grave threat of damage to the environment;

b)   that the operator be ordered to take measures to prevent an
incident or damage;

c)   that the operator be ordered to take measures, after an incident,
to prevent damage; or

d)   that the operator be ordered to take measures of reinstatement.

2.   Internal law may stipulate cases where the request is
inadmissible.

3.   Internal law may specify the body, whether administrative or
judicial, before which the request referred to in paragraph 1 above
should be made. In all cases provision shall be made for a right of
review.

4.   Before deciding upon a request mentioned under paragraph 1 above
the requested body may, in view of the general interests involved,
hear the competent public authorities.

5.   When the internal law of a Party requires that the association or
foundation has its registered seat or the effective centre of its
activities in its territory, the Party may declare at any time, by
means of a notification addressed to the Secretary General of the
Council of Europe, that, on the basis of reciprocity, an association
or foundation having its seat or centre of activities in the territory
of another Party and complying in that other Party with the other
conditions mentioned in paragraph 1 above shall have the right to
submit requests in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 3 above. The
declaration will become effective on the first day of the month
following the expiration of a period of three months after the date of
its reception by the Secretary General.

Article 19 - Jurisdiction

1.   Actions for compensation under this Convention may only be
brought within a Party at the court of the place:

a)   where the damage was suffered;

b)   where the dangerous activity was conducted; or

c)   where the defendant has his habitual residence.

2.   Requests for access to specific information held by operators
under Article 16, paragraphs 1 and 2 may only be submitted within a
Party at the court of the place:

a)   where the dangerous activity is conducted; or

b)   where the operator who may be required to provide the information
has his habitual residence.

3.   Requests by organisations under Article 18, paragraph 1, sub-
paragraph a may only be submitted within a Party at the court or, if
internal law so provides, at a competent administrative authority of
the place where the dangerous activity is or will be conducted.

4.   Requests by organisations under Article 18, paragraph 1, sub-
paragraphs b, c and d may only be submitted within a Party at the
court or, if internal law so provides, at a competent administrative
authority:

a)   of the place where the dangerous activity is or will be
conducted; or

b)   of the place where the measures are to be taken.

Article 20 - Notification

     The court shall stay the proceedings so long as it is not shown
that the defendant has been able to receive the document instituting
the proceedings or an equivalent document in sufficient time to enable
him to arrange for his defence, or that all necessary steps have been
taken to this end.

Article 21 - Lis pendens

1.   Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between
the same parties are brought in the courts of different Parties, any
court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay
its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first
seised is established.

2.   Where the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established,
any court other than the court first seised shall decline jurisdiction
in favour of that court.

Article 22 - Related actions

1.   Where related actions are brought in the courts of different
Parties, any court other than the court first seised may, while the
actions are pending at first instance, stay its proceedings.

2.   A court other than the court first seised may also, on the
application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the law of
that court permits the consolidation of related actions and the court
first seised has jurisdiction over both actions.

3.   For the purposes of this Article, actions are deemed to be
related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to
hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable
judgments resulting from separate proceedings.

Article 23 - Recognition and enforcement

     Any decision given by a court with jurisdiction in accordance
with Article 19 above where it is no longer subject to ordinary forms
of review, shall be recognised in any Party, unless:

a)   such recognition is contrary to public policy in the Party in
which recognition is sought;

b)   it was given in default of appearance and the defendant was not
duly served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with
an equivalent document in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for
his defence;

c)   the decision is irreconcilable with a decision given in a dispute
between the same parties in the Party in which recognition is sought;
or

d)   the decision is irreconcilable with an earlier decision given in
another State involving the same cause of action and between the same
parties, provided that this latter decision fulfils the conditions
necessary for its recognition in the Party addressed.

2.   A decision recognised under paragraph 1 above which is
enforceable in the Party of origin shall be enforceable in each Party
as soon as the formalities required by that Party have been completed.
The formalities shall not permit the merits of the case to be re-
opened.

Article 24 - Other treaties relating to jurisdiction, recognition and
enforcement

     Whenever two or more Parties are bound by a treaty establishing
rules of jurisdiction or providing for recognition and enforcement in
a Party of decisions given in another Party, the provisions of that
treaty shall replace the corresponding provisions of Articles 19 to
23.

Chapter V - Relation between this Convention and other provisions

Article 25 - Relation between this Convention and other provisions

1.   Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as limiting or
derogating from any of the rights of the persons who have suffered the
damage or as limiting the provisions concerning the protection or
reinstatement of the environment which may be provided under the laws
of any Party or under any other treaty to which it is a Party.

2.   In their mutual relations, Parties which are members of the
European Economic Community shall apply Community rules and shall
therefore not apply the rules arising from this Convention except in
so far as there is no Community rule governing the particular subject
concerned.

Chapter VI - The Standing Committee

Article 26 - The Standing Committee

1.   For the purposes of this Convention, a Standing Committee is
hereby set up.

2.   Each Party may be represented on the Standing Committee by one or
more delegates.

its competence the European Economic Community shall exercise its
right to vote in the Standing Committee with a number of votes equal
to the number of its member States which are Parties to this
Convention. It shall not exercise its right to vote in cases where the
member States exercise theirs and conversely. As long as no member
State of the European Economic Community is a Party, the Community as
a Party shall have one vote.

4.   Any State referred to in Article 32 or invited to accede to the
Convention in accordance with the provisions of Article 33 which is
not a Party to this Convention may be represented on the Standing
Committee by an observer. If the European Economic Community is not a
Party it may be represented on the Standing Committee by an observer.

5.   Unless, at least one month before the meeting, a Party has
informed the Secretary General of its objection, the Standing
Committee may invite the following to attend as observers at all its
meetings or one or part of a meeting:

 -   any State not referred to in paragraph 4 above;

 -   any international or national, governmental or non-governmental
     body technically qualified in the fields covered by this
     Convention.

6.   The Standing Committee may seek the advice of experts in order to
discharge its functions.

7.   The Standing Committee shall be convened by the Secretary General
of the Council of Europe. It shall meet whenever one-third of the
Parties or the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe so
request.

8.   One-third of the Parties shall constitute a quorum for holding a
meeting of the Standing Committee.

9.   Decisions may only be taken in the Standing Committee if at least
one-half of the Parties are present.

10.  Subject to Articles 27 and 29 to 31 the decisions of the Standing
Committee shall be taken by a majority of the members present.

11.  Subject to the provisions of this Convention the Standing
Committee shall draw up its own rules of procedure.

Article 27 - Functions of the Standing Committee

     The Standing Committee shall keep under review problems relating
to this Convention. It may, in particular:

concerning interpretation or implementation of the Convention. The
Standing Committee's conclusions concerning implementation of the
Convention may take the form of a recommendation; recommendations
shall be adopted by a three-quarters majority of the votes cast;

b)   propose any necessary amendments to the Convention including its
Annexes and examine those proposed in accordance with Articles 29 to
31.

Article 28 - Reports of the Standing Committee

     After each meeting, the Standing Committee shall forward to the
Parties and the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe a
report on its discussions and any decisions taken.

Chapter VII - Amendments to the Convention

Article 29 - Amendments to the Articles

1.   Any amendment to the Articles of this Convention proposed by a
Party or the Standing Committee shall be communicated to the Secretary
General of the Council of Europe and forwarded by him at least two
months before the meeting of the Standing Committee to the member
States of the Council of Europe, to the European Economic Community,
to any Signatory, to any Party, to any State invited to sign this
Convention in accordance with the provisions of Article 32 and to any
State invited to accede to it in accordance with the provisions of
Article 33.

by a three-quarters majority of the votes cast to the Parties for
acceptance;

b)   for amendments to Articles 26 to 37 shall submit the text adopted
by a three-quarters majority of the votes cast to the Committee of
Ministers for approval. After its approval, this text shall be
forwarded to the Parties for acceptance.

3.   Any amendment to Articles 1 to 25 shall enter into force, in
respect of those Parties which have accepted it, on the first day of
the month following the expiration of a period of one month after the
date on which three Parties, including at least two member states of
the Council of Europe, have informed the Secretary General that they
have accepted it.

     In respect of any Party which subsequently accepts it, the
amendment shall enter into force on the first day of the month
