BENELUX CONVENTION CONCERNING HUNTING AND THE PROTECTION OF BIRDS 

Adopted at Brussels on 10 June 1970


      The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Government of the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Government of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands,

      Having regard to article 6 of the Treaty instituting the Benelux
Economic Union, signed at The Hague on 3 February 1958,

      Having regard to the International Convention for the protection of
birds, signed at Paris on 18 October 1950, to which the three Benelux
countries are parties;

      Being desirous of harmonizing the principles governing their laws
and regulations on the subject of hunting and the protection of birds in
the wild state, which were established in the interests of land-holders,
agriculture and the efficient protection of nature;

      Considering that such harmonization will make for greater uniformity
in the laws relating to the transport of game and birds in the wild state
and thereby facilitate the elimination of formalities and inspection
measures at the frontiers between the Benelux countries;

      Having regard to the advice of the Benelux Consultative Inter-
parliamentary Council of 25 April 1970;

      Have agreed on the following provisions:
