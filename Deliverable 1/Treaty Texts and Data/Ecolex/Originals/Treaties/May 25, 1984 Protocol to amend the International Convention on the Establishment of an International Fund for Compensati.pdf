Protocol to Amend the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for  
Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 

(London, 25 May 1984) 

The States Parties to the present Protocol, 

Considering that it is desirable to amend the  
International Convention on the Establishment of an  
International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution  
Damage, done at Brussels on 18 December 1971, to provide  
for improved scope and enhanced compensation, 

Recognizing the advantage for the States Parties of  
arranging for the amended Convention to coexist with and  
be supplementary to the original Convention for a  
transitional period, 

Convinced that the economic consequences of pollution  
damage resulting from the carriage of oil in bulk at sea  
by ships should continue to be shared by the shipping  
industry and by the oil cargo interests, 

Bearing in mind the adoption of the Protocol of 1984 to  
amend the International Convention on Civil Liability for  
Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, 

Have agreed as follows: 


Article I 

The Convention which the provisions of this Protocol  
amend is the International Convention on the  
Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation  
for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971, hereinafter referred to  
as the "1971 Fund Convention". For States Parties to the  
Protocol of 1976 to the 1971 Fund Convention, such

Convention as amended by that Protocol.

follows: 

1 bis. "1971 Fund Convention" means the International  
Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund  
for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971. For  
States Parties to the Protocol of 1976 to that  
Convention, the term shall be deemed to include the 1971  
Fund Convention as amended by that Protocol. 

3. Paragraph 2 is replaced by the following text:

person, the Fund may be exonerated wholly or partially  
from its obligation to pay compensation to such person.  
The Fund shall in any event be exonerated to the extent  
that the shipowner may have been exonerated under Article

converted into national currency on the basis of the  
value of that currency by reference to the Special  
Drawing Right on the date of the decision of the Assembly  
of the Fund as to the first date of payment of  
compensation. 

4. Paragraph 5 is replaced by the following text:

shall be the same for all claimants. 

5. Paragraph 6 is replaced by the following text:

It shall also take into account the relationship between  
the limits in Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Convention  
as amended by this Protocol and those in Article V,  
paragraph 1 of the International Convention on Civil  
Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1984. 

6. (a) No amendment of the limits under this Article may  
be considered less than five years from the date on which  
this Protocol was opened for signature nor less than five  
years from the date of entry into force of a previous  
amendment under this Article. No amendment under this  
Article shall be considered before this Protocol has  
entered into force. 

(b) No limit may be increased so as to exceed an amount  
which corresponds to the limit laid down in the  
Convention as amendment by this Protocol increased by six  
per cent per year calculated on a compound basis from the  
date on which this Protocol was opened for signature. 

(c) No limit may be increased so as to exceed an amount  
which corresponds to the limit laid down in the  
Convention as amended by this Protocol multiplied by  
three. 

7. Any amendment adopted in accordance with paragraph 4  
shall be notified by the Organization to all Contracting  
States. The amendment shall be deemed to have been  
accepted at the end of a period of eighteen months after  
the date of notification unless within that period not  
less than one-quarter of the States that were Contracting  
States at the time of the adoption of the amendment by  
the Committee have communicated to the Organization that  
they do not accept the amendment in which case the  
amendment is rejected and shall have no effect. 

8. An amendment deemed to have been accepted in  
accordance with paragraph 7 shall enter into force  
eighteen months after its acceptance. 

9. All Contracting States shall be bound by the  
amendment, unless they denounce this Protocol in  
accordance with Article 34, paragraphs 1 and 2, at least  
six months before the amendment enters into force. Such  
denunciation shall take effect when the amendment enters  
into force. 

10. When an amendment has been adopted by the Committee  
but the eighteen-month period for its acceptance has not  
yet expired, a State which becomes a Contracting State  
during that period shall be bound by the amendment if it  
enters into force. A State which becomes a Contracting  
State after that period shall be bound by an amendment  
which has been accepted in accordance with paragraph  
7. In the cases referred to in this paragraph, a State  
becomes bound by an amendment when that amendment enters  
into force, or when this Protocol enters into force for  
that State, if later.
