<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>PART 3
<p>&nbsp;SOVEREIGNTY AND JURISDICTION - RELATED MATTERS
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Article 5
<p>&nbsp;Existing petroleum permit</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Where prior to 16 September 1975 Australia has granted an exploration
permit for petroleum under Australian law in respect of a part of the seabed
over which it ceases by virtue of this Treaty to exercise sovereign rights,
and a permittee retains rights in respect of that permit immediately prior
to the entry into force of this Treaty, Papua New Guinea, upon application
by that permittee, shall offer to that permittee a petroleum prospecting
licence or licences under Papua New Guinea law in respect of the same part
of the seabed on terms that are not less favourable than those provided
under Papua New Guinea law to any other holder of a seabed petroleum prospecting
licence.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. An application for a licence under paragraph 1 of this Article shall
be made-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) in respect of a part of the seabed lying outside the Protected Zone,
within six months after the date of entry into force of this Treaty;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) in respect of a part of the seabed lying within the Protected Zone,
during the period referred to in Article 15 and any extension of that period
to which the Parties may agree.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 6
<p>&nbsp;Exploitation of certain seabed deposits</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>If any single accumulation of liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas, or
if any other mineral deposit beneath the seabed, extends across any line
defining the limits of seabed jurisdiction of the Parties, and if the part
of such accumulation or deposit that is situated on one side of such a
line is recoverable in fluid form wholly or in part from the other side,
the Parties shall consult with a view to reaching agreement on the manner
in which the accumulation or deposit may be most effectively exploited
and on the equitable sharing of the benefits from such exploitation.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 7
<p>&nbsp;Freedom of navigation and overflight</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. On and over the waters of the Protected Zone that lie-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) north of the line referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 4 of this
Treaty and seaward of the low water lines of the land territory of either
Party, and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) south of that line and beyond the outer limits of the territorial
sea,
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>each Party shall accord to the vessels and aircraft of the other Party,
subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the freedoms of navigation
and overflight associated with the operation of vessels and aircraft on
or over the high seas.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. Each Party shall take all necessary measures to ensure that, in the
exercise of the freedoms of navigation and overflight accorded to its vessels
and aircraft under paragraph 1 of this Article-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) those vessels observe generally accepted international regulations,
procedures and practices for safety at sea and for the prevention, reduction
and control of pollution from ships;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) those civil aircraft observe the Rules of the Air established by
the International Civil Aviation Organization as they apply to civil aircraft,
and State aircraft normally comply with such of those rules as relate to
safety and at all times operate with due regard for the safety of navigation;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) those vessels and aircraft north of the line referred to in paragraph
1 of Article 4 of this Treaty do not engage in the embarking or disembarking
of any commodity, currency or person contrary to the customs, fiscal, immigration
or sanitary laws and regulations of the other Party, provided that the
relevant laws and regulations of that Party do not have the practical effect
of denying, hampering or impairing the freedoms of navigation and overflight
accorded under paragraph 1 of this Article; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(d) those vessels and aircraft, north of the line referred to in paragraph
1 of Article 4 of this Treaty, do not act in a manner prejudicial to the
peace, good order or security of the other Party.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. Vessels of a Party engaged in the exploration or exploitation of
resources in an area of jurisdiction of the other Party shall remain subject
to the laws and regulations of the other Party made in the exercise of
its resources jurisdiction consistently with this Treaty and with international
law, including the provisions of those laws and regulations concerning
the boarding, inspection and apprehension of vessels.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. In those areas of the Protected Zone north of the line referred to
in paragraph 1 of Article 4 of this Treaty to which paragraph 1 of this
Article does not apply, civil aircraft of a Party engaged in scheduled
or non-scheduled air services shall have the right of overflight, and the
right to make stops for non-traffic purposes, without the need to obtain
prior permission from the other Party, subject to compliance with any applicable
laws or regulations made for the safety of air navigation.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5. In areas of the Protected Zone to which paragraph 1 of this Article
does not apply, the vessels of a Party shall enjoy the right of innocent
passage. There shall be no suspension of that right, and neither Party
shall adopt laws or regulations applying to those areas that might impede
or hamper the normal passage of vessels between two points both of which
are in the territory of one Party.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>6. In cases where the provisions of neither paragraph 1 nor paragraph
5 of this Article apply, a regime of passage over routes used for international
navigation in the area between the two countries, including the area known
as Torres Strait, shall apply in respect of vessels that is no more restrictive
of passage than the regime of transit passage through straits used for
international navigation described in Articles 34 to 44 inclusive of Document
A/Conf. 62/WP.10 of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the
Sea, provided that, before a Party adopts a law or regulation that might
impede or hamper the passage over those routes of vessels proceeding to
or from the territory of the other Party, it shall consult with the other
Party. If the provisions of those Articles are revised, are not included
in any Law of the Sea Convention or fail to become generally accepted principles
of international law, the Parties shall consult with a view to agreeing
upon another regime of passage that is in accordance with international
practice to replace the regime of passage applying under this paragraph.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>7. The rights of navigation and overflight provided for in this Article
are in addition to, and not in derogation of, rights of navigation and
overflight in the area concerned under other treaties or general principles
of international law.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 8

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>With a view to maintaining and improving the safety of navigation through
the waters in the area between the two countries, the Parties shall cooperate
and, with due regard to the technical and other means available to each
of them, shall, where appropriate and as may be agreed between them, provide
mutual assistance in the provision and maintenance of navigational aids
and in the preparation of charts and maps.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 9
<p>&nbsp;Wrecks</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Wrecks of vessels and aircraft which lie on, in or under the seabed
in an area of seabed jurisdiction of a Party shall be subject to the jurisdiction
of that Party.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. If a wreck of historical or special significance to a Party is located
or found in an area between the two countries under the jurisdiction of
the other Party, the Parties shall consult with a view to reaching agreement
on the action, if any, to be taken with respect to that wreck.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. The provisions of this Article shall be without prejudice to the
competence of the courts of a Party, for the purposes of the laws of that
Party, in relation to maritime causes of action in respect of wrecks coming
within the provisions of this Article.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. This Article shall not apply to any military vessel or aircraft of
either Party wrecked after the date of entry into force of this Treaty.

<p>Article 10
<p>&nbsp;Establishment and purposes of the Protected Zone</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. A Protected Zone in the Torres Strait is hereby established comprising
all the land, sea, airspace, seabed and subsoil within the area bounded
by the line described in Annex 9 to this Treaty. The line so described
is shown on the maps annexed to this Treaty as Annexes 6 and 7 and, in
part, on the map annexed to this Treaty as Annex 2.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. The Parties shall adopt and apply measures in relation to the Protected
Zone in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. The principal purpose of the Parties in establishing the Protected
Zone, and in determining its northern, southern, eastern and western boundaries,
is to acknowledge and protect the traditional way of life and livelihood
of the traditional inhabitants including their traditional fishing and
free movement.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. A further purpose of the Parties in establishing the Protected Zone
is to protect and preserve the marine environment and indigenous fauna
and flora in and in the vicinity of the Protected Zone.

<br>
<br>
<p>1. Subject to the other provisions of this Treaty, each Party shall
continue to permit free movement and the performance of lawful traditional
activities in and in the vicinity of the Protected Zone by the traditional
inhabitants of the other Party.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. Paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be interpreted as sanctioning
the expansion of traditional fishing by the traditional inhabitants of
one Party into areas outside the Protected Zone under the jurisdiction
of the other Party not traditionally fished by them prior to the date of
entry into force of this Treaty.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. The provisions of this Article and the other provisions of this Treaty
concerning traditional fishing are subject to Article 14 and paragraph
2 of Article 20 of this Treaty.

<br>
<center>
<p>Article 12

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Where the traditional inhabitants of one Party enjoy traditional customary
rights of access to and usage of areas of land, seabed, seas, estuaries
and coastal tidal areas that are in or in the vicinity of the Protected
Zone and that are under the jurisdiction of the other Party, and those
rights are acknowledged by the traditional inhabitants living in or in
proximity to those areas to be in accordance with local tradition, the
other Party shall permit the continued exercise of those rights on conditions
not less favourable than those applying to like rights of its own traditional
inhabitants.

<br>
<br>
<p>1. Each Party shall take legislative and other measures necessary to
protect and preserve the marine environment in and in the vicinity of the
Protected Zone. In formulating those measures each Party shall take into
account internationally agreed rules, standards and recommended practices
which have been adopted by diplomatic conferences or by relevant international
organisations.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. The measures that each Party shall take in accordance with paragraph
1 of this Article shall include measures for the prevention and control
of pollution or other damage to the marine environment from all sources
and activities under its jurisdiction or control and shall include, in
particular, measures to minimise to the fullest practicable extent-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) the release of toxic, harmful or noxious substances from land-based
sources, from rivers, from or through the atmosphere, or by dumping at
sea;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) pollution or other damage from vessels; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) pollution or other damage from installations and devices used in
the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the seabed
and subsoil thereof.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. The measures taken by each Party in accordance with paragraph 1 of
this Article shall be consistent with its obligations under international
law, including obligations not to prejudice the rights of foreign ships
and aircraft, and shall be subject to the provisions of Article 7 of this
Treaty.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. The Parties shall consult, at the request of either, for the purpose
of
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) harmonising their policies with respect to the measures that each
shall take pursuant to this Article; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) ensuring the effective and coordinated implementation of those measures.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5. If either Party has reasonable grounds for believing that any planned
activity under its jurisdiction or control may cause pollution or other
damage to the marine environment in or in the vicinity of the Protected
Zone, that Party shall, after due investigation, communicate to the other
Party its assessment of the potential impact of that activity on the marine
environment.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>6. If either Party has reasonable grounds for believing that any existing
or planned activity under the jurisdiction or control of the other Party
is causing or may cause pollution or other damage to the marine environment
in or in the vicinity of the Protected Zone, it may request consultations
with the other Party, and the Parties shall then consult as soon as possible
with a view to adopting measures to prevent or control any pollution or
other damage to that environment from that activity.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 14
<p>&nbsp;Protection of fauna and flora</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Each Party shall, in and in the vicinity of the Protected Zone, use
its best endeavours to-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) identify and protect species of indigenous fauna and flora that
are or may become threatened with extinction;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) prevent the introduction of species of fauna and flora that may
be harmful to indigenous fauna and flora; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) control noxious species of fauna and flora.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Treaty except paragraph
4 of this Article, a Party may implement within its area of jurisdiction
measures to protect species of indigenous fauna and flora which are or
may become threatened with extinction or which either Party has an obligation
to protect under international law.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. The Parties shall as appropriate and necessary exchange information
concerning species of indigenous fauna and flora that are or may become
threatened with extinction and shall consult, at the request of either
of them, for the purpose of-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) harmonising their policies with respect to the measures that each
may take to give effect to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) ensuring the effective and coordinated implementation of those measures.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. In giving effect to the provisions of this Article, each Party shall
use its best endeavours to minimise any restrictive effects on the traditional
activities of the traditional inhabitants.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 15
<p>&nbsp;Prohibition of mining and drilling of the seabed</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Neither Party shall undertake or permit within the Protected Zone mining
or drilling of the seabed or the subsoil thereof for the purpose of exploration
for or exploitation of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas or other mineral
resources during a period of ten years from the date of entry into force
of this Treaty. The Parties may agree to extend that period.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 16
<p>&nbsp;Immigration, customs, quarantine and health</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Except as otherwise provided in this Treaty, each Party shall apply
immigration, customs, quarantine and health procedures in such a way as
not to prevent or hinder free movement or the performance of traditional
activities in and in the vicinity of the Protected Zone by the traditional
inhabitants of the other Party.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. Each Party, in administering its laws and policies relating to the
entry and departure of persons and the importation and exportation of goods
into and from areas under its jurisdiction in and in the vicinity of the
Protected Zone, shall act in a spirit of mutual friendship and good neighbourliness,
bearing in mind relevant principles of international law and established
international practices and the importance of discouraging the occurrence,
under the guise of free movement or performance of traditional activities,
of illegal entry, evasion of justice and practices prejudicial to effective
immigration, customs, health and quarantine protection and control.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) traditional inhabitants of one Party who wish to enter the other
country, except for temporary stay for the performance of traditional activities,
shall be subject to the same immigration, customs, health and quarantine
requirements and procedures as citizens of that Party who are not traditional
inhabitants;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) each Party reserves its right to limit free movement to the extent
necessary to control abuses involving illegal entry or evasion of justice;
and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) each Party reserves its right to apply such immigration, customs,
health and quarantine measures, temporary or otherwise, as it considers
necessary to meet problems which may arise. In particular each Party may
apply measures to limit or prevent free movement, or the carriage of goods,
plants or animals in the course thereof, in the case of an outbreak or
spread of an epidemic, epizootic or epiphytotic in or in the vicinity of
the Protected Zone.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 17
<p>&nbsp;Implementation and coordination</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>In order to facilitate the implementation of the provisions of this
Treaty relating to the Protected Zone, the authorities of each Party shall,
at the request of the authorities of the other Party, as may be appropriate
and necessary-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) make available to the authorities of the other Party information
on the relevant provisions of its laws, regulations and procedures relating
to immigration, citizenship, customs, health, quarantine, fisheries, the
protection of the environment and other matters; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) consult with the authorities of the other Party with a view to making
appropriate administrative or other arrangements to resolve any problems
arising in the implementation of those provisions.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 18
<p>&nbsp;Liaison arrangements</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Each Party shall designate a representative who shall facilitate
the implementation at the local level of the provisions of this Treaty.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. The two designated representatives shall-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) exchange information on relevant developments in and in the vicinity
of the Protected Zone;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) consult together and take such action as is appropriate to their
respective functions to facilitate the practical operation at the local
level of the provisions of this Treaty and to resolve any problems arising
therefrom;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) keep under review free movement by the traditional inhabitants of
one Party into areas under the jurisdiction of the other Party and the
local arrangements applying in respect of such free movement; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(d) draw to the attention of their Governments, and make recommendations
as appropriate on, any matters affecting the implementation of the provisions
of this Treaty or arising therefrom which are not capable of resolution
at the local level or which may otherwise require consideration by both
Parties.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. In the exercise of his functions, each representative shall-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) consult closely with representatives of the traditional inhabitants
of his country, particularly in relation to any problems which may arise
in respect of free movement, traditional activities and the exercise of
traditional customary rights as provided for in this Treaty, and convey
their views to his Government; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) maintain close liaison with national, State, Provincial and local
authorities of his country on all matters falling within their respective
responsibilities.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. Unless a different location is required by the circumstances, the
representative of Australia shall be based at Thursday Island and the representative
of Papua New Guinea shall be based at Daru.

<br>
<center>
<p>Article 19
<p>&nbsp;Torres Strait Joint Advisory Council</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. The Parties shall jointly establish and maintain an advisory and
consultative body which shall be known as the Torres Strait Joint Advisory
Council (called in this Article "the Advisory Council").
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. The functions of the Advisory Council shall be-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) to seek solutions to problems arising at the local level and not
resolved pursuant to Article 18 of this Treaty;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) to consider and to make recommendations to the Parties on any developments
or proposals which might affect the protection of the traditional way of
life and livelihood of the traditional inhabitants, their free movement,
performance of traditional activities and exercise of traditional customary
rights as provided for in this Treaty; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) to review from time to time as necessary, and to report and to make
recommendations to the Parties on, any matters relevant to the effective
implementation of this Treaty, including the provisions relating to the
protection and preservation of the marine environment, and fauna and flora,
in and in the vicinity of the Protected Zone.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. The Advisory Council shall not have or assume responsibilities for
management or administration. These responsibilities shall, within the
respective areas of jurisdiction of each Party, continue to lie with the
relevant national, State, Provincial and local authorities.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. In the exercise of its functions, the Advisory Council shall ensure
that the traditional inhabitants are consulted, that they are given full
and timely opportunity to comment on matters of concern to them and that
their views are conveyed to the Parties in any reports and recommendations
made by the Advisory Council to the Parties.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5. The Advisory Council shall transmit its reports and recommendations
to the Foreign Ministers of the Parties. After consideration by appropriate
authorities of the Parties, consultations may be arranged with a view to
the resolution of matters to which the Advisory Council has invited attention.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>6. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Advisory Council shall
consist of eighteen members, that is nine members from each Party who shall
include-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) at least two national representatives;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) at least one member representing the Government of Queensland in

in the case of Papua New Guinea; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) at least three members representing the traditional inhabitants,
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>with each Party being free to decide from time to time from which of
the aforementioned categories any other of its members will be drawn.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>7. The Advisory Council shall meet when necessary at the request of
either Party. Consecutive meetings of the Advisory Council shall be chaired
alternately by a representative of Australia and a representative of Papua
New Guinea. Meetings shall be held alternately in Australia and Papua New
Guinea or as may from time to time be otherwise arranged.

<p>PART 5
<p>&nbsp;PROTECTED ZONE COMMERCIAL FISHERIES
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Article 20
<p>&nbsp;Priority of traditional fishing and application of measures to
traditional fishing</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. The provisions of this Part shall be administered so as not to prejudice
the achievement of the purposes of Part 4 of this Treaty in regard to traditional
fishing.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. A Party may adopt a conservation measure consistent with the provisions
of this Part which, if necessary for the conservation of a species, may
be applied to traditional fishing, provided that that Party shall use its
best endeavours to minimise any restrictive effects of that measure on
traditional fishing.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 21
<p>&nbsp;Conservation, management and optimum utilisation</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Parties shall cooperate in the conservation, management and optimum
utilisation of Protected Zone commercial fisheries. To this end, the Parties
shall consult at the request of either and shall enter into arrangements
for the effective implementation of the provisions of this Part.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 22
<p>&nbsp;Conservation and management of individual fisheries</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. The Parties shall, where appropriate, negotiate subsidiary conservation
and management arrangements in respect of any individual Protected Zone
commercial fishery.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. If either party notifies the other in writing that it regards one
of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries as one to which common conservation
and management arrangements should apply, the Parties shall within ninety
days from the date of the notification enter into consultations with a
view to concluding arrangements specifying the measures to be applied by
them with respect to that fishery.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. The Parties shall, where appropriate, also negotiate supplementary
conservation and management arrangements in respect of resources directly
related to a fishery referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, including
resources involving stocks occurring in the Protected Zone where such stocks
are not otherwise subject to the provisions of this Treaty.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 23
<p>&nbsp;Sharing of the catch of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. The Parties shall share the allowable catch of the Protected Zone
commercial fisheries in accordance with the provisions of this Article
and of Articles 24 and 25 of this Treaty.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. The allowable catch, that is to say the optimum sustainable yield,
of a Protected Zone commercial fishery shall be determined jointly by the
Parties as part of the subsidiary conservation and management arrangements
referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. If either Party has reasonable grounds for believing that the commercial
exploitation of a species of Protected Zone commercial fisheries would,
or has the potential to, cause serious damage to the marine environment,
or might endanger another species, that Party may request consultations
with the other Party and the Parties shall then consult as soon as possible
with a view to reaching agreement on whether such commercial exploitation
could be undertaken in a manner which would not result in such damage or
endanger another species.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. In respect of any relevant period where the full allowable catch
of a particular Protected Zone commercial fishery might be taken, each
Party shall be entitled to a share of the allowable catch apportioned,
subject to paragraphs 5, 6 and 8 of this Article and to Articles 24 and
25 of this Treaty, as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) in areas under Australian jurisdiction, except as provided in (b)
below:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Australia - 75%
<p>&nbsp;Papua New Guinea - 25%
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) within the territorial seas of Anchor Cay, Black Rocks, Bramble
Cay, Deliverance Island, East Cay, Kerr Islet, Pearce Cay and Turu Cay:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Australia - 50%
<p>&nbsp;Papua New Guinea - 50%
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) in areas under Papua New Guinea jurisdiction:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Australia - 25%
<p>&nbsp;Papua New Guinea - 75%
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5. Papua New Guinea shall have the sole entitlement to the allowable
catch of the commercial barramundi fishery near the Papua New Guinea coast,
except within the territorial seas of the islands of Aubusi, Boigu, Dauan,
Kaumag, Moimi and Saibai where, in respect of that fishery, the provisions
of paragraph 4(a) of this Article shall not apply.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>6. In apportioning the allowable catch in relation to an individual
fishery, the Parties shall normally consider the allowable catch expressed
in terms of weight or volume. In calculating the apportionment of the total
allowable catch of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries, the Parties
shall have regard to the relative value of individual fisheries and shall,
for this purpose, agree on a common value for production from each individual
fishery for the period in question, such value being based on the value
of the raw product at the processing facility or such other point as may
be agreed, but prior to any enhancement of value through processing, including
processing at a pearl culture farm, or further transportation or marketing.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>7. The Parties may agree to vary the apportionment of the allowable
catch determined for individual fisheries as part of the subsidiary conservation
and management arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of
this Treaty but so as to maintain in respect of the total allowable catch
of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries the apportionment specified
in paragraph 4 of this Article for each Party.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>8. In calculating the total allowable catch of the Protected Zone commercial
fisheries, the allowable catch of the commercial barramundi fishery referred
to in paragraph 5 of this Article shall be disregarded.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 24
<p>&nbsp;Transitional entitlement</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. As part of the subsidiary conservation and management arrangements
referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty, the level of the
catch of each Protected Zone commercial fishery to which each Party is
entitled, provided it remains within the allowable catch-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) shall not, during the period of five years immediately after the
entry into force of this Treaty, be reduced below the level of catch of
that Party before the entry into force of this Treaty; but
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) may, during the second period of five years after the entry into
force of this Treaty, be adjusted progressively so that at the end of that
second five-year period it reaches the level of catch apportioned in each
case in Article 23 of this Treaty.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. The entitlement of a Party under this Article shall, where the limitation
of the allowable catch makes it necessary, take priority over the entitlement
of the other Party under Article 23 of this Treaty, but shall be taken
into account in calculating the entitlement of the first Party.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 25
<p>&nbsp;Preferential entitlement</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>If, in any relevant period, a Party does not itself propose to take
all the allowable catch of a Protected Zone commercial fishery to which
it is entitled, either in its own area of jurisdiction or that of the other
Party, the other Party shall have a preferential entitlement to any of
the allowable catch of that fishery not taken by the first Party.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 26
<p>&nbsp;Licensing arrangements</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. In the negotiation and implementation of the conservation and management
arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) the Parties shall consult and cooperate in the issue and endorsement
of licences to permit commercial fishing in Protected Zone commercial fisheries;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) the responsible authorities of the Parties may issue licences to
fish in any Protected Zone commercial fishery; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(c) persons or vessels which are licensed by the responsible authorities
of one Party to fish in any relevant period in a Protected Zone commercial
fishery shall, if nominated by the responsible authorities of that Party,
be authorised by the responsible authorities of the other Party, wherever
necessary, by the endorsement of licences or otherwise, to fish in those
areas under the jurisdiction of the other Party in which the fishery concerned
is located.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. The persons or vessels licensed by one Party which have been authorised,
or are to be authorised, under the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article
to fish in waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party shall comply
with the relevant fisheries laws and regulations of the other Party except
that they shall be exempt from licensing fees, levies and other charges
imposed by the other Party in respect of such fishing activities.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. In issuing licences in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article,
the responsible authorities of both Parties shall have regard to the desirability
of promoting economic development in the Torres Strait area and employment
opportunities for the traditional inhabitants.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. The responsible authorities of both Parties shall ensure that the
traditional inhabitants are consulted from time to time on the licensing
arrangements in respect of Protected Zone commercial fisheries.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 27
<p>&nbsp;Third State fishing in Protected Zone commercial fisheries</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. The responsible authorities of the Parties shall inform one another
and shall consult, at the request of either of them, concerning the proposed
exploitation of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) by a joint venture in which there is third-State equity participation;
or
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) by a vessel of third-State registration or with a crew substantially
of the nationality of a third State.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. Vessels the operations of which are under the control of nationals
of a third State shall not be licensed to exploit the Protected Zone commercial
fisheries without the concurrence of the responsible authorities of both
Parties in a particular case or class of cases.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p>Article 28
<p>&nbsp;Inspection and enforcement</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. The Parties shall cooperate, including by exchange of personnel,
in inspection and enforcement to prevent violations of the Protected Zone
commercial fisheries arrangements and in taking appropriate enforcement
measures in the event of such violations.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. The Parties shall consult from time to time, as necessary, so as
to ensure that legislation and regulations adopted by each Party pursuant
to paragraph 1 of this Article are, as far as practicable, consistent with
the legislation and regulations of the other Party.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. Each Party shall make it an offence under its fisheries laws or regulations
for a person to use a vessel of its nationality to fish in Protected Zone
commercial fisheries for species of fisheries resources in areas over which
the other Party has jurisdiction in respect of those species-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) without being duly licensed or authorised by that other Party; or
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) in the case of a licensed or authorised vessel, in breach of the
fisheries laws or regulations of the other Party applying within those
areas.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. Each Party will, in relation to species of fisheries resources in
areas where it has jurisdiction in respect of those species-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) investigate suspected offences against its fisheries laws and regulations;
and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) except as provided in or under this Article, take corrective action
when necessary against offenders against those laws or regulations.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5. In this Article, "corrective action" means the action normally taken
in respect of a suspected offence, after due investigation, and includes,
where appropriate, the apprehension of a suspected offender, the prosecution
of an alleged offender, or the execution of a penalty imposed by a court
or the cancellation or suspension of the licence of an offender.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>6. In accordance with the provisions of this Article, and in other appropriate
cases as may be agreed between the Parties, corrective action in respect
of offences or suspected offences against the fisheries laws or regulations
of the Parties shall be taken by the authorities of the Party whose nationality
is borne by the vessel or person concerned (called in this Article "the
first Party") and not by the Party in whose area of jurisdiction the offence
or suspected offence occurs (called in this Article "the second Party").
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>7. The Parties acknowledge that the principle stated in paragraph 6
of this Article should not be applied so as to frustrate the enforcement
of fisheries laws or regulations or to enable offenders against those laws
or regulations to go unpunished.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>8. Where, in the case of a suspected offence alleged to have been committed
in or in the vicinity of the Protected Zone, it appears that the offence
was, or might reasonably be considered to have been, committed in the course
of traditional fishing, corrective action or other measures shall be taken
by the authorities of the first Party and not by the authorities of the
second Party and, if being detained by the authorities of the second Party,
the alleged offenders and their vessel shall be either released or handed
over to the authorities of the first Party, in accordance with arrangements
that will avoid undue expense or inconvenience to the authorities of the
second Party.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>9. Where paragraph 8 of this Article applies, the authorities of the
second Party may require assurance in a particular case that corrective
action or other measures will be taken by the authorities of the first
Party that will adequately ensure that the activity complained of will
not be repeated.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>10. Where the provisions of paragraph 8 of this Article do not apply,
and the person or vessel alleged to have been involved or used in the commission
of a suspected offence in the Protected Zone is licensed to fish in the
Protected Zone by the authorities of the first Party, corrective action
shall be taken by the authorities of the first Party and not by the authorities
of the second Party and, if being detained by the authorities of the second
Party, the alleged offenders and their vessel shall be either released
or handed over to the authorities of the first Party, in accordance with
arrangements that will avoid undue expense or inconvenience to the authorities
of the second Party, and the provisions of paragraphs 13 and 14 of this
Article shall apply.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>11. The provisions of paragraph 10 of this Article shall also apply
in respect of a suspected offence by a person or vessel of the first Party
in an area of jurisdiction of the second Party outside the Protected Zone
where-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) that person or vessel was authorised by the authorities of the second
Party to fish in the area where the suspected offence was committed under
the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty;
and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) the suspected offence was committed in relation to the fishery the
subject of that authorisation and did not involve the taking of other species
or potential injury to another fishery.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>12. Persons or vessels of the first Party detained by the authorities
of the second Party in the circumstances described in paragraphs 8 and
10 of this Article may be detained for as long as necessary to enable those
authorities to conduct an expeditious investigation into the offence and
to obtain evidence. Thereafter, they shall not be detained other than for
the purpose of the handing over of the persons or vessels in accordance
with the provisions of those paragraphs unless they are lawfully detained
on some other ground.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>13. If an alleged offender referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article
is, in respect of conduct in waters under the jurisdiction of the second
Party-
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(a) convicted of an offence against the fisheries laws or regulations
of the first Party; or
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) found by the authorities of the first Party, on the basis of sufficient
available evidence, to have contravened or failed to comply with a condition
of his licence or authorisation or that of his vessel;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>the authorities of the first Party shall, where appropriate and having
regard to paragraph 7 of this Article, cancel or suspend the licence or
authorisation of the person or his vessel so far as it relates to the Protected
Zone commercial fisheries.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>14. Where a person or vessel involved or used in the commission of the
alleged offence referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article is also currently
licensed or authorised to fish in the area of the Protected Zone by the
second Party, the authorities of the second Party may, after receiving
a report and representations, if any, from the authorities of the first
Party, cancel or suspend that licence or authorisation in accordance with
its laws for such period as is warranted by the circumstances of the case.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>15. Each Party shall provide the other Party with any evidence obtained
during investigations carried out in accordance with this Article into
a suspected offence involving a person or vessel of the other Party. Each
Party shall take appropriate measures to facilitate the admission of such
evidence in proceedings taken in respect of the suspected offence.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>16. In this Article references to persons and vessels of, or of the
nationality of, a Party include references to persons or vessels licensed
by that Party under sub-paragraph 1(b) of Article 26 of this Treaty, and
the crews of vessels so licensed, except where such persons or vessels
have a prior current licence from the other Party under that sub-paragraph.
