CONVENTION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC SEALS

Adopted at London on 1 June 1972


   The Contracting Parties,

   Recalling the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of 
Antarctic Fauna and Flora adopted under the Antarctic Treaty 
signed at Washington on 1 December 1959:

   Recognizing the general concern about the vulnerability of 
Antarctic seals to commercial exploitation and the consequent need 
for effective conservation measures:

   Recognizing that the stocks of Antarctic seals are an 
important living resource in the marine environment which requires 
an international agreement for its effective conservation;

   Recognizing that this resource should not be depleted by 
over-exploitation, and hence that any harvesting should be 
regulated so as not to exceed the levels of the optimum 
sustainable yield;

   Recognizing that in order to improve scientific knowledge and 
so place exploitation on a rational basis, every effort should be 
made both to encourage biological and other research on Antarctic 
seal populations and to gain information from such research and 
from the statistics of future sealing operations, so that further 
suitable regulations may be formulated;

   Noting that the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research of 
the International Council of Scientific Unions (SCAR) is willing 
to carry out the tasks requested of it in this Convention.

   Desiring to promote and achieve the objectives of protection, 
scientific study and rational use of Antarctic seals, and to 
maintain a satisfactory balance within the ecological system,

   Have agreed as follows:

Parties.



Addendum

   At the signature, the following statement was made by the 
Representative of Chile:

   "The Delegation of Chile states that the reference to Article 
IV of the Antarctic Treaty contained in Article 1 of the present 
Convention signifies that nothing specified therein shall confirm, 
deny or impair the rights of the Contracting Parties as regards 
their maritime jurisdictions and their declared juridical position 
on this matter."

   The following statement was made by the Representative of the 
United States of America:

   "The Delegation of the United States of America believes that 
the Convention should contain stronger provisions for the 
observation of operations and enforcement of regulations, 
especially with regard to the use of observers of the Contracting 
Parties with each others' sealing expeditions. Opposition to 
stronger provisions has chiefly arisen not from commercial but 
from juridical interests.

   "Nevertheless, the Convention is a new and valuable 
International Agreement, achieved in advance of the development of 
commercial sealing in the Antarctic. that contains many provisions 
important to the conservation of seals and their protection 
against over-exploitation. We understand exploratory commercial 
sealing ventures may be imminent.

   "In order not to diminish the progress achieved by this 
Conference in international co-operation effective conservation in 
the Antarctic, the delegation of the United States of America has 
decided to sign the Final Act and will submit the Convention for 
its Government's consideration."
