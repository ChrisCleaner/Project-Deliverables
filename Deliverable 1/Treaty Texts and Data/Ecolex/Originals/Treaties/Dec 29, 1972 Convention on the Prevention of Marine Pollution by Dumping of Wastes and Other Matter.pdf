CONVENTION ON THE PREVENTION OF MARINE POLLUTION BY DUMPING OF
WASTES AND OTHER MATTER 

Adopted at London, Mexico City, Moscow, Washington on 29 December 1972


      The Contracting Parties to this Convention,

      Recognizing that the marine environment and the living
organisms which it supports are of vital importance to humanity, and
all people have an interest in assuring that it is so managed that
its quality and resources are not impaired;

      Recognizing that the capacity of the sea to assimilate wastes
and render them harmless, and its ability to regenerate natural
resources, is not unlimited;

      Recognizing that States have, in accordance with the Charter
of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the
sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own
environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that
activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage
to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of
national jurisdiction;

      Recalling Resolution 2749 (XXV) of the General Assembly of the
United Nations on the principles governing the sea-bed and the ocean
floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national
jurisdiction;

      Noting that marine pollution originates in many sources, such
as dumping and discharges through the atmosphere, rivers, estuaries,
outfalls and pipelines, and that it is important that States use the
best practicable means to prevent such pollution and develop
products and processes which will reduce the amount of harmful
wastes to be disposed of;

      Being convinced that international action to control the
pollution of the sea by dumping can and must be taken without delay
but that this action should not preclude discussion of measures to
control other sources of marine pollution as soon as possible; and

      Wishing to improve protection of the marine environment by
encouraging States with a common interest in particular geographical
areas to enter into appropriate agreements supplementary to this
Convention;

      Have agreed as follows:


Article I

      Contracting Parties shall individually and collectively
promote the effective control of all sources of pollution of the
marine environment, and pledge themselves especially to take all
practicable steps to prevent the pollution of the sea by the dumping
of waste and other matter that is liable to create hazards to human
health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage
amenities or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea.


Article II

      Contracting Parties shall, as provided for in the following
Articles, take effective measures individually, according to their
scientific, technical and economic capabilities, and collectively,
to prevent marine pollution caused by dumping and shall harmonize
their policies in this regard.


Article III

      For the purpose of this Convention:

1.    a) "Dumping" means:

      (i)  any deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter
           from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made
           structures at sea;

      (ii) any deliberate disposal at sea of vessels, aircraft,
           platforms or other man-made structures at sea.

b)    "Dumping" does not include:

      (i)  the disposal at sea of wastes or other matter incidental
           to, or derived from the normal operations of vessels,
           aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea
           and their equipment, other than wastes or other matter
           transported by or to vessels, aircraft, platforms or
           other man-made structures at sea, operating for the
           purpose of disposal of such matter or derived from the
           treatment of such wastes or other matter on such vessels,
           aircraft, platforms or structures;

      (ii) placement of matter for a purpose other than the mere
           disposal thereof, provided that such placement is not
           contrary to the aims of this Convention.

c)    The disposal of wastes or other matter directly arising from,
or related to the exploration, exploitation and associated off-shore
processing of sea-bed mineral resources will not be covered by the
provisions of this Convention.

2.    "Vessels and aircraft" means waterborne or airborne craft of
any type whatsoever. This expression includes air cushioned craft
and floating craft, whether self-propelled or not.

Article IV

1.    In accordance with the provisions of this Convention
Contracting Parties shall prohibit the dumping of any wastes or
other matter in whatever form or condition except as otherwise
specified below:

a)    the dumping of wastes or other matter listed in Annex I is
prohibited;

b)    the dumping of wastes or other material listed in Annex II
requires a prior special permit;

c)    the dumping of all other wastes or matter requires a prior
general permit.

2.    Any permit shall be issued only after careful consideration of
all the factors set forth in Annex III, including prior studies of
the characteristics of the dumping site as set forth in Sections B
and C of that Annex.

3.    No provision of this Convention is to be interpreted as
preventing a Contracting Party from prohibiting, insofar as that
Party is concerned, the dumping of wastes or other matter not
mentioned in Annex I. That Party shall notify such measures to the
Organisation.


Article V

1.    The provisions of Article IV shall not apply when it is
necessary to secure the safety of human life or of vessels,
aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea in cases of
force majeure caused by stress of weather, or in any case which
constitutes a danger to human life or a real threat to vessels,
aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea, if dumping
appears to be the only way of averting the threat and if there is
every probability that the damage consequent upon such dumping will
be less than would otherwise occur. Such dumping shall be so
conducted as to minimise the likelihood of damage to human or marine
life and shall be reported forthwith to the Organisation.

2.    A Contracting Party may issue a special permit as an exception
to Article IV ( 1 ) (a), in emergencies, posing unacceptable risk
relating to human health and admitting no other feasible solution.
Before doing so the Party shall consult any other country or
countries that are likely to be affected and the Organisation which,
after consulting other Parties, and international organisations as
appropriate, shall in accordance with Article XIV promptly recommend
to the party the most appropriate procedures to adopt. The Party
shall follow these recommendations to the maximum extent feasible
consistent with the time within which action must be taken and with
the general obligation to avoid damage to the marine environment and
shall inform the Organisation of the action it takes. The Parties
pledge themselves to assist one another in such situations.

marketability of resources (fish shellfish. etc.).

B.    Characteristics of dumping site and method of deposit

1.    Location (e.g. co-ordinates of the dumping area, depth and
distance from the coast), location in relation to other areas (e.g.
amenity areas spawning, nursery and fishing areas and exploitable
resources).

2     Rate of disposal per specific period (e.g. quantity per day,
per week, per month).

3.    Methods of packaging and containment, if any.

4.    Initial dilution achieved by proposed method of release.

5.    Dispersal characteristics (e.g. effects of currents, tides and
wind on horizontal transport and vertical mixing).
6.    Water characteristics (e.g. temperature. pH, salinity
stratification, oxygen indices of pollution -  dissolved oxygen
(DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
- nitrogen present in organic and mineral form including ammonia,

consider whether an adequate scientific basis exists for assessing
the consequences of such dumping, as outlined in this Annex, taking
into account seasonal variations.

C.    General considerations and conditions

1.    Possible effects on amenities (e.g. presence of floating or
stranded material, turbidity, objectionable odour, discolouration
and foaming).

2.    Possible effects on marine life, fish and shellfish culture,
fish stocks and fisheries, seaweed harvesting and culture.

3.    Possible effects on other uses of the sea (e.g. impairment of
water quality for industrial use, underwater corrosion of
structures, interference with ship operations from floating
materials, interference with fishing or navigation through deposit
of waste or solid objects on the sea floor and protection of areas
of special importance for scientific or conservation purposes).

4     The practical availability of alternative land-based methods
of treatment, disposal or elimination, or of treatment to render the
matter less harmful for dumping at sea.
