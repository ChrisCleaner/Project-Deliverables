CONVENTION ON FUTURE MULTILATERAL CO-OPERATION IN THE NORTHWEST
ATLANTIC FlSHERIES [4]

Adopted at Ottawa on 24 October 1978


      The Contracting Parties,

      Noting that the coastal States of the Northwest Atlantic have,
in accordance with relevant principles of international law, extended
their jurisdiction over the living resources of their adjacent waters
to limits of up to two hundred nautical miles from the baselines from
which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, and exercise
within these areas sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and
exploiting, conserving and managing these resources;

      Taking into account the work of the Third United Nations
Conference on the Law of the Sea in the field of fisheries;

      Desiring to promote the conservation and optimum utilization of
the fishery resources of the Northwest Atlantic area within a framework
appropriate to the regime of extended coastal State jurisdiction over
fisheries, and accordingly to encourage international co-operation and
consultation with respect to these resources;

      Have agreed as follows:


Article I

1.    The area to which this Convention applies, hereinafter referred
to as "the Convention Area", shall be the waters of the Northwest
Atlantic Ocean north of 35000' north latitude and west of a line
extending due north from 35000' north latitude and 42000' west
longitude to 59000' north latitude, thence due west to 44000' west
longitude, and thence due north to the coast of Greenland, and the
waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Davis Strait and Baffin Bay south
of 78010' north latitude.

2.    The area referred to in this Convention as "the Regulatory Area"
is that part of the Convention Area which lies beyond the areas in
which coastal States exercise fisheries jurisdiction.

3.    For the purposes of this Convention, "coastal State" shall
hereinafter mean a Contracting Party exercising fisheries jurisdiction
in waters forming part of the Convention Area.

either are immobile on or under the seabed or are unable to move except
in constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil.

5.    Nothing in this Convention shall be deemed to affect or prejudice
the positions or claims of any Contracting Party in regard to internal
waters, the territorial sea, or the limits or extent of the
jurisdiction of any Party over fisheries; or to affect or prejudice the
views or positions of any Contracting Party with respect to the law of
the sea.

of the fishery resources of the Regulatory Area in accordance with the
provisions of this Article.

2.    The Commission may adopt proposals for joint action by the
Contracting Parties designed to achieve the optimum utilization of the
fishery resources of the Regulatory Area. In considering such
proposals, the Commission shall take into account any relevant
information or advice provided to it by the Scientific Council.

3.    In the exercise of its functions under paragraph 2, the
Commission shall seek to ensure consistency between:

(a)   any proposal that applies to a stock or group of stocks occurring
both within the Regulatory Area and within an area under the fisheries
jurisdiction of a coastal State, or any proposal that would have an
effect through species interrelationships on a stock or group of stocks
occurring in whole or in part within an area under the fisheries
jurisdiction of a coastal State; and

(b)   any measures or decisions taken by the coastal State for the
management and conservation of that stock or group of stocks with
respect to fishing activities conducted within the area under its
fisheries jurisdiction.

      The appropriate coastal State and the Commission shall
accordingly promote the co-ordination of such proposals, measures and
decisions. Each coastal State shall keep the Commission informed of its
measures and decisions for the purpose of this Article.

4.    Proposals adopted by the Commission for the allocation of catches
in the Regulatory Area shall take into account the interests of
Commission members whose vessels have traditionally fished within that
Area, and, in the allocation of catches from the Grand Banks and
Flemish Cap, Commission members shall give special consideration to the
Contracting Party whose coastal communities are primarily dependent on
fishing for stocks related to these fishing banks and which has
undertaken extensive efforts to ensure the conservation of such stocks
through international action, in particular, by providing surveillance
and inspection of international fisheries on these banks under an
international scheme of joint enforcement.

5.    The Commission may also adopt proposals for international
measures of control and enforcement within the Regulatory Area for the
purpose of ensuring within that Area the application of this Convention

pertaining to the scientific basis for the management and conservation
of fishery resources within the Regulatory Area and shall specify terms
of reference for the consideration of that question.

9.    The Commission may invite the attention of any or all Commission
members to any matters which relate to the objectives and purposes of
this Convention within the Regulatory Area.


Article XII

1.    If any Commission member presents to the Executive Secretary an
objection to a proposal within sixty days of the date of transmittal
specified in the notification of the proposal by the Executive
Secretary, the proposal shall not become a binding measure until the
expiration of forty days following the date of transmittal specified
in the notification of that object to the Contracting Parties.
Thereupon any other Commission member may similarly object prior to the
expiration of the additional forty-day period, or within thirty days
after the date of transmittal specified in the notification to the
Contracting Parties of any objection presented within that additional
forty-day period whichever shall be the later. The proposal shall then
become a measure binding on all Contracting Parties, except those which
have presented objections, at the end of the extended period or periods
for objecting. If however, at the end of such extended period or
periods, objections have been presented and maintained by a majority
of Commission members, the proposal shall not become a binding measure,
unless any or all of the Commission members nevertheless agree as among
themselves to be bound by it on an agreed date.

2.    Any Commission member which has objected to a proposal may at any
time withdraw that objection and the proposal immediately shall become
a measure binding on such a member, subject to the objection procedure
provided for in this Article.

3.    At any time after the expiration of one year from the date on
which a measure enters into force, any Commission member may give to
the Executive Secretary notice of its intention not to be bound by the
measure, and, if that notice is not withdrawn, the measure shall cease
to be binding on that member at the end of one year from the date of
receipt of the notice by the Executive Secretary. At any time after a
measure has ceased to be binding on a Commission member under this
paragraph, the measure shall cease to be binding on any other
Commission member upon the date a notice of its intention not to be
bound is received by the Executive Secretary.

4.    The Executive Secretary shall immediately notify each Contracting
Party of:

(a)   the receipt of each objection and withdrawal of objection under
paragraphs 1 and 2;

(b)   the date on which any proposal becomes a binding measure under
the provisions of paragraph 1; and

(c)   the receipt of each notice under paragraph 3.


Article XIII

1.    The membership of the Commission shall be reviewed and determined
by the General Council at its annual meeting and shall consist of:

(a)   each Contracting Party which participates in the fisheries of the
Regulatory Area; and

to the General Council that it expects to participate in the fisheries
of the Regulatory Area during the year of that annual meeting or during
the following calendar year.

2.    Each Commission member shall appoint to the Commission not more
than three representatives who may be accompanied at any of its
meetings by alternates, experts and advisers.

The Chairman and Vice-Chairman shall be representatives of different
Commission members.

5.    Any meeting of the Commission, other than the annual meeting
convened pursuant to Article IV may be called by the Chairman at such

votes of all Commission members present and casting affirmative or
negative votes provided that no vote shall be taken unless there is a
quorum of at least two-thirds of the Commission members.

rules for the conduct of its meetings and for the exercise of its
functions.


Article XV

1.    The Secretariat shall provide services to the Organization in the
exercise of its duties and functions.
