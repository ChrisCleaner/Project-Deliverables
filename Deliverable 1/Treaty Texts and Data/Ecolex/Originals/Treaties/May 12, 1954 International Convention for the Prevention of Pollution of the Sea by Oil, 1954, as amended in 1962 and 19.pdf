        cleaned that any effluent therefrom, if it were discharged
        from a stationary tanker into clean calm water on a clear 
        day, would produce no visible traces of oil on the surface 
        of the water; 

    or

   (ii) the discharge of oil or oily mixture from machinery

Organization the penalties actually imposed for each 
infringement.


Article VII

1. As from a date twelve months after the present Convention

Convention.

2. Carrying water ballast in oil fuel tanks shall be avoided 
if possible.


Article VIII

1. Each Contracting Government shall take all appropriate 
steps to promote the provision of facilities as follows:

a) according to the needs of ships using them, ports shall be

causing undue delay to ships of such residues and oily 
mixtures as would remain for disposal from ships other than 
tankers if the bulk of the water had been separated from the 
mixture;

b) oil loading terminals shall be provided with facilities, 
adequate for the reception of such residues and oily mixture 
as would similarly remain for disposal by tankers;

Article IX

1. Of the ships to which the present Convention applies, every 
ship which uses oil fuel and every tanker shall be provided 
with an oil record book, whether as part of the ship's 
official log book or otherwise, in the form specified in the 
Annex to this Convention.

2. The oil record book shall be completed on each occasion, on 
a tank-to-tank basis, whenever any of the following operations

         book.

   In the event of such discharge or escape of oil or oily 
mixture as is referred to in Article IV, a statement shall be 
made in the oil record book of the circumstances of, and the 
reason for, the discharge or escape.

3. Each operation described in paragraph (2) of this Article 
shall be fully recorded without delay in the oil record book 
so that all the entries in the book appropriate to that 
operation are completed. Each page of the book shall be signed 
by the officer or officers in charge of the operations 
concerned and, when the ship is manned, by the master of the 
ship. The written entries in the oil record book shall be in 
an official language of the relevant territory in respect of 
the ship in accordance with paragraph (1) of Article II, or in 
English or French.

4. Oil record books shall be kept in such a place as to be 
readily available for inspection at all reasonable times, and, 
except in the case of unmanned ships under tow, shall be kept 
on board the ship. They shall be preserved for a period of two 
years after the last entry has been made.

5. The competent authorities of any of the territories of a 
Contracting Government may inspect on board any ship to which 
the present Convention applies, while within a port in that 
territory, the oil record book required to be carried in the 
ship in compliance with the provisions of this Article, and 
may make a true copy of an entry in that book and may require 
the master of the ship to certify that the copy is a true copy 
of such entry. Any copy so made which purports to have been 
certified by the master of the ship as a true copy of an entry 
in the ship's oil record book shall be made admissible in any 
judicial proceedings as evidence of the facts stated in the 
entry. Any action by the competent authorities under this 
paragraph shall be taken as expeditiously as possible and the 
ship shall not be delayed.


Article X

1. Any Contracting Government may furnish to the Government of 
the relevant territory in respect of the ship in accordance 
with paragraph (1) of Article II particulars in writing of 
evidence that any provision of the present Convention has been 
contravened in respect of that ship, wheresoever the alleged 
contravention may have taken place. If it is practicable to do 
so, the competent authorities of the former Government shall 
notify the master of the ship of the alleged contravention.

2. Upon receiving such particulars, the Government so informed 
shall investigate the matter, and may request the other 
Government to furnish further or better particulars of the 
alleged contravention. If the Government so informed is 
satisfied that sufficient evidence is available in the form 
required by its law to enable proceedings against the owner or 
master of the ship to be taken in respect of the alleged 
contravention, it shall cause such proceedings to be taken as 
soon as possible. The Government shall promptly inform the 
Government whose official has reported the alleged 
contravention, as well as the Organization, of the action 
taken as a consequence of the information communicated.


Article XI

derogating from the powers of any Contracting Government to 
take measures within its jurisdiction in respect of any matter 
to which the Convention relates or as extending the 
jurisdiction of any Contracting Government.
