CONVENTION ON CIVIL LIABILITY FOR OIL POLLUTION DAMAGE RESULTING
FROM EXPLORATION FOR AND EXPLOITATION OF SEABED MINERAL RESOURCES

Adopted at London on 1 May 1977


      The States Parties to this Convention,

      Conscious of the dangers of oil pollution posed by the
exploration for, and exploitation of, certain seabed mineral
resources,

      Convinced of the need to ensure that adequate compensation is
available to persons who suffer damage caused by such pollution,

      Desiring to adopt uniform rules and procedures for determining
questions of liability and provide adequate compensation in such
cases,

      Have agreed as follows:


Article 1 

      For the purposes of this Convention:

1.    a) "Oil" means crude oil and natural gas liquids, whether or
not such oil or liquids are mixed with or present in other
substances; and

b)    "crude oil" includes crude oil treated to render it suitable
for transmission, for example, by adding or removing certain
fractions.

2. "Installation" means:

a)    any well or other facility, whether fixed or mobile, which is
used for the purpose of exploring for, producing, treating, storing,
transmitting or regaining control of the flow of crude oil from the
seabed or its subsoil;

b)    any well which has been used for the purpose of exploring for,
producing or regaining control of the flow of crude oil from the
seabed or its subsoil and which has been abandoned after the entry
into force of this Convention for the Controlling State concerned;

c)    any well which is used for the purpose of exploring for,
producing or regaining control of the flow of gas or natural gas
liquids from the seabed or its subsoil during the period that any
such well is being drilled, including completion, or worked upon
except for normal maintenance operations;

d)    any well which is used for the purpose of exploring for any
mineral resources other than crude oil, gas or natural gas liquids,
where such exploration involves the deep penetration of the subsoil
of the seabed; and

e)    any facility which is normally used for storing crude oil from
the seabed or its subsoil; which, or a substantial part of which, is
located seaward of the low-water line along the coast as marked on
large-scale charts officially recognized by the Controlling State;
provided, however, that

      (i)  where a well or a number of wells is directly connected
           to a platform or similar facility, the well or wells
           together with such platform or facility shall constitute
           one installation; and

      (ii) a ship as defined in the International Convention on
           Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, done at
           Brussels on 29 November 1969 shall not be considered to
           be an installation.

3.    "Operator" means the person, whether licensee or not,
designated as operator for the purposes of this Convention by the
Controlling State, or, in the absence of such designation, the
person who is in overall control of the activities carried on at the
installation.

4.    "Controlling State" means the State Party which exercises
sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring for and exploiting the
resources of the seabed and its subsoil in the area in or above
which the installator is situated. In the case of an installation
extending over areas in which two or more States Parties exercise
such rights, these States may agree which of them shall be the
Controlling State.

5.    "Person" means any individual or partnership or any public or
private body, whether corporate or not, including a State or any of
its constituent subdivisions.

6.    "Pollution damage" means loss or damage outside the
installation caused by contamination resulting from the escape or
discharge of oil from the installation and includes the cost of
preventive measures and further loss or damage outside the
installation caused by preventive measures.

7.    "Preventive measures" means any reasonable measures taken by
any person in relation to a particular incident to prevent or
minimize pollution damage with the exception of well control
measures and measures taken to protect, repair or replace an
installation.

8.    "Incident" means any occurrence, or series of occurrences
having the same origin, which causes pollution damage.

9.    "Special Drawing Right" means Special Drawing Right as defined
by the International Monetary Fund and used for its own operations
and transactions.


Article 2

      This Convention shall apply exclusively to pollution damage:

a)    resulting from an incident which occurred beyond the coastal
low-water line at an installation under the jurisdiction of a
Controlling State, and

b)    suffered in the territory, including the internal waters and
territorial sea, of a State Party or in the areas in which, in
accordance with international law, it has sovereign rights over
natural resources, and to preventive measures, wherever taken, to
prevent or minimize such pollution damage.


Article 3

1.    Except as provided in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of this Article,
the operator of the installation at the time of an incident shall be
liable for any pollution damage resulting from the incident. When
the incident consists of a series of occurrences, liability for
pollution damage arising out of each occurrence shall attach to the
operator of the installation at the time of that occurrence.

2.    Where an installation has more than one operator they shall be
jointly and severally liable.

3.    No liability for pollution damage shall attach to the operator
if he proves that the damage resulted from an act of war,
hostilities, civil war, insurrection, or a natural phenomenon of an
exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character.

4.    No liability for pollution damage shall attach to the operator
of an abandoned well if he proves that the incident which caused the
damage occurred more than five years after the date on which the
well was abandoned under the authority and in accordance with the
requirements of the Controlling State. Where a well has been
abandoned in other circumstances, the liability of the operator
shall be governed by the applicable national law.

5.    If the operator proves that the pollution damage resulted
wholly or partly either from an act of omission done with intent to
cause damage by the person who suffered the damage or from the
negligence of that person, the operator may be exonerated wholly or
partly from his liability to such person.


Article 4

1.    No claim for compensation for pollution damage shall be made
against the operator otherwise in accordance with this Convention.

2.    No claim for compensation for pollution damage under this
Convention or otherwise may be made against the servants or agents
of the operator.

3.    Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice the question
whether the operator liable for damage in accordance with its
provisions has a right of recourse.


Article 5

1.    When oil has escaped or has been discharged from two or more
installations, and pollution damage results therefrom, the operators
of all the installations concerned, unless exonerated under Article
3, shall be jointly and severally liable for all such damage which
is not reasonably separable.

2.    When oil has escaped or has been discharged from one
installation as a result of an incident, and pollution damage
results therefrom, and during the course of the incident there is a
change of operator, all operators of the installation, unless
exonerated under Article 3, shall be jointly and severally liable
for all such damage which is not reasonably separable.


Article 6

1.    The operator shall be entitled to limit his liability under
this Convention for each installation and each incident to the
amount of 30 million Special Drawing Rights until five years have
elapsed from the date on which the Convention is opened for
signature and to the amount of 40 million Special Drawing Rights
thereafter.
2.              Where operators of different installations are liable in
accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 5, the liability of the
operator of any one installation shall not for any one incident
exceed any limit which may be applicable to him in accordance with
the provisions of this Article and of Article 15.

3.    When in the case of any one installation more than one
operator is liable under this Convention, the aggregate liability of
all of them in respect of any one incident shall not exceed the
highest amount that could be awarded against any of them, but none
of them shall be liable for an amount in excess of the limit
applicable to him.

4.    The operator shall not be entitled to limit his liability if
it is proved that the pollution damage occurred as a result of an
act or omission by the operator himself, done deliberately with
actual knowledge that pollution damage would result.

5.    For the purpose of availing himself of the benefit of
limitation to which he may be entitled under paragraph 1 of this
Article, the operator shall constitute a fund for the total sum
representing the limit of his liability with the court or other
competent authority of any one of the States Parties in which action
is brought under Article 11. A fund constituted by one of the
operators mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 3 shall be deemed to
be constituted by all of them. The fund can be constituted either by
depositing the sum or by producing a bank guarantee or other
guarantee, acceptable under the legislation of the State Party where
the fund is constituted, and considered to be adequately by the
court or other competent liability.

6.    The fund shall be distributed among the claimants in
proportion to the amounts of their established claims.

7.    If before the fund is distributed the operator or any of his
servants or agents or any person providing him with insurance or
other financial security, has, as a result of the incident in
question, paid compensation for pollution damage, such person shall,
up to the amount he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights
which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this
Convention.

8.    The right of subrogation provided for in paragraph 7 of this
Article may also be exercised by a person other than those mentioned
therein in respect of any amount of compensation for pollution
damage which he may have paid but only to the extent that such
subrogation is permitted under the applicable national law.

9.    Where the operator or any other person establishes that he may
be compelled to pay at a later date in whole or in part any such
amount of compensation, with regard to which such person would have
enjoyed a right of subrogation under paragraph 7 or 8 of this
Article, had the compensation been paid before the fund was
distributed, the court or other competent authority of the State
Party where the fund has been constituted may order that a
sufficient sum shall be provisionally set aside to enable such
person at such later date to enforce his claim against the fund.

10.   An operator who has taken preventive measures shall in respect
of those measures have the same rights against the fund as any other
claimant.

11.   The amount referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be
converted into the national currency of the State Party in which the
fund is constituted on the basis of the value of that currency by
reference to the average, during the thirty days immediately
preceding the date on which the fund is constituted, of the Special
Drawing Rights as published by the International Monetary Fund.

12.   The insurer or other person providing financial security shall
be entitled, alone or together with the operator, to constitute a
fund in accordance with this Article on the same conditions and
having the same effect as if it were constituted by the operator.
Such a fund may be constituted even where the pollution damage
occurred as a result of an act or omission by the operator himself,
done deliberately with actual knowledge that pollution damage would
result, but the constitution of the fund shall in that case not
prejudice the rights of any claimant against the operator.


Article 7

1.    Where the operator, after an incident, has constituted a fund
in accordance with Article 6 and is entitled to limit his liability:

a)    no person having a claim for pollution damage arising out of
that incident shall be entitled to exercise any right against any
other assets of the operator in respect of such claim;

b)    the court or other competent authority of any State Party
shall order the release of any property belonging to the operator
which has been arrested in respect of a claim for pollution damage
arising out of that incident, and shall similarly release any bail
or other security furnished to avoid such arrest.

2.    Paragraph 1 of this Article shall, however, only apply if the
claimant has access to the court administering the fund and the fund
is actually available in respect of his claim.

Article 8


1.    To cover his liability under this Convention, the operator
shall be required to have and maintain insurance or other financial
security to such amount, of such type and on such terms as the
Controlling State shall specify, provided that the amount shall not
be less than 22 million Special Drawing Rights until five years have
elapsed from the date on which this Convention is opened for
signature and not less than 35 million Special Drawing Rights
thereafter. However the Controlling State may exempt the operator
wholly or in part from the requirement to have and maintain such
insurance or other financial security to cover his liability for
pollution damage wholly caused by an act of sabotage or terrorism.

2.    An insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the
requirements of this Article if it can cease, for reasons other than
the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security,
before two months have elapsed from the date on which notice of its
termination is given to the competent public authority of the
Controlling State. The foregoing provision shall similarly apply to
any modification which results in the insurance or security no
longer satisfying the requirements of this Article.

3.    Any claim for compensation for pollution damage may be brought
directly against the insurer or other person providing financial
security for the operator's liability for pollution damage. In such
case the liability of the defendant shall be limited to the amount
specified in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article
irrespective of the fact that the pollution damage occurred as a
result of an act or omission by the operator himself, done
deliberately with actual knowledge that pollution damage would
result. The defendant may further avail himself of the defences,
other than the bankruptcy or winding-up of the operator, which the
operator himself would have been entitled to invoke. Furthermore,
the defendant may avail himself of the defence that the pollution
damage resulted from the wilful misconduct of the operator himself,
but the defendant may not avail himself of any other defence which
he might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the
operator against him. The defendant shall in any event have the
right to require the operator to be joined in the proceedings.

4.    Any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security
maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be
available in the first place for the satisfaction of claims under
this Convention.

5.    Where the operator is a State Party, the operator shall not be
required to maintain insurance or other financial security to cover
its liability.
Article 9


1.    A Committee composed of a representative of each State Party
is hereby established.

2.    If a State Party considers that any of the amounts currently
applicable under Article 6 or 8 is no longer adequate, or is
otherwise unrealistic, it may convene a meeting of the Committee to
consider the matter. States which have signed this Convention but
are not yet Parties will be invited to participate in the work of
the Committee as observers. The Committee may recommend to the
States Parties an amendment to any of the amounts if representatives
of at least three-quarters of the States Parties to this Convention
vote in favour of such a recommendation. In making such a
recommendation, the Committee shall take into account:

a)    any information concerning events causing or likely to cause
pollution damage having a bearing on the objects of this Convention;

b)    any information on increases and decreases occurring after the
entry into force of this Convention in the costs of goods and
services of the kinds involved in the treatment and remedying of
marine oil spillages;

c)    the availability of reliable insurance cover against the risk
of liability for pollution damage.

3.    Any amount recommended in accordance with paragraph 2 of this
Article shall be notified by the depositary Government to all States
Parties. It shall replace the amount currently applicable thirty
days after its acceptance by all States Parties. A State Party which
has, within six months of such notification or such other period as
has been specified in the recommendation, notified the depositary
Government that it is unable to accept the recommended amount, shall
be deemed to have accepted it.

4.    If the recommended amount has not been accepted by all States
Parties within six months, or such other period as has been
specified in the recommendation, after it has been notified by the
depositary Government it shall, thirty days thereafter, replace the
amount currently applicable as between those States Parties which
have accepted it. Any other State Party may subsequently accept the
recommended amount which shall become applicable to it thirty days
thereafter.

5.    A State acceding to this Convention shall be bound by any
recommendation of the Committee which has been unanimously accepted
by States Parties. Where a recommendation has not been so accepted,
an acceding State shall be deemed to have accepted it unless, at the
time of its accession, that State notifies the depositary Government
that it does not accept such a recommendation.


Article 10

      Rights of compensation under this Convention shall be
extinguished unless, within twelve months of the date on which the
person suffering the damage knew or ought reasonably to have known
of the damage, the claimant has in writing notified the operator of
his claim or has brought an action in respect of it. However in no
case shall an action be brought after four years from the date of
the incident which caused the damage. Where the incident consists of
a series of occurrences, the four years' period shall run from the
date of the last occurrence.


Article 11

1.    Actions for compensation under this Convention may be brought
only in the courts of any State Party where pollution damage was
suffered as a result of the incident or in the courts of the
Controlling State. For the purpose of determining where the damage
was suffered, damage suffered in an area in which, in accordance
with international law, a State has sovereign rights over natural
resources shall be deemed to have been suffered in that State.

2.    Each State Party shall ensure that its courts possess the
necessary jurisdiction to entertain such actions for compensation.

3.    After the fund has been constituted in accordance with Article
6, the courts of the State Party in which the fund is constituted
shall be exclusively competent to determine all matters relating to
the apportionment and distribution of the fund.


Article 12

1.    Any judgement given by a court with jurisdiction in accordance
with Article 11, which is enforceable in the State of origin where
it is no longer subject to ordinary forms of review, shall be
recognized in any State Party, except:

a)    where the judgement was obtained by fraud; or

b)    where the defendant was not given reasonable notice and a fair
opportunity to present his case.

2.    A judgement recognized under paragraph 1 of this Article shall
be enforceable in each State Party as soon as the formalities
required in that State have been complied with. The formalities
shall not permit the merits of the case to be re-opened, nor a
reconsideration of the applicable law.


Article 13

      Where a State Party is the operator, such State shall be
subject to suit in the jurisdictions set forth in Article 11 and
shall waive all defences based on its status as a sovereign State.


Article 14

      No liability shall arise under this Convention for damage
caused by a nuclear incident:

a)    if the operator of a nuclear installation is liable for such
damage under either the Paris Convention of 29 July 1960 on Third
Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy or the Vienna
Convention of 21 May 1963 on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, or
if the operator of a nuclear ship is liable for such damage under
the Brussels Convention of 25 May 1962 on the Liability of Operators
of Nuclear Ships; or

b)    if the operator of a nuclear installation or the operator of a
nuclear ship is liable for such damage by virtue of a national law
governing the liability for such damage, provided that such law is
in all respects as favourable to persons who may suffer damage as,
in the case of the operator of a nuclear installation, either the
Paris or the Vienna Convention or, in the case of the operator of a
nuclear ship, the Brussels Convention.


Article 15

1.    This Convention shall not prevent a State from providing for
unlimited liability or a higher limit of liability than that
currently applicable under Article 6 for pollution damage caused by
installations for which it is the Controlling State and suffered in
that State or in another State Party; provided however that in so
doing it shall not discriminate on the basis of nationality. Such
provision may be based on the principle of reciprocity.

2.    The courts of each State Party shall apply the law of the
Controlling State in order to determine whether the operator is
entitled under the provisions of this Article and paragraph 1 of
Article 6 to limit his liability and, if so, the amount of such
liability.

3.    Nothing in this Article shall affect the amount of
compensation available for pollution damage suffered in States
Parties in respect of which the provision made in accordance with
paragraph 1 of this Article does not apply.

4.    For the purposes of this Article, pollution damage suffered in
a State Party means pollution damage suffered in the territory of
that State or in the areas in which, in accordance with
international law, it has sovereign rights over natural resources.


Article 16

      This Convention shall be open for signature at London from 1
May 1977 until 30 April 1978 by the States invited to participate in
the Intergovernmental Conference on the Convention on Civil
Liability for Oil Pollution Damage from Offshore Operations, held
there from 20 October to 31 October 1975 and from 13 December to 17
December 1976, and shall thereafter be open for accession by such
States.


Article 17

      This Convention shall be subject to ratification, acceptance
or approval.
Article 18

      The States Parties may unanimously invite to accede to this
Convention other States which have coastlines on the North Sea, the
Baltic Sea or that part of the Atlantic Ocean to the north of 360
North latitude.


Article 19

      The instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval and
accession shall be deposited with the Government of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.


Article 20

1.    This Convention shall enter into force on the ninetieth day
following the date of deposit of the fourth instrument of
ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.

2.    For each State ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to
the Convention after the deposit of the fourth instrument, the
Convention shall enter into force on the ninetieth day after deposit
by such State of its instrument.


Article 21

      A State Party may denounce this Convention at any time by
means of a notice in writing addressed to the depositary Government.
Any such denunciation shall take effect twelve months after the date
on which the depositary Government has received such notice, or at
such later date as may be specified in the notice.


Article 22

1.    Any State may, at the time of ratification, acceptance,
approval or accession or at any later date, declare by means of a
notice in writing addressed to the depositary Government that this
Convention shall apply to all or any of the territories for whose
international relations it is responsible, provided that they are
situated within the area defined in Article 18.

2.    Such declaration shall take effect on the ninetieth day after
its receipt by the depositary Government or, if on such date the
Convention has not yet entered into force, from the date of its
entry into force.

3.    Each State Party which has made a declaration in accordance
with paragraph 1 of this Article may, in accordance with Article 21,
denounce this Convention in relation to all or any of the
territories concerned.


Article 23

      Any State Party may, after having obtained the agreement of at
least one-third of the States Parties, convene a Conference of
States Parties for the revision or amendment of this Convention.


Article 24

      No reservation may be made to this Convention.


Article 25

      The depositary Government shall inform the States referred to
in Article 16 and the acceding States:

a)    of signatures to this Convention, of the deposit of
instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, of
the receipt of notices in accordance with Article 22, and of the
receipt of notices of denunciation;

b)    of the date on which the Convention will enter into force; and

c)    of the recommendations of the Committee convened under Article
9, of the acceptances and non-acceptances of such recommendations,
and of the dates on which these recommendations take effect.

Ireland, which shall send certified copies thereof to the States
referred to in Article 16 and the acceding States and which, upon
its entry into force, shall transmit a certified copy to the
Secretariat of the United Nations for registration and publication
in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations.

In witness whereof the undersigned, being duly authorised thereto,
have signed this Convention.

Done at London this First Day of May, 1977.
