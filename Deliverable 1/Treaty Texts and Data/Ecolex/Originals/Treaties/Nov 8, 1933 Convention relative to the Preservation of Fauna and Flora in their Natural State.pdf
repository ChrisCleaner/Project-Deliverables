such territories.

3.    The present Convention shall apply and shall be applicable in
full to (i) all the territories (i.e., metropolitan territories,
colonies, overseas territories, or territories under suzerainty,
protection, or mandate) of any Contracting Government which are
situated in the continent of Africa, including Madagascar and
Zanzibar; (ii) any other territory in respect of which a Contracting
Government shall have assumed all the obligations of the present
Convention in accordance with the provisions of article 13.

4.    For the purposes of the present Convention the British High

5.    The present Convention shall not have any application, either
in full or in part, to any metropolitan territory not situated in
the continent of Africa, except where and to the extent to which a
declaration effecting such application is made under article 13.

Article 2

For the purposes of the present Convention -

1.    The expression "national park" shall denote an area (a) placed
under public control, the boundaries of which shall not be altered
or any portion be capable of alienation except by the competent
legislative authority, (b) set aside for the propagation, protection
and preservation of wild animal life and wild vegetation, and for
the preservation of objects of aesthetic, geological, prehistoric,
historical, archaeological, or other scientific interest for the
benefit, advantage, and enjoyment of the general public, (c) in
which the hunting, killing or capturing of fauna and the destruction
or collection of flora is prohibited except by or under the
direction or control of the park authorities.

      In accordance with the above provisions facilities shall, so
far as possible, be given to the general public for observing the
fauna and flora in national parks.

2.    The term "strict natural reserve" shall denote an area placed
under public control, throughout which any form of hunting or
fishing, any undertakings connected with forestry, agriculture, or
mining, any excavations or prospecting, drilling, levelling of the
ground, or construction, any work involving the alteration of the
configuration of the soil or the character of the vegetation, any
act likely to harm or disturb the fauna and flora, and the
introduction of any species of fauna and flora whether indigenous or
imported, wild or domesticated, shall be strictly forbidden; which
it shall be forbidden to enter, traverse, or camp in without a
special written permit from the competent authorities; and in which
scientific investigations may only be undertaken by permission of
those authorities.

3.    The expression "animal" or "species" shall denote all
vertebrates and invertebrates (including non-edible fish, but not
including edible fish except in a national park or strict natural
reserve), their nests, eggs, egg-shells, skins, and plumage.

Article 3

1.    The Contracting Government will explore forthwith the
possibility of establishing in their territories national parks and
strict natural reserves as defined in the preceding article. In all
cases where the establishment of such parks or reserves is possible,
the necessary work shall be commenced within two years from the date
of the entry into force of the present Convention.

2.    If in any territory the establishment of a national park or
strict natural reserve is found to be impracticable at present,
suitable areas shall be selected as early as possible in the
development of the territory concerned, and the areas so selected
shall be transformed into national parks or strict natural reserves
as soon as, in the opinion of the authorities of the territory,
circumstances will permit.

Article 4

      The Contracting Governments will give consideration in respect
of each of their territories to the following administrative
arrangements:

1.    The control of all white or native settlements in national
parks with a view to ensuring that as little disturbance as possible
is occasioned to the natural fauna and flora.

2.    The establishment round the borders of national parks and
strict natural reserves of intermediate zones within which the
hunting, killing and capturing of animals may take place under the
control of the authorities of the park or reserve; but in which no
person who becomes an owner, tenant, or occupier after a date to be
determined by the authority of the territory concerned shall have
any claim in respect of depredations caused by animals.

3.    The choice in respect of all national parks of areas
sufficient in extent to cover, so far as possible, the migrations of
the fauna preserved therein.

Article 5

1.    The Contracting Governments shall notify the Government of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of the
establishment of any national parks or strict natural reserves
(defining the area of the parks or reserves), and of the
legislation, including the methods of administration and control,
adopted in connexion therewith.

2.    They shall similarly notify any information relevant to the
purposes of the present Convention and communicated to them by any
national museums or by any societies, national or international,
established within their jurisdiction and interested in those
purposes.

3.    The Government of the United Kingdom will communicate the
information so received to the other Governments whether in full
or in part.

Article 6

      In all cases in which it is proposed to establish in any
territory of a Contracting Government a national park or strict
natural reserve contiguous to a park or reserve situated in another
territory (whether of that Government or of another Contracting
Government), or to the boundary of such territory, there shall be
prior consultation between the competent authorities of the
territories concerned. Similarly, there shall be co-operation
between those authorities subsequent to the establishment of the
park or reserve, or where such a park or reserve is already
established.

Article 7

      Irrespective of any action which may be taken under article 3
of the present Convention, the Contracting Governments shall, as
measures preliminary and supplementary to the establishment of
national parks or strict natural reserves:

1.    Set aside in each of their territories suitable areas (to be
known as reserves) within which the hunting, killing or capturing of
any part of the natural fauna (exclusive of fish) shall be
prohibited save (a) by the permission, given for scientific or
administrative purposes in exceptional cases by the authorities of
the territory or by the central authorities under whom the reserves
are placed, or (b) for the protection of life and property. Licences
granted under article 8, paragraphs 1 and 3, shall not extend to
reserves.

2.    Extend to these areas, as far as may be practicable, a similar
degree of protection to the natural flora.

3.    Consider the possibility of establishing in each of their
territories special reserves for the preservation of species of
fauna and flora which it is desired to preserve, but which are not
otherwise adequately protected, with special reference to species
mentioned in the annex to the present Convention.

4.    Furnish information regarding the reserves established in
accordance with the preceding paragraphs to the Government of the
United Kingdom, which will communicate such information to all the
Governments mentioned in article 5, paragraph 2.

5.    Take, so far as in their power lies, all necessary measures to
ensure in each of their territories a sufficient degree of forest
country and the preservation of the best native indigenous forest
species, and, without prejudice to the provisions of article 2,
paragraph 2, give consideration to the desirability of preventing
the introduction of exotic trees or plants into national parks or
reserves.

6.    Establish as close a degree of co-operation as possible
between the competent authorities of their respective territories
with the object of facilitating
the solution of forestry problems in those territories.

7.    Take the necessary measures to control and regulate so far as
possible the practice of firing the bush on the borders of forests.

8.    Encourage the domestication of wild animals susceptible of
economic utilisation.

Article 8

1.    The protection of the species mentioned in the annex to the
present Convention is declared to be of special urgency and
importance. Animals belonging to the species mentioned in Class A
shall, in each of the territories of the Contracting Governments, be
protected as completely as possible, and the hunting, killing or
capturing of them shall only take place by special permission of the
highest authority in the territory, which shall be given only under
special circumstances, solely in order to further important
scientific purposes, or when essential for the administration of the
territory. Animals belonging to the species mentioned in Class B,
whilst not requiring such rigorous protection as those mentioned in
Class A shall not be hunted, killed, or captured, even by natives,
except under special licence granted by the competent authorities.
For this purpose a special licence shall denote a licence other than
an ordinary game license, granted at the discretion of the competent
authority, and giving permission to hunt, kill, or capture one or
more specimens of a specified animal or animals. Every such licence
shall be limited as regards the period and the area within which
hunting, killing or capturing may take place.

2.    No hunting or other rights already possessed by native chiefs
or tribes or any other persons or bodies, by treaty, concession, or
specific agreement or by administrative permission in those areas in
which such rights have already been definitely recognised by the
authorities of the territory, are to be considered as being in any
way prejudiced by the provisions of the preceding paragraph.

3.    In each of the territories of the Contracting Governments the
competent authorities shall consider whether it is necessary to
apply the provisions of paragraph 1 of the present article to any
species not mentioned in the annex, in order to preserve the
indigenous fauna and flora in each area, and, if they deem it
necessary, shall apply those provisions to any such species to the
extent which they consider desirable. They shall similarly consider
whether it is necessary in the territory concerned to accord to any
of the species mentioned in Class B of the annex the special
protection accorded to the species mentioned in Class A.

4.    The competent authorities shall also give consideration to the
question of protecting species of animals or plants which by general
admission are useful to man or of special scientific interest.

5.    Nothing in the present article shall (i) prejudice any right
which may exist under the local law of any territory to kill animals
without a licence in defence of life or property, or (ii) affect the
right of the authorities of the territory to permit the hunting,
killing, or capturing of any species (a) in time of famine, (b) for
the protection of human life, public health, or domestic stock, (c)
for any requirement relating to public order.

6.    Each Contracting Government shall furnish to the Government of
the United Kingdom information on the subject of the measures
adopted in each of its territories in regard to the grant of
licences, and in regard to the animals, the destruction or capture
of which is, in accordance with paragraph 3 of this article, not
permitted except under licence. The Government of the United Kingdom
will communicate any such information to all the Governments
mentioned in article 5, paragraph 2.

Article 9

1.    Each Contracting Government shall take the necessary measures
to control and regulate in each of its territories the internal, and
the import and export, traffic in, and the manufacture of articles
from, trophies as defined in paragraph 8 of the present article,
with a view to preventing the import or export of, or any dealing in
trophies other than such as have been originally killed, captured or
collected in accordance with the laws and regulations of the
territory concerned.

2.    The export of trophies to any destination whatsoever shall be
prohibited unless the exporter has been granted a certificate
permitting export and issued by a competent authority. Such
certificate shall only be issued where the trophies have been
lawfully imported or lawfully obtained. In the event of an attempted
export without any certificate having been granted, the authorities
of the territory where this attempt takes place shall apply such
penalties as they may think necessary.

3.    The import of trophies which have been exported from any
territory to which the present Convention is applicable in full,
whether a territory of another Contracting Government or not, shall
be prohibited except on production of a certificate or lawful
export. failing which the trophy shall be confiscated, but without
prejudice to the application of the penalties mentioned in the
preceding paragraph.

4.    The import and export of trophies, except at
places where there is a customs station, shall be prohibited.

5.    (a)  Every trophy consisting of ivory and rhinoceros horn
           exported in accordance with the provisions of the present
           article shall be identified by marks which, together with
           the weight of the trophy shall be recorded in the
           certificate of lawful export.

      (b)  Every other trophy shall, if possible, be similarly
           marked and recorded, but shall in any event be described
           in the certificate so as to identify it with as much
           certainty as possible.

      (c)  The Contracting Governments shall take such measures as
           may be possible by the preparation and circulation of
           appropriate illustrations or otherwise to instruct their
           customs officers in the methods of identifying the
           species mentioned in the annex to the present Convention
           and the trophies derived therefrom.

6.    The measures contemplated in paragraph 1 of the present
article shall include provisions that found ivory, rhinoceros horn
and all trophies of animals found dead, or accidentally killed, or
killed in defence of any persons, shall, in principle, be the
property of the Government of the territory concerned, and shall be
disposed of according to regulations introduced by that Government,
due regard being had to the native rights and customs reserved in
the succeeding paragraph.

7.    No rights of the kind specified in paragraph 2 of article 8
are to be considered as being prejudiced by the provisions of the
preceding paragraphs.

8.    For the purposes of the present article the expression
"trophy" shall denote any animal, dead or alive, mentioned in the
annex to the Convention, or anything part of or produced from any
such animal when dead, or the eggs, eggshells, nests or plumage of
any bird so mentioned. The expression "trophy" shall not, however,
include any trophy or part of a trophy which by a process of bona
fide manufacture, as contemplated in paragraph 1 of the present
article, has lost its original identity.

9.    Each Contracting Government shall furnish to the Government of
the United Kingdom information as to the measures taken in order to
carry out the obligations of the present article or any part of
them. The Government of the United Kingdom will communicate any
information so received to all the Governments mentioned in article
5, paragraph 2.

Article 10

1.    The use of motor vehicles or aircraft (including aircraft
lighter than air) shall be prohibited in the territories of the
Contracting Governments, both (i) for the purpose of hunting,
killing, or capturing animals, and (ii) in such manner as to drive,
stampede, or disturb them for any purpose whatsoever, including that
of filming or photographing, provided, however, that nothing in the
present paragraph shall affect the right of occupiers in respect of
land occupied by them, or of Governments in respect of land utilised
for public purposes, to use motor vehicles or aircraft for the
purpose of driving away, capturing or destroying animals found on
such land in all cases where such ejection, capture or destruction
is not prohibited by any other provision of the present Convention.

2.    The Contracting Governments shall prohibit in their
territories the surrounding of animals by fires for hunting
purposes. Wherever possible, the under-mentioned methods of
capturing or destroying animals shall also be generally prohibited:

      (a)  the use of poison, or explosives for killing fish;

      (b)  the use of dazzling lights, flares, poison, or poisoned
           weapons for hunting animals;

      (c)  the use of nets, pits, or enclosures, gins, traps or
           snares, or of set guns and missiles containing explosives
           for hunting animals.
