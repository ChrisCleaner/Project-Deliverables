REGION

1. In this Appendix:

a) "the American tropics" means those parts of the continent of 
America, including adjacent islands, which are bounded by the 
Tropic of Capricorn (latitude 23 1/2 deg S) and the Tropic of

this Appendix, at a place approved by the Competent Authority of 
the importing territory and situated outside the Region and 
outside the American tropics and any other country in which South
