ASEAN AGREEMENT ON TRANSBOUNDARY HAZE POLLUTION


The Parties to this Agreement,

REAFFIRMING the commitment to the aims and purposes of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as set forth in the
Bangkok Declaration of 8 August 1967, in particular to promote regional
co-operation in Southeast Asia in the spirit of equality and partnership
and thereby contribute towards peace, progress and prosperity in the
region,

RECALLING the Kuala Lumpur Accord on Environment and
Development which was adopted by the ASEAN Ministers of
Environment on 19 June 1990 which calls for, inter alia, efforts leading
towards the harmonisation of transboundary pollution prevention and
abatement practices,

RECALLING ALSO the adoption of the 1995 ASEAN Co-operation
Plan on Transboundary Pollution, which specifically addressed
transboundary atmospheric pollution and called for, inter alia,
establishing procedures and mechanisms for co-operation among ASEAN
Member States in the prevention and mitigation of land and/or forest fires
and haze,

DETERMINED to give effect to the 1997 Regional Haze Action Plan
and to the Hanoi Plan of Action which call for fully implementing the
1995 ASEAN Cooperation Plan on Transboundary Pollution, with
particular emphasis on the Regional Haze Action Plan by the year 2001,

RECOGNISING the existence of possible adverse effects of
transboundary haze pollution,

CONCERNED that a rise in the level of emissions of air pollutants
within the region as forecast may increase such adverse effects,

RECOGNISING the need to study the root causes and the implications
of the transboundary haze pollution and the need to seek solutions for the
problems identified,

AFFIRMING their willingness to further strengthen international co-operation
to develop national policies for preventing and monitoring
transboundary haze pollution,

AFFIRMING ALSO their willingness to co-ordinate national action for
preventing and monitoring transboundary haze pollution through
exchange of information, consultation, research and monitoring,

DESIRING to undertake individual and joint action to assess the origin,
causes, nature and extent of land and/or forest fires and the resulting haze,
to prevent and control the sources of such land and/or forest fires and the
resulting haze by applying environmentally sound policies, practices and
technologies and to strengthen national and regional capabilities and co-operation
in assessment, prevention, mitigation and management of land
and/or forest fires and the resulting haze,

CONVINCED that an essential means to achieve such collective action
is the conclusion and effective implementation of an Agreement,
