PROTOCOL CONCERNING CO-OPERATION IN COMBATING OIL SPILLS IN THE 
WIDER CARIBBEAN REGION

Cartagena de Indias, 24 March 1983


 The Contracting Parties to this Protocol,

Being Contracting Parties to the Convention for the Protection 
and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean 
Region, done at Cartagena de Indias on 24 March 1983,

Conscious that oil exploration, production and refining 
activities, as well as related marine transport, pose a threat of 
significant oil spills in the wider Caribbean region,

Aware that the islands of the region are particularly 
vulnerable, owing to the fragility of their ecosystems and the 
economic reliance of certain of them on the continuous 
utilization of their coastal areas, to damage resulting from 
significant oil pollution,

Recognizing that, in the event of an oil spill or the threat 
thereof, prompt and effective action should be taken initially at 
the national level, to organize and co-ordinate prevention, 
mitigation and clean-up activities,

Recognizing further the importance of sound preparation, 
co-operation and mutual assistance in responding effectively to 
oil spills or the threat thereof,

Determined to avert, through the adoption of measures to prevent 
and combat pollution resulting from oil spills, damage to the 
marine environment, including coastal areas, of the wider 
Caribbean region,

 Have agreed as follows:
