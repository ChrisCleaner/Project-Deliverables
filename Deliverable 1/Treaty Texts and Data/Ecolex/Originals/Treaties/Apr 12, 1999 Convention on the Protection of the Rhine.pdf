Convention on the Protection of the Rhine  

      The Governments of:

      the Federal Republic of Germany
      the French Republic
      the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
      the Kingdom of the Netherlands
      the Swiss Confederation
      And the European Union

      Desiring to work towards the sustainable development of the Rhine 
      ecosystem on the basis of a comprehensive approach, taking into 
      consideration the precious character of the stream, its banks and alluvial 
      areas,

      With the intention of reinforcing their co-operation aimed at maintaining 
      and improving the Rhine ecosystem,

      Referring to the Convention of March 17, 1992 on the Protection and Use of 
      Transboundary Water Courses and International Lakes and to the Convention 
      of September 1992 on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the 
      Northeast Atlantic Ocean,

      Taking into account the work carried out within the framework of the 
      Agreement of April 29, 1963 on the International Commission on the 
      Protection of the Rhine against Pollution and the additional agreement of 
      December 1976,

      Considering that the improvement of water quality achieved under the 
      Convention of December 3, 1976 on the Protection of the Rhine against 
      Chemical Pollution and under the "Rhine" Action Programme of September 30, 
      1987 must be continued
      Bearing in mind that the restoration of the Rhine is also necessary in 
      order to maintain and improve the ecosystem of the North Sea,
      Conscious of the fact that the Rhine is an important European shipping 
      lane serving different uses

      Have agreed as follows:

      For the Governments of
      the Federal Republic of Germany:

      Annex
      Arbitration
      1. As long as the parties to the dispute do not decide otherwise, the 
      arbitration procedures according to this annex are applicable.
      2. The court of arbitration has three members; the claimant as well as the 
      defendant appoint one arbitrator each; the two arbitrators thus appointed 
      agree on the third arbitrator who acts as the chairman of the court of 
      arbitration
      If the chairman of the court of arbitration has not been appointed within 
      two months after the appointment of the second arbitrator, the President 
      of the International Court of Justice appoints an arbitrator within two 
      further months upon the demand of the party acting first.
      3. If one of the parties to the dispute has not appointed an arbitrator 
      within two months following the receipt of the demand according to Article 
      16 of the Convention, the other party may address itself to the President 
      of the International Court of Justice who will appoint the chairman of the 
      court of arbitration within a further two months. As soon as the chairman 
      of the court of arbitration has been appointed, he calls upon the party 
      which has not yet appointed any arbitrator to do so within two months. 
      After the expiry of this time limit he seizes the President of the 
      International Court of Justice who appoints someone within the two months 
      to come.
      4. Should the President of the International Court of Justice be prevented 
      in the above mentioned cases or be subject of one of the parties to the 
      dispute, the chairman of the court of arbitration or the arbitrator are 
      appointed by the vice-president of the International Court of Justice or 
      by the most senior member of the International Court of Justice who is not 
      subject of one of the parties to the dispute.
      5. These regulations apply mutatis mutandis when constituting other 
      positions becoming vacant.
      6. The court of arbitration takes its decisions according to the rules of 
      international law and particularly according to the rules of the 
      Convention.
      7. Decisions of the court of arbitration concerning questions of procedure 
      as well as material questions are taken with the majority of the votes of 
      its members; absence or abstention of one of the members of the court 
      appointed by the parties does not hinder the court in taking a decision. 
      In the event of an equality of votes the chairman shall have the casting 
      vote. Decisions taken by the Court are binding for the parties which cover 
      the costs for the arbitrator they have appointed and share the other costs 
      at equal part. For any further questions the court of arbitration decides 
      upon the proceedings.
      8. Should disputes arise between two contracting parties of which only one 
      is member of the European Community - which itself is Contracting Party - 
      the other party simultaneously addresses the corresponding motion to this 
      member state and to the European Community which in common reply to this 
      party within a time limit of two months after receipt of the motion 
      whether the member state, the European Community or the member state and 
      the European Community will in common act as party to the dispute. If such 
      a reply is not given within the time limit, the member state and the 
      European Community are considered to be one and the same party to the 
      dispute in application of this annex. This is equally valid if the member 
      state and the Community in common act as party to the dispute.
