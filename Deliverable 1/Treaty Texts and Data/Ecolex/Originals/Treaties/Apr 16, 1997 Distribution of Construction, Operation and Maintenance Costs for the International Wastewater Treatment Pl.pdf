<h3>
Distribution of Construction, Operation and Maintenance&nbsp;<br>
Costs for the International Wastewater Treatment Plant&nbsp;<br>
Constructed Under the Agreements in Commission Minute NO. 283&nbsp;<br>
for the Solution of the Border Sanitation Problem&nbsp;<br>
At San Diego, California/Tijuana, Baja California</h3></center>
The Commission met in the offices of the United States Section in El Paso
Texas at 8:00 a.m. on April 16, 1997 to recommend to the two Governments
the specific distribution costs of construction, operation and maintenance
of the International Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) under the terms
of International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) Minute No. 283, entitled,
"Conceptual Plan for the Solution of the Border Sanitation Problem in San
Diego, California/Tijuana, Baja California," signed July 2, 1990.
<p>The Commissioners observed that in Resolution No. 8 of Minute No. 283
the IBWC should recommend, for the approval of the two Governments, the
specific cost corresponding to each country for the construction, operation
and maintenance of the IWTP.
<p><b>A. General</b>
<p>The Commissioners reviewed the activities carried out by each country
in furtherance of Minute No. 283 and made the following observations:
<ul>
<li>
Mexico is completing the sewage collection works and the work necessary
in Mexico to convey the collected Tijuana sewage to the IWTP.</li>

<li>
The United States is completing the construction of the IWTP and conveyance
and ocean discharge system. The United States is scheduled to complete
construction and begin operation in April 1997 of the advanced primary
treatment module with a capacity of 25 million gallons per day (mgd) or
1100 liters per second (lps). The United States has developed an operations
and maintenance manual for the advanced primary treatment module. A secondary
treatment module is under design and an environmental review is underway
to determine the best alternative to achieve secondary treatment. Construction
of the outfall system for ocean discharge is underway with completion scheduled
for 1998. Also, the Commissioners continue to analyze the environmental
studies being conducted in the United States as part of an analysis of
alternatives to best achieve secondary treatment.</li>

<li>
The IBWC Commissioners have coordinated, with the responsible authorities
in each country, the necessary actions for treatment at the plant site
and removal to Mexico of the sludge generated from Tijuana wastewaters
in the advanced primary treatment module. The sludge will be removed from
the IWTP each day. Mexico is completing arrangements for disposal, in its
territory, of the sludge at a site approved for such disposal in accordance
with applicable Mexican legislation.</li>

<li>
The United States is considering alternatives for the interim discharge
of the advanced primary treated effluent. The alternatives include a) continued
use of the emergency connection up to 13 mgd (570 lps), b) discharge to
the Tijuana River of advanced primary treated effluent, and c) return of
an advanced primary treated effluent to Mexico. The Commissioners observed
that in the case that the alternative for temporary discharge of an advanced
primary treated effluent to Mexico is selected, the IBWC would support
the necessary arrangements for the construction of an appropriate conveyance
and disposal system in Mexico that would be properly coordinated with Pumping
Plant No. 1 in Tijuana. They also observed that in case of a temporary
discharge of primary treated effluent using the emergency connection to
the City of San Diego, Mexico's cooperation would be necessary to handle,
to extent possible, the flows generated in excess of the emergency connection
capacity.</li>

<li>
The IBWC Commissioners observed the progress in the Tijuana wastewater
characterization programs for wastewaters that would be conveyed to the
IWTP. The data will allow a) identification of pollutant limits that would
protect the efficiency of the IWTP and b) delivery of data to Mexico for
Mexico's implementation of its industrial wastewater pretreatment programs
in Tijuana based on standards in Mexico. Under such programs discharges
of industrial wastewaters into this system must not exceed limits for non-conventional
pollutants. The Commissioners considered it appropriate that the IBWC,
with the expert recommendation of the specialized water quality agencies
of each country, should determine the limits of pollutant concentrations
that if exceeded would harm the plant's efficiency. The Commissioners observed
that the Commission would monitor the plant's effluent for non-conventional
pollutants each six months and more frequently in the event that excessive
concentrations of non-conventional pollutants are detected. The results
would be provided to the appropriate officials in Mexico so that those
officials can identify the source of these pollutants and apply the appropriate
laws. As the IWTP is located in the United States and will discharge to
the coastal waters in the United States, the ocean discharge must meet
quality standards established in the United States, under a permit granted
to the United States Section of the IBWC.</li>

<li>
The Mexican Commissioner informed that Mexico continues to evaluate alternatives
for treatment of future Tijuana sewage in excess of the 25 mgd (1100 lps)
assigned for Tijuana in the IWTP, which at an opportune time will be discussed
before the IBWC in the context of Minute No. 261. In such case, the IBWC
would determine whether it is practical to expand the IWTP to handle Tijuana
flows in excess of the 25 mgd (1100 lps) assigned to Mexico in the IWTP
and, if so, make recommendations on the terms of Mexico's financial participation
in such expansion.</li>
</ul>
<b>B. Distribution of Construction, Operation and Maintenance Costs</b>
<p>The Commissioners noted that discussions were held by the Principal
Engineers of the IBWC on studies developed by Mexico's National Water Commission
(CNA) regarding the costs of construction, operation and maintenance of
the wastewater plant that Mexico planned to construct in the Rio Alamar,
had Mexico not participated in the international plant. The Commissioners
reviewed the information presented by the Principal Engineers and considered,
as appropriate, the amount of $16.8 million (U.S. currency) as the cost
that Mexico would have expended to construct a treatment plant (Rio Alamar
plant) in Mexico. Under the terms of Resolution No. 7 of Minute No. 283,
Mexico would cover this corresponding share in 10 annual installments of
$1.68 million each upon the start of the IWTP operation, with the first
payment due on December 15, 1997. The payment method was developed in a
consensus with the Comisi&oacute;n Estatal de Servicios P&uacute;blicos
de Tijuana (CESPT), and the CNA to make the necessary adjustments in an
internal cash flow that will allow payment in the amount corresponding
to Mexico. This procedure will be followed for subsequent payments toward
the total amount to cover the payment on December 15 of each year.
<p>The Commissioners also reviewed the information presented by the Principal
Engineers, in Exhibit A, and considered, as appropriate for the capacity
of 25 mgd (1100 lps), the amount of $0.034 per cubic meter (U.S. currency)
as the cost that Mexico would have expended in 1997 in the operation and
maintenance of the Rio Alamar plant. They observed that for subsequent
years, adjustments in costs, as needed, would be applied based on Mexican
economy. The CESPT should participate in the annual review of the operation
and maintenance costs to enable this organization to incorporate such increases
in its budget in subsequent years. Further, the Commissioners observed
that Mexico, through CESPT, should begin to cover its part of the costs
of the IWTP operation and maintenance once the treatment plant is in operation.
Such payments will be made in quarterly. The monthly payments would be
made within 10 days of the month corresponding to the end of each quarter.
The payment schedule was defined in a consensus with the CESPT allowing
for necessary internal cash flow adjustments to cover the payment. A cost
adjustment factor would be estimated for the next year based on the prior
year's performance. A final accounting would be performed at the end of
the year.
<p>The Commissioners considered that the two Sections of the Commission
will ensure, at least once a month, a systematic exchange and sharing of
information with the CESPT and the agency responsible for the IWTP operation,
hydrometric data generated through IWTP system measuring devices, including
but not limited to, influent from Mexico in order to carry out an adequate
accounting of the flows delivered for treatment at the IWTP as well as
effluent from the IWTP. The Commissioners considered it appropriate for
the Principal Engineers to develop a similar program for the effluent data
generated from the treatment and ocean discharge systems in the United
States and Mexico before the ocean outfall operations begin.
<p>Finally, the Commissioners observed that in the event that Tijuana wastewaters
from canyon and other collectors as may be conveyed for treatment at the
IWTP, the operations and maintenance costs that Mexico would cover for
these volumes would be the same as those in the prior paragraphs, that
is $0.034 per cubic meter of sewage treated. The Mexican Section will inform
the United States Section in a timely manner of such discharges and their
estimated volumes. The volumes would exclude flows from ruptured drinking
water lines and from storm runoff. The payments for treatment of these
wastewaters will be covered in the quarterly payment by Mexico for the
waters conveyed to the IWTP in the international collector up to the capacity
of 25 mgd (1100 lps). Should the discharges from all of these points exceed
an average of 25 mgd (1100 lps), computed each quarter, the Commission
will determine the costs chargeable to Mexico for treating such excess
discharges.
<p>Based on the above considerations, the Commissioners adopted the following
resolutions for the approval of the two Governments:
<dl compact>
<dt>
1.</dt>

<dd>
The IWTP construction costs chargeable to Mexico will be $16.8 million
(United States currency) an amount which corresponds to the total amount
that Mexico would have expended to construct the Rio Alamar treatment plant,
had Mexico not participated in construction of the IWTP. Mexico will pay
this amount to the United States in 10 annual fixed installments of $1.68
million (United States currency) each upon the start of the IWTP operations,
with the first annual payment to be provided on December 15, 1997. The
payment method was developed in a consensus with the Comisi&oacute;n Estatal
de Servicios P&uacute;blicos de Tijuana (CESPT), and the CNA to make the
necessary adjustments in an internal cash flow that will allow payment
in the amount corresponding to Mexico. This procedure will be followed
for subsequent payments toward the total amount to cover the payment on
December 15 of each year.</dd>

<dt>
2.</dt>

<dd>
The operation and maintenance costs of the IWTP chargeable to Mexico for
up to 25 mgd (1100 lps) will be $0.034 per cubic meter (U.S. currency)
as the cost that Mexico would have expended in 1997 in the operation and
maintenance of the Rio Alamar plant. In subsequent years, adjustments,
as needed, to costs would be applied based on Mexican economy. The CESPT
should participate in the annual review of the operation and maintenance
costs to enable this organization to incorporate, in a timely manner, such
increases in its budget in subsequent years. Cost adjustment factors would
be estimated for the next year based on the prior year's performance. A
final accounting would be performed at the end of the year.</dd>

<dt>
3.</dt>

<dd>
For the construction and operations and maintenance payments, the Mexican
Section of the IBWC will collect the amounts corresponding to the CESPT
and, where appropriate, to the CNA in order to complete the payment to
the U.S. Section of the IBWC in accordance with IBWC procedures in effect
for these purposes.</dd>

<dt>
4.</dt>

<dd>
Mexico will begin to cover its proportionate costs of the IWTP operation
and maintenance corresponding to point 2) upon the start of operations
of the IWTP. The quarterly payment will be made within 10 days after the
end of each quarter, in a procedure developed in a consensus with the CESPT
for the necessary internal cash flow adjustments that will allow its payment.</dd>

<dt>
5.</dt>

<dd>
The United States Section will provide to the Mexican Section a copy of
the operations and maintenance manual developed for the IWTP to allow the
responsible Mexican authorities to understand the IWTP operations criteria.</dd>

<dt>
6.</dt>

<dd>
In the event that Tijuana wastewaters from canyon and other collectors
are conveyed for treatment at the IWTP, the operations and maintenance
costs that Mexico through the CESPT would cover for these volumes would
be the same as those in the prior paragraphs, that is $0.034 per cubic
meter of sewage treated. The Mexican Section, with the prior consultation
with the CESPT, will inform the United States Section in a timely manner
of such discharges and their estimated volumes which would not include
drinking water from ruptured lines or storm runoff. The payments for treatment
of these wastewaters will be incorporated by the CESPT in the quarterly
payment by Mexico for the waters conveyed to the IWTP in the international
collector up to the capacity of 25 mgd (1100 LPs). In the event that discharges
from all of these points exceed an average of 25 mgd (1100 LPs), assigned
to Mexico, computed each quarter, the Commission will determine the charges
to Mexico corresponding to treat the excess discharges.</dd>

<dt>
7.</dt>

<dd>
The two Sections of the Commission will ensure, and at least monthly, a
systematic exchange of information with the CESPT and the agency responsible
for the IWTP operation, hydrometric data generated through IWTP system
measuring devices, including but not limited to, influent from Mexico in
order to carry out an adequate accounting of the flows delivered for treatment
at the IWTP as well as effluent from the IWTP. The Commissioners consider
it appropriate that the Principal Engineers develop a similar program for
the effluent data generated from the effluent data generated from the treatment
and ocean discharge systems in the United States and Mexico before the
ocean outfall operations begin.</dd>

<dt>
8.</dt>

<dd>
The IBWC will review, in the context of Minute No. 261, alternatives being
considered by Mexico for treatment of future Tijuana sewage in excess of
the 25 mgd (1100 LPs) identified for Tijuana in the IWTP. As part of this
review, the IBWC will make recommendations to the governments as to the
practicality of expanding the IWTP to handle flows in excess of 25 mgd
(1100 lps) assigned to Mexico in the IWTP and if so, develop recommendations
for the terms of Mexico's financial participation in such expansion.</dd>

<dt>
9.</dt>

<dd>
The IBWC will continue to analyze the environmental studies being conducted
in the United States regarding alternatives for the best means of achieving
secondary treatment.</dd>

<dt>
10.</dt>

<dd>
The Commission will continue to characterize inflows to of the appropriate
water quality authorities of each country, the limits of pollutant concentrations
in the system that, if exceeded, would harm the efficiency of the international
plant. The Commission will monitor inflows at the international boundary
for potential exceedences and provide the information to the Government
of Mexico so that the proper authorities in Mexico can apply those limits
in applying appropriate pretreatment laws.</dd>

<dt>
11.</dt>

<dd>
In case of an interim discharge of advanced primary treated effluent to
Mexico, the IBWC will make the necessary arrangements for an appropriate
conveyance and disposal infrastructure system in Mexico.</dd>

<dt>
12.</dt>

<dd>
In the case of an interim discharge of advanced primary treated effluent
utilizing emergency connection to the city of San Diego, the cooperation
of Mexico would be necessary to handle, to the extent possible, the flows
in excess of the emergency connection capacity as may be generated.</dd>

<dt>
13.</dt>

<dd>
The IBWC will review and recommend to the two Governments the additional
infrastructure needed to collect sewage that is currently discharged to
the Tijuana River through storm and other drains such that there is no
discharge of untreated sanitary or industrial wastewaters in the international
boundary between San Diego and Tijuana.</dd>

<dt>
14.</dt>

<dd>
All activities carried out pursuant to this Minute will be subject to the
availability of appropriated funds, resources and personnel and applicable
laws and regulations of each country.</dd>

<dt>
15.</dt>

<dd>
This Minute shall enter into force when the Government of the United States
of America and the Government of the United Mexican States have each provided
written notification through their Section of IBWC of its approval.</dd>
