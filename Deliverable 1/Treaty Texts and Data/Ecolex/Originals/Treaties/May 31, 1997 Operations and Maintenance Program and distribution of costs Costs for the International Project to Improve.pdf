<h3>
Operations and Maintenance Program<br>
and Distribution of its Costs for the International Project<br>
to Improve the Quality of the Waters of the Rio Grande<br>
at Laredo, Texas-Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas</h3>
The Commission met in the offices of the Mexican Section in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez,
Chihuahua, at 10:00 a.m. on May 31, 1997 to recommend to the two Governments
an operations and maintenance program and distribution of its costs for
the international project to improve the quality of the waters of the Rio
Grande at Laredo, Texas-Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. The Commissioners pointed
out that the Governments of the United States and Mexico in Resolution
No. 4 of Commission Minute No.279, entitled "Joint Measures to Improve
the Quality of the Waters of the Rio Grande at Laredo, Texas-Nuevo Laredo,
Tamaulipas", signed August 28, 1989, agreed to jointly fund the construction,
operation and maintenance of the six elements of this international project.
Further, they observed that the Commission in Resolutions Nos. 8 and 9
of Minute No. 279 must reach an agreement on the division of these costs
and recommend to the two Governments a specific operations and maintenance
program.
<p>The Commissioners reviewed, and found satisfactory, the "Joint Report
of the Principal Engineers Concerning Recommendations for the Operation
and Maintenance of the International Project to Improve the Quality of
the Waters of the Rio Grande at Laredo, Texas-Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas
Established in Minute No. 279," signed by United States Section Principal
Engineer Jose S. Valdez and Mexican Section Principal Engineer Luis Antonio
Rasc&oacute;n Mendoza on November 9, 1995. The Commissioners noted that
the installation and construction of the six principal elements of the
international project, a) Riverside Collector, b) Coyotes I Collector,
c) Sewage Collection Expansion, d) Sewage Collection Rehabilitation, e)
Pumping Plant and f) Treatment Plant, were essentially completed in July
1996. The Commissioners noted that an operations and maintenance manual
is being completed by Mexico that is consistent with the referenced criteria.
Such manual would be subject to upgrading as conditions warrant.
<p>The Commissioners referred to the "Joint Report of the Principal Engineers
Recommending the Distribution of Costs Between the Two Countries for the
Operation and Maintenance of the Nuevo Laredo International Project Authorized
in IBWC Minute No. 279", signed by United States Section Principal Engineer
Carlos Marin and Mexican Section Principal Engineer Luis Antonio Rasc&oacute;n
Mendoza on May 30, 1997. The Commissioners noted that the Principal Engineers
took into account the costs for the six principal elements of the international
project that should correspond to the United States considering that for
Mexico the discharge standards for wastewaters to the Rio Grande from Nuevo
Laredo are different than those in the United States, such that the discharge
from the Nuevo Laredo treatment plant should meet the international standards
agreed to in Commission Minute No. 279, provided that the control measures
necessary to meet such standards are jointly financed by the governments
of the United States and Mexico. Further, the Commissioners noted that
the Principal Engineers recommended a cost to the United States that corresponds
to the difference between the cost to Mexico of operation and maintenance
for Mexico to meet its national effluent standards established for Nuevo
Laredo, Tamaulipas and the costs of operation necessary to meet the effluent
standards used for the international plant. The Commissioners also considered
the Mexican Government's objective of strengthening the operating organizations.
As such the operating organization would need stronger support in the earlier
years of the operation and maintenance while it undergoes capacity building.
<p>The Commissioners reviewed the procedures for distribution of costs
between the two countries recommended by the Principal Engineers in the
Joint Report of May 30, 1997, and observed that the Principal Engineers
propose that the United States cover its participation in the estimated
costs of operating and maintaining the six principal elements of the Nuevo
Laredo International Sanitation Project through 2005 in distributed United
States contribution based on actual costs of $350,000 in 1996 and $700,000
in 1997. They also observed the position of the United States that based
on an estimated total cost range of $15.0 million to $27.49 million for
a 10 year period, the United States is not prepared to have its participation
exceed 33.3 percent of the total actual costs in that period. Such distributed
United States participation would be subject to review at the end of each
year against the actual costs and the information provided to the IBWC
by the Mexican Section regarding the progress made in achieving the Mexican
Government's objective to strengthen the operating organization in Nuevo
Laredo, Tamaulipas. Further, the Commissioners noted the recommendation
that Mexico, through the Nuevo Laredo operating agency, would cover the
difference through 2005 between the actual costs of the international sanitation
project and the United States contribution. In this respect, the Mexican
Section, supported by documentation provided by the operating agency, will
arrive with the United States Section at statements of actual costs indicating
those costs to be covered with the distributed United States funds and
those paid by Mexico over and above the United States contribution.
<p>The Commissioners also considered the recommendation that at the end
of this period in 2005, the Commission would review the distribution of
costs agreement, and make recommendations. This would consider the difference
in Mexico's discharge standards applicable for the Rio Grande in Nuevo
Laredo and those standards established in Minute No. 279 and against the
capacity of the operating organization to totally cover the costs of operating
the plant. Finally, the Commissioners noted, and found satisfactory, the
specific procedures for monthly charges and payments recommended in the
Joint Report.
<p>Based on the above considerations, the Commissioners adopted the following
resolutions for the approval of the two Governments:
<ol>
<li>
The "Joint Report of the Principal Engineers "Concerning Recommendations
for the Operation and Maintenance of the International Project to Improve
the Quality of the Waters of the Rio Grande at Laredo, Texas-Nuevo Laredo,

Engineer Jose S. Valdez and Mexican Section Principal Engineer Luis Antonio
Rasc&oacute;n Mendoza on November 9, 1995 is adopted, and forms an integral
part of this Minute, as the specific operations and maintenance program
required by Resolution No. 9 of Commission Minute No. 279, entitled "Joint
Measures To Improve the Quality of the Waters of the Rio Grande at Laredo,
Texas-Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas," signed August 28, 1989, with the understanding
that Mexico will ensure that the program is incorporated in an operations
and maintenance manual that would be subject to upgrading as conditions
warrant.</li>

<li>
The "Joint Report of the Principal Engineers Recommending the Distribution
of Costs Between the Two Countries for the Operation and Maintenance of
the Nuevo Laredo International Project Authorized in IBWC Minute No. 279,"

1997 is adopted, and forms an integral part of this Minute, as the agreement
for distribution between the two countries of the operation and maintenance
costs of the six principal elements of the jointly financed the international
sanitation project for the city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, required by
Resolution No. 8 of Commission Minute No.279, entitled "Joint Measures
to improve the quality of the waters of the Rio Grande at Laredo, Texas-Nuevo
Laredo, Tamaulipas," signed August 28, 1989.</li>

<li>
The administration by the Mexican Section of the United States funds will
include the involvement of Commission Engineers in: a) development of contracts
necessary for extraordinary maintenance and for capital improvements; b)
supervision of operations insofar as the operation and maintenance program
in the November 9, 1995 Joint Report, including site visits that both Sections
may consider necessary; c) the application of United States funds in the
operation and maintenance of the six elements agreed in IBWC Minute No.
279; and d) the annual review of progress made by the operating organization
in achieving the Mexican Government's goal of strengthening that organization's
capacity.</li>

<li>
All activities carried out pursuant to this Minute will be subject to the
availability of appropriated funds, resources and personnel and applicable
laws and regulations of each country.</li>

<li>
This Minute shall enter into force when the Government of the United States
of America and the Government of the United Mexican States have each provided
written notification through the IBWC of its approval.</li>

<h3>
Joint Report of the Principal Engineers<br>
Recommending the Distribution of Costs Between the Two<br>
Countries for the Operation and Maintenance of the Nuevo<br>
Laredo International Project Authorized in IBWC Minute No 279.</h3></center>
<b>May 30, 1997</b>
<br><b>Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Chih.To The Honorable Commissioners,</b>
<br><b>International Boundary and Water Commission</b>
<br><b>United States and Mexico</b>
<br><b>El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua</b>
<p><b>Sirs:</b>
<p>In accordance with your instructions, we respectfully submit for your
consideration this Joint Report recommending distribution between the two
countries of the operation and maintenance costs of the principal elements
of the jointly financed international sanitation project for the city of
Nuevo Laredo, Tam., authorized in Commission Minute No. 279, entitled,
"Joint Measures to Improve the Quality of the Waters of the Rio Grande
at Laredo, Texas / Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas," dated August 28, 1989.
<p><b>Background</b>
<p>We considered Resolution No. 4 of Minute No. 279 which establishes that
the Governments of the United States and Mexico will participate in the
financing of the construction, operation and maintenance of the six principal
elements that make up the international sanitation project. We took into
account Resolution No. 8 which stipulates that the Commission reach an
agreement on the division of these costs for the costs of operation and
maintenance of the principal elements of the jointly financed sanitation
project.
<p>We also took into consideration that the Commission adopted the terms
in the Joint Report of the Principal Engineers that forms a part of Minute
No. 279. That report establishes that for Mexico the standards for wastewaters
discharged to the Rio Grande from Nuevo Laredo are different than those
in the United States, such that the standards stipulated in Minute No.
279 would be applied to the Nuevo Laredo treatment plant discharges, provided
that the control measures necessary to meet such standards are jointly
financed by the governments of the United States and Mexico. Also, we considered
that the referenced Joint Report establishes that the cost to the United
States should correspond to the difference between the cost to Mexico of
operation and maintenance for Mexico to meet its national effluent standards
established for Nuevo Laredo, Tam. and the costs of operation and maintenance
necessary to meet the standards agreed to for the international plant in
the referenced Minute.
<p>Finally, we considered the information provided by the Mexican Section's
Principal Engineer that the policy of the Government of Mexico is one in
which municipalities will exercise greater responsibilities in financing
and carrying out the operation and maintenance of drinking water and wastewater
systems. As such, the Government of Mexico seeks to improve the capacity
of local sanitation systems operating organizations such that they will
be self-sufficient in their operation and maintenance of such systems.
Further, we considered that the discharge standards of the two countries
applicable to the Rio Grande in the area of Laredo - Nuevo Laredo may in
the future tend to be similar. Thus, we consider it advisable to strengthen
the Nuevo Laredo, Tam., operating organization so that this organization
may cover the costs that this effort implies. With this in mind, a practical
approach for a distribution of costs between the United States and Mexico,
would be that of distributing the cost participation of the United States
in a greater proportionate amount in the first few years and a lesser amount
in the second part of a 10 year period. Further, at the end of that period,
we recommend that the Commission review the cost distribution and make
recommendations regarding the difference between the discharges standards
applicable in Mexico for the Rio Grande in Nuevo Laredo and the standards
established in Minute No. 279. Further the Commission would review the
cost distribution against the capacity of the Operating Organization to
completely cover the cost of operating the plant.
<p><b>Distribution of Costs</b>
<p>We also observed that the six principal elements of the international
sanitation project, consisting of a) Riverside Collector, b) Coyotes I
Collector, c) Sewage Collection Expansion, d) Sewage Collection Rehabilitation,
e) Pumping Plant and f) Sewage Treatment Plant, were essentially completed
in July 1996. We also observed that costs for certain pre-operations and
maintenance activities were covered since 1995. We reviewed the summary
of costs, in the enclosed Table I, corresponding to the actual costs to
the Operating Organization from July through December 1996 for the treatment
and pumping plants and observed that the total was equivalent to $687,694
United States currency.
<p>We also observed that for the operation and maintenance of Sewage Collection
Expansion and Sewage Collection Rehabilitation principal elements, such
maintenance would be performed under Mexico's standards such that Mexico
would cover the total cost. However, we observed that there was a 25 per
cent increase in the construction costs of the Ribere&amp;ntildeo; and
Coyotes Collectors consistent with control measures necessary to meet the
discharge standards in Minute No.279. Correspondingly, the United States
could cover 25 per cent of the operation and maintenance costs of such
collectors. Also, we observed that certain additional features were added
to the pumping station element which also increased the construction costs
of the pumping station and the treatment plant elements in order to include
control measures necessary to meet the discharge standards in Minute No.
279. Thus the United States could cover an estimated 25 per cent of the
costs of the pumping station. However, the United States cost contribution
to the total operation and maintenance of all six principal elements should
not exceed 33.3 percent. Based on that experience we estimated that the
cost for the six elements for 1997 would be in the range of $1.12 to $1.99
million, United States currency.
<p>We reviewed the principles and costs referenced above using the basic
items shown in the enclosed Table I and, based on these, made a projection
of a range of the estimated total costs from 1998 through 2005, taking
into account increased sewage generation up to the plant capacity, assuming
simple annual increase of 10 per cent through 2005 over the estimated costs
for 1997 in the range of $1.12 to $1.99 million and arrived at an estimated
total cost range of from $15 million to $27.49 million for a 10 year period
through 2005. Accordingly, the United States share of the estimated total
cost using the lower estimate of the range is estimated at $5 million through
2005.
<p>Further, we took into account the Mexican Government's objective to
strengthen operating organizations and concluded that the operating organization
would need support in the earlier years of the operation and maintenance
while it undergoes capacity building. Accordingly we propose a distribution
of the United States contribution, based on actual costs, of $350,000 for
1996 and $700,000 for 1997 and based on an estimated total cost range of
from $15 million to $27.49 million for a 10 year period through 2005, as
well as the information of the United States Principal Engineer that his
country is not prepared to provide more than 33.3 per cent of the total
actual costs of the six principal elements in that period. Such United
States participation would be subject to review at the end of each year
against that actual cost incurred, including those that may be incurred
for contingencies, and the information provided to the IBWC by the Mexican
Section regarding the progress made in achieving the Mexican Government's
objective to strengthen the operating organization in Nuevo Laredo, Tam.
Based on this review, beginning in 1998, the estimated United States participation
will be determined in January of this and subsequent years.
<p><b>Implementation Procedures</b>
<p>We consider that the following procedures be used in implementing the
above proposed cost distribution:
<ol>
<li>
That the United States cover its assigned participation in the estimated
costs of operating and maintaining the six principal elements of the Nuevo
Laredo International Sanitation Project in the amounts of $350,000 in 1996
and $700,000 in 1997.</li>

<li>
That for the period from 1998 through 2005, the United States cover its
assigned participation in the estimated costs of operating and maintaining
the six principal elements of the Nuevo Laredo International Sanitation
Plant subject to review, for appropriate adjustments, at the end of each
year against the actual costs incurred, and the information provided to
the IBWC by the Mexican Section regarding the progress made in achieving
the Mexican Government's objective to strengthen the operating organization
in Nuevo Laredo, Tam. with the understandings in Points 3-6 below.</li>

<li>
That Mexico, through the Nuevo Laredo operating agency, cover the difference
between the actual costs of the international sanitation project through
2005 plant and the corresponding United States contribution, providing
to the United States, statements of actual costs for the basic items listed
on Table I indicating those costs to be covered with the United States
funds and those paid by Mexico over and above the United States contribution,
making the supporting documentation available to the IBWC.</li>

<li>
That upon the approval of this Joint Report, the United States Section
of the Commission provide to the Mexican Section of the Commission, the
initial contribution of $350,000 corresponding to 1996.</li>

<li>
That subsequently , the operating organization present to the Mexican Section
the necessary statement(s) of the international project's operation and
maintenance costs as they are incurred each month, for presentation to
the IBWC during the first 10 days of the following month in accordance
with Point 3, above.</li>

<li>
That the United States Section make payment through the Mexican Section
for the actual operation and maintenance costs presented in Point 5) above,
within the next days after these are presented through the Mexican Section,
in an amount that will not exceed a prorated monthly payment of the annual
corresponding United States contribution in effect for that year, using
the "buy" pesos for dollars rate of exchange in effect at the closing of
the last working day of the month in which the costs were incurred.</li>
</ol>
<b>Recommendations</b>
<p>We recommend that the IBWC, adopt the above described distribution of
costs and procedures for implementation as the agreement on the distribution
between the two countries of the operation and maintenance costs of the
principal elements of the jointly financed international sanitation project
for the city of Nuevo Laredo, Tam., required by Resolution No. 8 of IBWC
Minute No. 279, entitled, "Joint Measures to Improve the Quality of the
Waters of the Rio Grande at Laredo, Texas / Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas,"
dated August 28, 1989.

<br><b>El Paso, TexasJoint Report of the Principal Engineers</b>
<br><b>Concerning Recommendations for the Operation and</b>
<br><b>Maintenance of the International Project to Improve the</b>
<br><b>Quality of the Waters of the Rio Grande at</b>
<br><b>Laredo, Texas-Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas</b>
<br><b>Established in Minute No. 279</b></center>

<p><b>To The Honorable Commissioners</b>
<br><b>International Boundary and Water Commission</b>
<br><b>United States and Mexico</b>
<br><b>El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua</b>
<p><b>Sirs:</b>
<p>In accordance with your instructions, we respectfully submit for your
consideration, this joint report which proposes the specific activities
for the operation and maintenance of the international sanitation project
authorized in Commission Minute No. 279, entitled "Joint Measures to Improve
the Quality of the Waters of the Rio Grande at Laredo, Texas/Nuevo Laredo
Tamaulipas", signed and approved August 28, 1989.
<p>In this respect, we considered the requirement in Resolution No. 8 of
Minute No. 279 that the Commission reach an agreement on the division of
the operation and maintenance costs of the principal elements of the Nuevo
Laredo Sanitation Project before operation of the project begins. We also
note the requirement in Resolution No. 9 of Minute No. 279 that the operation
and maintenance of the project be under the direct control of the Mexican
Section of the Commission, and that the operation and maintenance be performed
in accordance with an operations and maintenance manual and specific program
recommended by the Commission and approved by the two Governments. Finally,
we considered Resolution No. 20 for industrial wastewater pre-treatment
to preserve the efficiency of the treatment plant contemplated in the sanitation
project.
<p><b><i>Description of the Works Undertaken in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas</i></b>
<p>We observe that the design and construction of the six principal elements
of the international sanitation project in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas authorized
in Minute No. 279 are nearing completion. These principal elements are:
a) Riverside Collector; b) Coyotes I Collector; c) Sewage Collection System
Expansion; d) Sewage Collection System Rehabilitation; e) Pumping Plant
and f) Treatment Plant. These were installed and constructed based on the
criteria established in Minute No. 279. We reviewed the construction criteria
and observed that the construction should be such that in the operation
and maintenance there should not be any discharges of untreated sewage
into the Rio Grande from the Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas sewage collection
system, and that the discharge into the Rio Grande from the Nuevo Laredo,
Tamaulipas treatment should not exceed the discharge limits established
in Minute No. 279.
<p>We observe that the works undertaken under Minute No. 279 were as follows:
<p><b>Riverside and Coyotes I Collectors</b>
<p>The Riverside and Coyotes I Collectors were constructed to ensure the
proper collection and conveyance of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas sewage to
the international treatment works.
<p>The Riverside Collector, located parallel to the Rio Grande, is 11 miles
(18.3 kilometers (km)) long and varies in pipe diameter from 18 inches
(45 centimeters (cm)) at the upper end to 72 inches (183 cm) at the lower
end. The pipe diameters were up sized to assure that the collector has
additional capacity to accommodate the city's future expansion. The collector
will intercept and convey the sewage to a junction box located at the pumping
station site.
<p>The Coyote I Collector was constructed parallel to the Arroyo del Coyote
to intercept and convey sewage from the collection system in the southern
part of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas to the junction box. It extends for 5
miles (8.7 km) long and varies in pipe diameter from 12 inches (30 cm)
at the upper end to 48 inches (122 cm) at the junction box.
<p><b>Expansion of Sewage Collection System</b>
<p>Several areas of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas did not have any collection
system, which resulted in discharges of residential sewage to nearby arroyos
via open street flow, which eventually flowed to the Rio Grande. A total
of 31 miles (49.8 km) of pipeline ranging in size from 6 inches (15 cm)
to 24 inches (60 cm) was installed. Interconnection of residential lines
to the Riverside and Coyote I Collector system was included in the project.
<p><b>Rehabilitation of Sewage Collection System</b>
<p>Portions of the Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas sewage collection system are
about 50 years old and have deteriorated to the point of collapsing. Rehabilitation
of the sewage collection system was undertaken. Minute No. 279 envisioned
rehabilitation of 23 specific sites, but for the most part the entire system
required repairs or replacement. A total of 4 miles (6.7 km) of pipe was
installed of varying in pipe diameters from 15 inches (38 cm) to 36 inches
(91 cm).
<p><b>Pumping Station</b>
<p>The pumping station consists of two separate wet wells, each having
an inside diameter of 33 feet (10 meters) and 49 feet (15 meters) in depth.
Each wet well will be equipped with three (3) 14 million gallons per day
(mgd) or 600 liters per second (1ps) submersible pumps and 281 hp motors.
Each wet well has the capacity to pump to the treatment plant design capacity
of 31 mgd (1360 lps). The two wet wells will be fed by the Riverside and
Coyote I Collectors via a junction box.
<p><b>Treatment Plant</b>
<p>The Nuevo Laredo International Wastewater Treatment Plant (NLIWTP) is
an oxidation ditch vertical turbine aerator (carrousel) type facility designed
to provide secondary treatment to 31 mgd (1360 lps) at Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas.
Location of the discharge point at the confluence of the Arroyo del Coyote
and the Rio Grande is at 27.0 25' 01" north latitude and 99.0 29' 23" east
longitude. Influent is from a pumping station constructed along the left
bank of the Arroyo del Coyote which takes the flows arriving at a junction
box from the Riverside and Coyote I Collectors. The Arroyo del Coyote is
crossed by two 42-inch (106 cm) steel reinforced concrete cylinder force
mains. The NLIWTP consists of a headworks structure containing two mechanical
and a manual bar screens and two grit removal basins, six oxidation ditches
with mechanical surface aerators, four clarifiers, chlorine disinfection
facilities, effluent flow metering devices and a cascade aeration outfall
to the Arroyo del Coyote. Sludge facilities include a return sludge pump
station, aerated sludge holding tanks, waste sludge pumps, and 80 sludge
drying beds. Other NLIWTP facilities include a potable and non-potable
water system, an administration, maintenance and electrical building, standby
generating facilities, a guard house, perimeter fencing and landscaping.
<p><b><i>Description of the Works Undertaken in Laredo, Texas</i></b>
<p>We observe that the City of Laredo, Texas collects all of the existing
sewage load and provides secondary treatment before discharge to the Rio
Grande. Treatment is provided by two plants with a capacity totaling 11
mgd ( 486 lps) which discharge to the Rio Grande. The first plant, Zacate
Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, is an 8 mgd (350 lps) activated sludge/trickling
filter facility located at the confluence of Zacate Creek and the Rio Grande
about 0.5 mile (0.8 km) downstream of the Juarez/Lincoln International
Bridge. The second plant, Laredo Southside Wastewater Treatment Plant,
is a 3 mgd (131 lps) oxidation ditch facility located about 3 miles (5
km) south of the City of Laredo, Texas on the left bank of the Rio Grande.
The effluents from these treatment plants are disinfected prior to discharge
to the Rio Grande. The City of Laredo, Texas carries out a continuous operation
and maintenance program to ensure compliance with United States effluent
standards and surface water quality standards of the river. The City plans
to increase its treatment capacity, as needed to keep ahead of the growing
sewage load.
<p><b><i>Criteria for Operation and Maintenance of the Laredo, Texas and
Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas Systems</i></b>
<p>The City of Laredo, Texas operates and maintains its system in accordance
with an operating plan and operations and maintenance manuals that comply
with applicable laws in the United States, which as a minimum comply with
criteria listed below. This information is available to the Commission.
The Operating Agency for the Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas system will adopt
an operating plan and operations and maintenance manual, also made available
to the Commission, utilizing, applicable criteria in Mexico analyzed along
with those for equipment installed at the plant that also, as a minimum,
meet the criteria listed below:
<dl>
<dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<b>Pumping and Treatment System</b></dd>

<dd>
We observed appropriateness of operating and maintaining these elements
through the operating agency directly or through contract or other means
considered adequate to ensure discharges from the treatment facilities
comply with the standards established in Minute No. 279, and in accordance
with an operation and maintenance manuals adopted for this purpose considering
the general criteria below:</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
a.</dt>

<dd>

primary electricity facilities for the treatment systems and electro-mechanic
components, including a schedule for preventative maintenance and availability
on site of spare parts for such maintenance.</dd>

<dt>
e.</dt>

<dd>
<b>Sludge</b> -- Dispose of the sludge at sites outside the Rio Grande
floodplain or its tributaries in accordance with standards in force in
the respective country.</dd>
</dl>
<b><i>Commission Supervision</i></b>
<p>We consider it appropriate that each Section of the Commission ensure
that the operating organizations responsible for the operation and maintenance
of the treatment systems in Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas
have available to the respective Section of the Commission quarterly reports
on maintenance work effected including, the costs of operation and maintenance
that requires use of international funds.
<p>Also, we suggest that Commission personnel through their personnel at
the Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas offices carry out the following
activities:
<ol>
<li>
Systematic inspections based on mutual accord and coordinated through the
respective Section of the Commission.</li>

<li>
Notify the Principal Engineers on sewage spills that may discharge to the
Rio Grande and necessary corrective measures.</li>

<li>
A quarterly report on work carried out with observations and where appropriate,
recommendations on matters affecting payments with international funds.</li>

<li>
Monthly reports of activities involving treatment, operation and maintenance,
including monitoring of the water quality identifying problems observed
and making recommendations to prevent them or resolve them.</li>
</ol>

<dd>
<b>Industrial Wastes Controls</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>A.</b></dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<b>Preservation of Treatment</b></dd>

<dd>
We observe that Resolution No. 20 of Minute No. 279 requires that all industries
that discharge wastewater to the sewage collection system provide adequate
pre-treatment to ensure the efficiency of the treatment system. For this
purpose, the operating organization will develop a program for control
of discharges by industries in Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas
based on the standards it its respective country.</dd>

<dd>
<b>B.</b></dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<b>Characterization of Influent and Effluent</b></dd>

<dd>
We consider that semi-annual monitoring is sufficient to characterize the
effluent and influent at the treatment works and to detect any dissolved
and total constituents that exceed pollution concentration limits that
inhibit biological treatment processes which will cause or contribute to
a less effective treatment. The Commission will support the operating agency
with strengthening its analytical capacity for those parameters that require
more frequency.</dd>

<dd>
We thus recommend, that in addition to the systematic monitoring of conventional
pollutants and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Nitrogen, Nitrogen with
Ammonia, Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and pH, the influent be monitored
semi-annually for non-conventional contaminants that may inhibit the biological
treatment processes that cause or contribute to a less effective treatment.
These contaminants include arsenic, chromium (total), copper cyanide, lead,
nickel and zinc.</dd>

<dd>
<b>C.</b></dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<b>Additional Monitoring in Case of Exceedence</b></dd>

<dd>
We recommend that if an analysis of the influent concentrations or effluent
loadings indicate an exceedence of standards, monitoring should be increased
to once a month until such time as analyses demonstrate three months of
acceptable levels, at which time, frequency should revert to semi-annual.</dd>

<dd>
We recommend that in cases where the standard is exceeded the operating
agency of the treatment system, immediately begin an investigation of the
source and in accordance with the special discharge conditions and define
the corresponding corrective actions.</dd>

<dd>
<b><i>Distribution of Costs</i></b></dd>

<dd>
We observe the requirement in Resolution No. 8 of Minute No. 279 that the
Commission reach an agreement on the division of the operation and maintenance
costs of the principal elements of the Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas sanitation
project before operation of the project begins. Further, we note that the
Joint Report of the Principal Engineers that forms a part of Minute No.
279, recognized that the cost to the United States should correspond to
the difference between the operation and maintenance cost to Mexico to
meet its national effluent standards established for Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas
and the cost of operation and maintenance necessary to meet the effluent
standards adopted in Minute No. 279 for the NLIWTP.</dd>

<dd>
We consider it appropriate that the Principal Engineers, together with
the operating organization, develop a specific program for distribution
of operation and maintenance costs of the sewage system following the above
principles with the goal of establishing, before the international project
is in operation, a specific program of needs and distribution of costs
for the first year and a general program for the next five years.</dd>

<dd>
<b><i>Recommendations</i></b></dd>

<dd>
Based on the above consideration, we respectfully recommend:</dd>

<li>
The Commission adopt the criteria described above, for operation and maintenance
of the six principal elements of the Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas International
Sanitation Project authorized in Commission Minute No. 279, "Joint Measures
to Improve the Quality of the Waters of the Rio Grande at Laredo, Texas/Nuevo
Laredo, Tamaulipas", dated August 28, 1989 to comply with Resolution No.
8 of Minute No. 279.</li>

<li>
The Commission adopt the bases described in distribution of costs section
of this report whereby the Principal Engineers develop the specific distribution
of costs and procedures for administration of United States and Mexican
funds.</li>

<p><br>Respectfully,
<br>&nbsp;
