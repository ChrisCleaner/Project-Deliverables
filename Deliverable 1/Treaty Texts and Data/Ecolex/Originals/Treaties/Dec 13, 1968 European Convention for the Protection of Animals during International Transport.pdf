EUROPEAN CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANIMALS 
DURING INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT

Adopted at Paris on 13 December 1968

The member States of the Council of Europe signatory 
hereto,

Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is 
to achieve a greater unity between its Members for the 
purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and 
principles which are their common heritage;

Convinced that the requirements of the international 
transport of animals are not incompatible with the 
welfare of the animals;

Animated by the desire to safeguard, as far as 
possible, animals in transport from suffering;

Considering that progress in this respect may be 
achieved through the adoption of common provisions 
regarding the international transport of animals,

Have agreed as follows:



Chapter I


Article 1

1. Each Contracting Party shall apply the provisions 
governing the international transport of animals 
contained in this Convention.

2. For the purposes of this Convention international 
transport is understood to be any movement which 
involves the crossing of a frontier. Frontier traffic 
shall, however, be excluded.

3. The competent authorities of the country of dispatch 
shall decide whether the transport is in conformity 
with the provisions of this Convention. Nevertheless, 
the country of destination or intermediate countries 
may dispute whether any particular transport conforms 
with the provisions of this Convention. Such a 
consignment shall, however, be detained only when it is 
strictly necessary for the welfare of the animals.

4. Each Contracting Party take the necessary measures 
to avoid or reduce to a minimum the suffering of 
animals in cases when strikes or other unforeseeable 
circumstances in its territory impede the strict 
application of the provisions of this Convention. It 
will be guided for this purpose by the principles set 
out in this Convention.


Article 2

This Convention applies to the international transport 
of:

a) domestic solipeds and domestic animals of the 
bovine, ovine, caprine and porcine species (Chapter 
II);

b) domestic birds and domestic rabbits (Chapter III);

c) domestic dogs and domestic cats (Chapter IV); 

d) other mammals and birds (Chapter V);

e) cold-blooded animals (Chapter VI).



Chapter II

A. GENERAL PROVISIONS


Article 3

1. Before animals are loaded for international 
transport they shall be inspected by an authorised

satisfy himself that they are fit for transportation. 
For the purposes of this Convention an authorised 
veterinary officer is understood to be a veterinary 
officer nominated by the competent authority.

2. Loading shall be carried out under arrangements 
approved by an authorised veterinary officer.

3. The authorised veterinary officer shall issue a 
certificate which identifies the animals, states that 
they are fit for transportation, and, where possible, 
records the registration number of the means of 
transport and the type of vehicle used.

4. In certain cases determined by agreement between the 
Contracting Parties concerned the provisions of this 
Article need not apply.


Article 4

Animals likely to give birth during carriage or having 
given birth during the preceding 48 hours shall not be 
considered fit for transportation.


Article 5

The authorised veterinary officer of the exporting 
country, country of transit, or importing country may 
prescribe a period of rest, at a place determined by 
him, during which the animals shall receive the 
necessary care.

1. Animals shall be provided with adequate space and, 
unless special conditions require to the contrary, room 
to lie down.

constructed so as to protect animals against inclement 
weather conditions and marked differences in climate 
conditions. Ventilation and air space shall be adapted 
to the conditions of transport and be appropriate for 
the species of animals carried.

3. Containers in which animals are transported shall be 
marked with a symbol indicating the presence of live 
animals and a sign indicating the upright position. 
Containers shall be easy to clean, escape-proof and 
shall be so constructed as to ensure the safety of the 
animals. Containers shall also allow for the inspection 
and care of the animals and shall be stowed in a way 
which does not interfere with ventilation. During 
transport and handling, containers shall always be kept 
upright and shall not be exposed to severe jolts or 
shaking.

4. During transport animals shall be offered water and 
appropriate food at suitable intervals. Animals shall 
not be left more than 24 hours without being fed and

provision need not apply to unbroken animals.

their hind feet unshod.

8. Bulls over 18 months should preferably be tied. They

measures shall be taken to avoid adverse reactions 
which might result from the transport in the same 
consignment of species naturally hostile to each other. 
When animals of different ages are carried in the same 
truck, vehicle, vessel, or aircraft adult and young 
animals shall be kept separate; this restriction shall 
not, however, apply to females travelling with their 
young which they suckle. With regard to bovine, soliped 
and porcine animals, mature uncastrated males shall be 
separated from females. Adult boars shall also be 
separated from each other; this shall also apply to 
stallions.

horns or legs during loading or unloading.

different way presenting at least the same advantages.
