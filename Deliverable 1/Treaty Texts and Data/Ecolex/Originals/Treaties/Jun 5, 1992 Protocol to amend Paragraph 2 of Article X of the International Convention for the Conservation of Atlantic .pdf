Each Contracting party shall contribute annually to the budget of the Commission an amount calculated in accordance with a scheme provided for in the Financial Regulations, as adopted by the Commission. The Commission, in adopting this scheme, should consider inter alia each Contracting Party's fixed basic fees for Commission and Panel membership, the total round weight of catch and net weight of canned products of Atlantic tuna and tuna-like fishes and the degree of economic development of the Contracting Parties."
"The scheme of annual contributions in the Financial Regulations shall be established or modified only through the agreement of all the Contracting Parties present and voting. The Contracting Parties shall be informed of this ninety days in advance."

ARTICLE 2
The original of this Protocol, the English, French and Spanish texts of which are equally authentic, shall be deposited with the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. It shall be open for signature in Madrid on June 5, 1992 and thereafter in Rome.
