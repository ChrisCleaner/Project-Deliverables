INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON OIL POLLUTION PREPAREDNESS, RESPONSE AND
CO-OPERATION, 1990

Adopted at London on 30 November 1990


THE PARTIES TO THE PRESENT CONVENTION.

      CONSCIOUS of the need to preserve the human environment in
general and the marine environment in particular,

      RECOGNIZING the serious threat posed to the marine environment
by oil pollution incidents involving ships, offshore units, sea ports
and oil handling facilities,

      MINDFUL of the importance of precautionary measures and
prevention in avoiding oil pollution in the first instance, and the
need for strict application of existing international instruments
dealing with maritime safety and marine pollution prevention,
particularly the International Convention for the Safety of Life at
Sea, 1974, as amended, and the International Convention for the
Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol
of 1978 relating thereto, as amended, and also the speedy development
of enhanced standards for the design, operation and maintenance of
ships carrying oil, and of offshore units,

      MINDFUL ALSO that, in the event of an oil pollution incident,
prompt and effective action is essential in order to minimize the
damage which may result from such an accident.

      EMPHASIZING the importance of effective preparation for combating
oil pollution incidents and the important role which the oil and
shipping industries have in this regard,

      RECOGNIZING FURTHER the importance of mutual assistance and
international co-operation relating to matters including the exchange
of information respecting the capabilities of States to respond to oil
pollution incidents, the preparation of oil pollution contingency
plans, the exchange of reports of incidents of significance which may
affect the marine environment or the coastline and related interests
of States, and research and development respecting means of combating
oil pollution in the marine environment,

      TAKING ACCOUNT of the "polluter pays" principle as a general
principle of international environmental law,

      TAKING ACCOUNT ALSO of the importance of international
instruments on liability and compensation for oil pollution damage,
including the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil
Pollution Damage (CLC); and the 1971 International Convention on the
Establishment of an international Fund for Compensation for Oil
Pollution Damage (FUND); and the compelling need for early entry into
force of the 1984 Protocols to the CLC and FUND Conventions,

      TAKING ACCOUNT FURTHER of the importance of bilateral and
multilateral agreements and arrangements including regional
conventions agreements,

      BEARING IN MIND the relevant provisions of the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea, in particular of its part XII,

      BEING AWARE of the need to promote international co-operation and
to enhance existing national, regional and global capabilities
concerning oil pollution preparedness and response, taking into
account the special needs of the developing countries and particularly
small island States,

      CONSIDERING that these objectives nay best be achieved by the
conclusion of an International Convention on Oil Pollution
Preparedness, Response and Co-operation,

ANNEX

REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS OF ASSISTANCE

(a)   Unless an agreement concerning the financial arrangements
governing actions of Parties to deal with oil pollution incidents has
been concluded on a bilateral or multilateral basis prior to the oil
pollution incident, Parties shall bear the costs of their respective
actions in dealing with pollution in accordance with sub-paragraph (i)
or sub-paragraph (ii).

      (i)  If the action was taken by one Party at the express request
           of another Party, the requesting Party shall reimburse to
           the assisting Party the cost of its action.  The requesting
           Party may cancel its request at any time, but in that case
           it shall bear the costs already incurred or committed by the
           assisting Party.

      (ii) If the action was taken by a Party on its own initiative
           this Party shall bear the costs of its action.

(b)   The principles laid down in sub-paragraph (a) shall apply unless
the Parties concerned otherwise agree in any individual case.

(2)   Unless otherwise agreed, the costs of action taken by a Party  
at the request of another Party shall be fairly calculated according
to the law and current practice of the assisting Party concerning the
reimbursement of such costs,

(3)   The Party requesting assistance and the assisting Party shall,
where appropriate, co-operate in concluding any action in response to
a compensation claim.  To that end, they shall give due consideration
to existing legal regimes.  Where the action thus concluded does not
permit full compensation for expenses incurred in the assistance
operation, the Party requesting assistance may ask the assisting Party
to waive reimbursement of the expenses exceeding the sums compensated
or to reduce the costs which have been calculated in accordance with
paragraph (2).  It may also request a postponement of the
reimbursement of such costs. In considering such a request, assisting
Parties shall give due consideration to the needs of the developing
countries.

(4)   The provisions of this Convention shall not be interpreted as in
any way  prejudicing the rights of Parties to recover from third
parties the costs of actions to deal with pollution or the threat of
pollution under other applicable provisions and rules of national and
international law.  Special attention shall be paid to the 1969
International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage
and the 1971 International Convention on the Establishment of an
International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage or any
subsequent amendment to those Conventions.
