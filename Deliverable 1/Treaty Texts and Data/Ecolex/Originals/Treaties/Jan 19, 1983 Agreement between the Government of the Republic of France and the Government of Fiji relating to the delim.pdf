<blockquote ALIGN="CENTER"><b>Article 1</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>The delimitation between the economic zone of the Republic
of France around the territories of New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna
and the exclusive economic zone of Fiji is based on the line of equidistance,
with certain minor divergencies for administrative convenience. The line
has been determined by using the nearest points of the baselines from which
the territorial sea of each country is measured. In the case of France,
the baseline is drawn in conformity with the Acts of 24th December 1971
and 28th December 1976. In the case of Fiji, the baseline is the archipelagic
baseline drawn in accordance with the Fiji Marine Spaces Act of 15th December
1977.</blockquote>
