<p>PROTOCOL establishing the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution
provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Government
of the Democratic Republic of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
on fishing off the coast of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe for
the period 1 June 1996 to 31 May 1999 (1)
<p>Article 1
<br>For the period of three years from 1 June 1996, the fishing rights
granted pursuant to Article 2 of the Agreement shall be 37 freezer tuna
seiners, seven pole-and-line tuna vessels and 25 surface long-liners.
<p>Article 2
<br>1. The financial compensation referred to in Article 6 of the Agreement
shall be, for the period referred to in Article 1, ECU 1 800 000, payable
in three equal annual instalments. That amount shall cover an annual catch
of 9 000 tonnes in S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe waters. If
the tuna caught by Community vessels in S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
waters exceeds that weight, the abovementioned amount shall be increased
by ECU 50 for each additional tonne caught.
<br>2. The use to which this compensation is put shall be the sole responsibility
of the Government of the Democratic Republic of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;
e Pr&iacute;ncipe. It shall be paid into an account with the National Bank
of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe.
<p>Article 3
<br>1. In addition to the amount referred to in Article 2, the Community
shall finance, during the period referred to in Article 1, scientific and
technical programmes to improve biological and fishery resource information
as regards the exclusive economic zone of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
up to an amount of ECU 187 500.
<br>2. These programmes shall be drawn up jointly by the competent authorities
of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe and the Community, which will,
if necessary, participate in their implementation. Once the content of
the programmes has been approved, they shall be financed by payments into
an account indicated by the competent authorities of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;
e Pr&iacute;ncipe.
<br>3. The competent authorities of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
shall send to the Commission of the European Communities a report on the
implementation of the approved programmes and the results obtained. The
Commission of the European Communities reserves the right to request any
further scientific information from the authorities of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;
e Pr&iacute;ncipe.
<p>Article 4
<br>1. The two Parties agree that improving the skills and knowledge of
those involved in sea fishing is a vital element in the success of their
cooperation. To that end, the Community shall, in addition to the amount
referred to in Article 2:
<br>(a) make it easier for nationals of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
to find places in establishments in its Member States and shall provide
for that purpose awards for study and practical training in the various
scientific, technical and economic disciplines relating to fisheries. These
awards may also be used up to an amount of ECU 35 000 in any State linked
to the Community by a Cooperation Agreement;
<br>(b) cover S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe's participation
in the Regional Fisheries Committee for the Gulf of Guinea and ICCAT up
to an amount of ECU 90 000;
<br>(c) bear the costs of participation in international meetings or training
courses on fisheries up to an amount of ECU 62 500.
<br>2. These sums shall be paid into the account indicated by the Ministry
of Agriculture and Fisheries in three equal annual instalments. That Ministry
shall manage all the measures financed in this way referred to in paragraph
1 and shall submit to the Commission a detailed report on the use made
of these funds.
<p>Article 5
<br>Should the Community fail to make the payments provided for in Articles
2 and 3, the application of this Protocol may be suspended.
<p>Article 6
<br>The Annex to the Agreement between the European Community and the Government
of the Democratic Republic of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
on fishing off the coast of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe is
hereby repealed and replaced by the Annex to this Protocol.
<p>Article 7
<br>This Protocol shall enter into force on the date on which it is signed.
<br>It shall apply from 1 June 1996.
<p>(1) See Decision 96/623/EC (OJ No L 279, 31. 10. 1996, p. 30).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>ANNEX
<p>Conditions for the exercise of fishing activities by Community vessels
in S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe fishing zone
<br>1. The procedure for applications for, and issue of, the licences referred
to in Article 4 of the Agreement shall be as follows:
<br>The relevant Community authorities shall present to the Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe,
via the Commission Delegation responsible for S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e
Pr&iacute;ncipe, an application for each vessel that wishes to fish under
the Agreement, as least 20 days before the date of commencement of the
period of validity requested.
<br>The applications shall be made on the forms provided for that purpose
by the Government of the Democratic Republic of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;
e Pr&iacute;ncipe, a specimen of which is attached hereto (Appendix 1).
<br>Licences shall be issued by the S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
authorities within 20 days of submission of the application to the shipowners
or their representatives via the Delegation of the Commission of the European
Communities responsible for S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe.
<br>Licences shall be issued for a specific vessel and shall not be transferable.
However, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities,
a vessel's licence may, and where force majeure is proved, shall, be replaced
by a new licence for another vessel whose features are similar to those
of the first vessel. The owner of the first vessel shall return the cancelled
licence to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;
e Pr&iacute;ncipe via the Delegation of the Commission of the European
Communities responsible for S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe.
<br>The new licence shall indicate:
<br>- the date of issue,
<br>- the fact that this licence replaces that of the first vessel, for
the period of validity remaining.
<br>In this case, no new lump sum as laid down in paragraph 5 shall be
due.
<br>The licence must be on board at all times; however, on receipt of notification
of payment of the advance sent to the S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
authorities by the European Commission, the vessel shall be entered on
a list of vessels authorized to fish, which shall be sent to the S&atilde;o
Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe authorities responsibilities for fisheries
inspection. Pending receipt of the licence, a copy may be obtained by fax
and should be kept on board.
<br>2. Licences shall be valid for one year and shall be renewable.
<br>3. The fees provided for in Article 4 of the Agreement shall be set
at ECU 20 per tonne caught in S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
fishing zone.
<br>4. The competent authorities of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
shall indicate the detailed rules for payment of the fees, in particular
the bank accounts and currencies to be used.
<br>5. Licences shall be issued following payment to the National Bank
of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe of a lump sum of ECU 3 000
for each freezer tuna seiner per year and ECU 500 for each pole-and-line
tuna vessel or surface long-liner per year, equivalent to the fees for:
<br>- 150 tonnes of tuna caught per freezer tuna seiner per year,
<br>- 25 tonnes of tuna caught per pole-and-line tuna vessel or surface
long-liner per year.
<br>6. A fishing log in accordance with the ICCAT model in Annex 2 shall
be kept on vessels for each fishing period spent in S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;
e Pr&iacute;ncipe's waters. It shall be filled in even when no catches
are made.
<br>The words 'Outside S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe's EEZ`
shall be entered in the abovementioned log-book in respect of periods during
which the said vessels are not in S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
waters.
<br>The log-books referred to in this paragraph shall be sent to the Ministry
of Agriculture and Fisheries within 15 working days of vessels arriving
in a port.
<br>Copies of these documents shall be sent to the scientific institutes
referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 7 below and to the Delegation
of the Commission of the European Communities responsible for S&atilde;o
Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe.
<br>7. The S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe authorities shall draw
up the statement of fees due for the past calendar year on the basis of
the catch declarations for each Community vessel and of any other information
in their possession.
<br>The previous year's statement shall reach the Commission by 31 March
which shall forward it simultaneously to the shipowners and national authorities
of the Member States concerned by 15 April.
<br>Where the shipowners dispute the statement presented by S&atilde;o
Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe they may request the relevant scientific
institutes, e.g. France's Institut de la Recherche Scientifique at Technique
d'Outre-Mer (ORSTOM) and the Instituto Espa&ntilde;ol de Oceanografia (IEO),
to verify the catch data before consulting with the S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;
e Pr&iacute;ncipe authorities with a view to drawing up the final statement
by 15 May of the current year. In the absence of any observations from
the shipowners by that date, the statement drawn up by the S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;
e Pr&iacute;ncipe authorities shall be deemed final. Member States shall
forward to the Commission the final statements relating to their own fleets.
<br>Any payment due in addition to the advance shall be made by the shipowners
to the National Bank of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe no later
than 31 May of that year.
<br>However, if the amount of the final statement is lower than the advance
referred to in paragraph 5, the resulting balance shall not be reimbursable
to the shipowner.
<br>8. Within three hours of entering or leaving the zone and every three
days during their fishing activities in S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe's
waters, vessels shall be obliged to communicate their position and the
volume of the catch on board direct to the S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
authorities preferably by fax or, failing that, by radio in the case of
vessels not equipped with fax.
<br>The fax number and radio frequency shall be notified on issue of the
licence.
<br>A copy of the fax messages or of the record of radio communications
shall be kept by the S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe authorities
and the shipowners until both parties have approved the final statement
of fees referred to in paragraph 7.
<br>A vessel caught fishing without having notified the S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;
e Pr&iacute;ncipe authorities of its presence shall be considered an unlicensed
vessel.
<br>9. Tuna seiners shall endeavour to make any by-catches available to
the S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe authorities at prices fixed
by mutual agreement.
<br>10. Vessels shall allow on board observers at the request of the authorities
of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe. Observers must not remain
on board for longer than needed to carry out spot checks on the catch.
The master of the vessel shall take all necessary steps to facilitate the
task of the observers on board. The salary and the social security contributions
of the observer shall be borne by the competent authorities of S&atilde;o
Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe. Should the observer be taken on board in
a foreign port, his travelling costs shall be borne by the shipowner. Should
a vessel with an observer from S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe
on board leave the S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe fishing zone,
all measures must be taken to ensure the observer's return to S&atilde;o
Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe as soon as possible at the expense of the
shipowner.
<br>At the request of the authorities of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe,
owners of tuna fishing vessels shall endeavour to sign on three S&atilde;o
Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe seamen for all the Community tuna seiners,
all such seamen to be assigned to different vessels. The conditions of
employment and remuneration shall be fixed by mutual agreement between
the shipowners and representatives of the seamen.
<br>11. The international standards on tuna fishing as recommended by ICCAT
shall apply.
<br>12. The Delegation of the Commission of the European Communities responsible
for S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe shall be notified within 48
hours of any boarding within S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe's
fishing zone of a fishing vessel flying the flag of a Member State of the
Community and operating under this Agreement.
<br>A brief report of the circumstances and reasons leading to the boarding
shall be submitted within 72 hours.
