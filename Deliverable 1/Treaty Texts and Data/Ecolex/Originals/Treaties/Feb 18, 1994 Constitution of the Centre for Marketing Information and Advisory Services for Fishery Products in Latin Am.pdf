CONSTITUTION OF THE CENTRE FOR MARKETING INFORMATION

IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (INFOPESCA)
 
PREAMBLE
The Contracting Parties,
Conscious of the importance of fisheries and aquaculture for the development of 
the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean;
Recognizing that the majority of the countries of Latin America and the 
Caribbean would gain significantly from the development of their fishery sectors

advisory service on the international fishery market, thereby better balancing 
market supply, promoting a more advantageous price structure and stimulating a 
more appropriate use of fishery resources;
Conscious that the promotion and success of such results can be accelerated 
through regional cooperation;
Considering that the best means of achieving such cooperation is to establish an 
intergovernmental organization that conducts its activities in collaboration 
with States, other intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental 
organizations, institutions and private enterprises that may be able to provide 
financial and technical support;
Have agreed to establish the Centre for Marketing Information and Advisory
