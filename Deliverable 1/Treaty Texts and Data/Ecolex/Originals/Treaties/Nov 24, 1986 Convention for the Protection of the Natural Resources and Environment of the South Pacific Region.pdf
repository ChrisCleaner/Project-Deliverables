CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AND 
ENVIRONMENT OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC REGION

Adopted at Noumea on 24 November 1986

   The Parties,

   Fully aware of the economic and social value of the natural 
resources of the environment of the South Pacific Region;

   Taking into account the traditions and cultures of the Pacific 
people as expressed in accepted customs and practices;

   Conscious of their responsibility to preserve their natural 
heritage for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future 
generations;

   Recognizing the special hydrological, geological and 
ecological characteristics of the region which requires special 
care and responsible management;

   Recognizing further the threat to the marine and coastal 
environment, its ecological equilibrium, resources and legitimate 
uses posed by pollution and by the insufficient integration of an 
environmental dimension into the development process;

   Seeking to ensure that resource development shall be in 
harmony with the maintenance of the unique environmental quality 
of the region and the evolving principles of sustained resource 
management;

   Realizing fully the need for co-operation amongst themselves 
and with competent international, regional and sub-regional 
organizations in order to ensure a co-ordinated and comprehensive 
development of the natural resources of the region;

   Recognizing the desirability for the wider acceptance and 
national implementation of international agreements already in 
existence concerning the marine and coastal environment;

   Noting, however, that existing international agreements 
concerning the marine and coastal environment do not cover, in 
spite of the progress achieved, all aspects and sources of marine 
pollution and environmental degradation and do not entirely meet 
the special requirements of the South Pacific Region;

   Desirous to adopt the regional convention to strengthen the 
implementation of the general objective of the Action Plan for 
Managing the Natural Resources and Environment of the South 
Pacific Region adopted at Rarotonga, Cook Islands, on 11 March

Annex on arbitration


Article 1

   Unless the agreement referred to in Article 26 of the 
Convention provides otherwise, the arbitration procedure shall be 
in accordance with the rules set out in this Annex.


Article 2

   The claimant Party shall notify the Organisation that the 
Parties have agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration pursuant 
to paragraph 2, or that paragraph 3 of Article 26 of the 
Convention is applicable. The notification shall state the subject 
matter of the arbitration and include the provisions of the 
Convention or any Protocol thereto, the interpretation or 
application of which is the subject of disagreement. The 
Organisation shall transmit this information to all Parties to the 
Convention or Protocol concerned.


Article 3

1. The Tribunal shall consist of a single arbitrator if so agreed 
between the Parties to the dispute within thirty days from the 
date of receipt of the notification for arbitration.

2. In the case of the death, disability or default of the 
arbitrator, the Parties to a dispute may agree upon a replacement 
within thirty days of such death, disability or default.


Article 4

1. Where the Parties to a dispute do not agree upon a Tribunal in 
accordance with Article 3 of this Annex, the Tribunal shall 
consist of three members:

    (i)  one arbitrator nominated by each Party to the dispute,

    (ii) a third arbitrator who shall be nominated by agreement 
         between the two first named and who shall act as its Chairman.

2. If the Chairman of a Tribunal is not nominated within thirty 
days of nomination of the second arbitrator, the Parties to a 
dispute shall, upon the request of one Party, submit to the 
Secretary-General of the Organisation within a further period of 
thirty days, an agreed list of qualified persons. The 
Secretary-General shall select the Chairman from such list as soon 
as possible. He shall not select a Chairman who is, or has been, a 
national of one Party to the dispute except with the consent of 
the other Party to the dispute.

3. If one Party to a dispute fails to nominate an arbitrator as 
provided in subparagraph l(i) within sixty days from the date of 
receipt of the notification for arbitration, the other Party may 
request the submission to the Secretary-General of the 
Organisation within a period of thirty days of an agreed list of 
qualified persons. The Secretary-General shall select the Chairman 
of the Tribunal from such list as soon as possible. The Chairman 
shall then request the Party which has not nominated an arbitrator 
to do so. If this Party does not nominate an arbitrator within 
fifteen days of such request, the Secretary-General shall, upon 
request of the Chairman, nominate the arbitrator from the agreed 
list of qualified persons.

4. In the case of the death, disability or default of an 
arbitrator, the Party to the dispute who nominated him shall 
nominate a replacement within thirty days of such death, 
disability or default. If the Party does not nominate a 
replacement, the arbitration shall proceed with the remaining 
arbitrators. In the case of the death, disability or default of 
the Chairman, a replacement shall be nominated in accordance with 
paragraphs 1(ii) and 2 within ninety days of such death, 
disability or default.

5. A list of arbitrators shall be maintained by the 
Secretary-General of the Organisation and composed of qualified 
persons nominated by the Parties. Each Party may designate for 
inclusion in the list four persons who shall not necessarily be 
its nationals. If the Parties to the dispute have failed within 
the specified time limits to submit to the Secretary-General an 
agreed list of qualified persons as provided for in paragraphs 2, 
3 and 4, the Secretary-General shall select from the list 
maintained by him the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet nominated.


Article 5

   The Tribunal may hear and determine counter-claims arising 
directly out of the subject matter of the dispute.


Article 6

   The Tribunal may, at the request of one of the Parties to the 
dispute, recommend interim measures of protection.


Article 7

   Each Party to the dispute shall be responsible for the costs 
entailed by the preparation of its own case. The remuneration of 
the members of the Tribunal and of all general expenses incurred 
by the arbitration shall be borne equally by the Parties to the 
dispute. The Tribunal shall keep a record of all its expenses and 
shall furnish a final statement thereof to the Parties.


Article 8

   Any Party which has an interest of a legal nature which may be 
affected by the decision in the case may, after giving written 
notice to the Parties to the dispute which have originally 
initiated the procedure, intervene in the arbitration procedure 
with the consent of the Tribunal which should be freely given. Any 
intervenor shall participate at its own expense. Any such 
intervenor shall have the right to present evidence, briefs and 
oral arguments on the matter giving rise to its intervention, in 
accordance with procedures established pursuant to Article 9 of 
this Annex but shall have no rights with respect to the 
composition of the Tribunal.


Article 9

   A Tribunal established under the provisions of this Annex 
shall decide its own rules of procedure.


Article 10

1. Unless a Tribunal consists of a single arbitrator, decisions of 
the Tribunal as to its procedure, its place of meeting, and any 
question related to the dispute laid before it, shall be taken by 
majority vote of its members. However, the absence or abstention 
of any member of the Tribunal who was nominated by a Party to the 
dispute shall not constitute an impediment to the Tribunal 
reaching a decision. In case of equal voting, the vote of the 
Chairman shall be decisive.

2. The Parties to the dispute shall facilitate the work of the 
Tribunal and in particular shall, in accordance with their 
legislation and using all means at their disposal:

    (i) provide the Tribunal with all necessary documents and 
        information; and

   (ii) enable the Tribunal to enter their territory to hear 
        witnesses or experts, and to visit the scene of the subject
        matter of the arbitration.

3. The failure of a Party to the dispute to comply with the 
provisions of paragraph 2 or to defend its case shall not preclude 
the Tribunal from reaching a decision and rendering an award.


Article 11

   The Tribunal shall render its award within five months from 
the time it is established unless it finds it necessary to extend 
that time limit for a period not to exceed five months. The award 
of the Tribunal shall be accompanied by a statement of reasons for 
the decision. It shall be final and without appeal and shall be 
communicated to the Secretary-General of the Organisation who 
shall inform the Parties. The Parties to the dispute shall 
immediately comply with the award.
