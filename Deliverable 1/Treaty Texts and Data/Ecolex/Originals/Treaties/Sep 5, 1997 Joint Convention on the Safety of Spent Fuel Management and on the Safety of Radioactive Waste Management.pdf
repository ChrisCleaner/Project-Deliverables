JOINT CONVENTION ON THE SAFETY OF SPENT FUEL MANAGEMENT AND ON THE SAFETY OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT

PREAMBLE:

The Contracting Parties
  Recognizing that the operation of nuclear reactors generates spent fuel and 
  radioactive waste and that other applications of nuclear technologies also 
  generate radioactive waste; 

  Recognizing that the same safety objectives apply both to spent fuel and 
  radioactive waste management; 

  Reaffirming the importance to the international community of ensuring that 
  sound practices are planned and implemented for the safety of spent fuel and 
  radioactive waste management; 

  Recognizing the importance of informing the public on issues regarding the 
  safety of spent fuel and radioactive waste management; 

  Desiring to promote an effective nuclear safety culture worldwide; 

  Reaffirming that the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the safety of spent 
  fuel and radioactive waste management rests with the State; 

  Recognizing that the definition of a fuel cycle policy rests with the State, 
  some States considering spent fuel as a valuable resource that may be 
  reprocessed, others electing to dispose of it; 

  Recognizing that spent fuel and radioactive waste excluded from the present 
  Convention because they are within military or defence programmes should be 
  managed in accordance with the objectives stated in this Convention; 

  Affirming the importance of international co-operation in enhancing the safety 
  of spent fuel and radioactive waste management through bilateral and 
  multilateral mechanisms, and through this incentive Convention; 

  Mindful of the needs of developing countries, and in particular the least 
  developed countries, and of States with economies in transition and of the 
  need to facilitate existing mechanisms to assist in the fulfillment of their 
  rights and obligations set out in this incentive Convention; 

  Convinced that radioactive waste should, as far as is compatible with the 
  safety of the management of such material, be disposed of in the State in 
  which it was generated, whilst recognizing that, in certain circumstances, 
  safe and efficient management of spent fuel and radioactive waste might be 
  fostered through agreements among Contracting Parties to use facilities in one 
  of them for the benefit of the other Parties, particularly where waste 
  originates from joint projects; 

  Recognizing that any State has the right to ban import into its territory of 
  foreign spent fuel and radioactive waste; 

  Keeping in mind the Convention on Nuclear Safety (1994), the Convention on 
  Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident (1986), the Convention on Assistance 
  in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency (1986), the 
  Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (1980), the 
  Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and 
  Other Matter as amended (1994) and other relevant international instruments; 

  Keeping in mind the principles contained in the interagency "International 
  Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the 
  Safety of Radiation Sources" (1996), in the IAEA Safety Fundamentals entitled 
  "The Principles of Radioactive Waste Management" (1995), and in the existing 
  international standards relating to the safety of the transport of radioactive 
  materials; 

  Recalling Chapter 22 of Agenda 21 by the United Nations Conference on 
  Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro adopted in 1992, which reaffirms 
  the paramount importance of the safe and environmentally sound management of 
  radioactive waste; 

  Recognizing the desirability of strengthening the international control system 
  applying specifically to radioactive materials as referred to in Article 1(3) 
  of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous 
  Wastes and Their Disposal (1989); 

Have agreed as follows:

CHAPTER 1: OBJECTIVES, DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION

Article 1. 

OBJECTIVES
  The objectives of this Convention are:

  management there are effective defenses against potential hazards so that 
  individuals, society and the environment are protected from harmful effects of 
  ionizing radiation, now and in the future, in such a way that the needs and 
  aspirations of the present generation are met without compromising the ability 
  of future generations to meet their needs and aspirations; 

  to prevent accidents with radiological consequences and to mitigate their 
  consequences should they occur during any stage of spent fuel or radioactive 
  waste management.

  a condition that will be safe in the long term; 

  "decommissioning" means all steps leading to the release of a nuclear 
  facility, other than a disposal facility, from regulatory control. These steps 
  include the processes of decontamination and dismantling; 

  "discharges" means planned and controlled releases into the environment, as a

  "nuclear facility" means a civilian facility and its associated land, 
  buildings and equipment in which radioactive materials are produced, 
  processed, used, handled, stored or disposed of on such a scale that 
  consideration of safety is required; 

  "operating lifetime" means the period during which a spent fuel or a 
  radioactive waste management facility is used for its intended purpose. In the 
  case of a disposal facility, the period begins when spent fuel or radioactive 
  waste is first emplaced in the facility and ends upon closure of the facility; 

  "radioactive waste" means radioactive material in gaseous, liquid or solid 
  form for which no further use is foreseen by the Contracting Party or by a 
  natural or legal person whose decision is accepted by the Contracting Party, 
  and which is controlled as radioactive waste by a regulatory body under the 
  legislative and regulatory framework of the Contracting Party; 

  "radioactive waste management" means all activities, including decommissioning 
  activities, that relate to the handling, pretreatment, treatment, 
  conditioning, storage, or disposal of radioactive waste, excluding off-site 
  transportation. It may also involve discharges;

  primary purpose of which is spent fuel management; 

  "State of destination" means a State to which a transboundary movement is 
  planned or takes place; 

  "State of origin" means a State from which a transboundary movement is planned 
  to be initiated or is initiated; 

  "State of transit" means any State, other than a State of origin or a State of 
  destination, through whose territory a transboundary movement is planned or 
  takes place; 

  "storage" means the holding of spent fuel or of radioactive waste in a 
  facility that provides for its containment, with the intention of retrieval; 

  "transboundary movement" means any shipment of spent fuel or of radioactive 
  waste from a State of origin to a State of destination. 

Article 3. 

SCOPE OF APPLICATION
  This Convention shall apply to the safety of spent fuel management when the 
  spent fuel results from the operation of civilian nuclear reactors. Spent fuel 
  held at reprocessing facilities as part of a reprocessing activity is not 
  covered in the scope of this Convention unless the Contracting Party declares 
  reprocessing to be part of spent fuel management. 

  This Convention shall also apply to the safety of radioactive waste management 
  when the radioactive waste results from civilian applications. However, this 
  Convention shall not apply to waste that contains only naturally occurring 
  radioactive materials and that does not originate from the nuclear fuel cycle, 
  unless it constitutes a disused sealed source or it is declared as radioactive 
  waste for the purposes of this Convention by the Contracting Party. 

  This Convention shall not apply to the safety of management of spent fuel or 
  radioactive waste within military or defence programmes, unless declared as 
  spent fuel or radioactive waste for the purposes of this Convention by the 
  Contracting Party. However, this Convention shall apply to the safety of 
  management of spent fuel and radioactive waste from military or defence 
  programmes if and when such materials are transferred permanently to and 
  managed within exclusively civilian programmes. 

  This Convention shall also apply to discharges as provided for in Articles 4, 
  7, 11, 14, 24 and 26.

    the establishment of applicable national safety requirements and regulations 
    for radiation safety; 

    a system of licensing of spent fuel and radioactive waste management 
    activities; 

    a system of prohibition of the operation of a spent fuel or radioactive
