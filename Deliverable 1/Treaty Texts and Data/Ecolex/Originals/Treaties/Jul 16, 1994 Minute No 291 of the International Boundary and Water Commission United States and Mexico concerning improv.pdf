<p><b>&nbsp;IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CONVEYING CAPACITY OF THE&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY SEGMENT OF THE COLORADO RIVER&nbsp;</b></center>

<p>The Commission met at 10:00 a.m. on July 16, 1994, in the offices of
the United States Section at San Diego, California to review the conveyance
capacity of the Colorado River channel in the reach from its confluence
with the Gila River to its mouth at the Gulf of California and specifically
to consider emergency sediment removal measures in the Morelos Dam area
and establish short, medium and long term recommendations for adoption
by both countries for improvements to conveying capacity in this referenced
reach.&nbsp;
<p>The Commissioners noted the authority in Article 13 of the United States/Mexico
Treaty for "Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and
of the Rio Grande", signed February 3, 1944 for the Commission to prepare
plans for flood control in the Lower Colorado River, both in the United
States and Mexico, between Imperial Dam and the Gulf of California, and
to report to the two governments, through a Minute, regarding the works
that should be constructed, an estimate of its costs and the part of the
works corresponding to each government&nbsp;
<p>The Commissioners also observed that Article 20 of the 1944 Water Treaty
stipulates that, "... The two Governments shall, through their respective
Sections of the Commission, carry out the construction of works allotted
them. For this purpose, the respective Sections of the Commission may make
use of any competent public or private agencies in accordance with the
laws of the respective countries...." The U.S. Commissioner advised that
in the United States, the Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) of the U.S. Department
of the Interior (USDOI) is the appropriate river control agency for the
Colorado River and the Mexican Commissioner advised that in Mexico, the
National Water Commission (CNA) of the Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic
Resources (SARH) is the appropriate river control agency for the Colorado
River in Mexico.&nbsp;
<p>At the same time, the Commissioners pointed out that the two Governments
in Minute No. 217, "Clearing of the Colorado River Channel Downstream from
Morelos Dam", dated November 30, 1964, established an initial vegetation
clearing program for 40 miles (64 km) of the Colorado River downstream
of Morelos Dam to assure conveyance, between the levees, of the design
flood of 140,000 cfs (4,000 cms).&nbsp;
<p>The Commissioners referred to the records of Gila River flood of 1993
noting a mean daily high of 25,000 cfs (710 cms) was registered at the
Northerly International Boundary (NIB). They also referred to measurements
for suspended sediment at the NIB hydrographic station, or an estimated
14,624,000 cubic yards (11,179,000 cubic meters) between January and October
1993. They noted that this suggests an impediment to the passage of normal
and flood flows in the Colorado River at Morelos Dam and contributed sediment
accumulation in Mexico's intake canal.&nbsp;
<p>The Mexican Commissioner noted that under these sediment conditions
in the Colorado River in the Morelos Dam area, and its canal intake there
is a risk that Mexico may not be able to make full use of Colorado River
waters corresponding to Mexico. In view of this, both Commissioners agreed
to consider the need for emergency measures to remove an amount of sediment
that will permit Mexico to adequately divert waters corresponding to Mexico.&nbsp;
<p>The Commissioners then noted the information of the USBR and CNA, provided
to the Commission at a technical meeting held on November 15, 1993 at Morelos
Dam, that each agency has sediment removal equipment operating in nearby
waterways within its jurisdiction. In particular, CNA in view of the emergency
situation at Morelos Dam, has contracted for the removal of 1,569,448 cubic
yards (1,200,000 cubic meters) of sediment from its intake canal to accelerate
this work and conclude it in an opportune manner.&nbsp;
<p>The Commissioners then considered it necessary to also accelerate studies
in the study reach of the Colorado River from. Imperial Dam to the Gulf
of California, to define flow conveyance conditions that require correction,
especially sediment control, to present analyses of alternatives to correct
deficiencies, to recommend work and costs corresponding to each country
and recommend schedules for undertaking flood control plans contemplated
by Article 13 of the 1944 Water Treaty, including operation and maintenance
costs.&nbsp;
<p>Based on the above considerations, the Commissioners submit the following
resolutions for approval of the two Governments:&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;1. Regarding the emergency measures, the United States and Mexico
at their respective expense, in the earliest time possible, will mobilize
similar capacity equipment to carry out the work simultaneously, the sediment
removal equipment operating in nearby waterways within their respective
jurisdictions to perform sediment removal immediately upstream of the Morelos
Dam flood control gates and downstream of the dam's intake canal diversion
gates. The Government of Mexico, through the National Water Commission
(CNA), has initiated and will continue the removal of sediment downstream
of the diversion gates in the principal intake canal where the removal
of 1,569,448 cubic yards (1,200,000 cm) of sediment has already been contracted.&nbsp;
<p>2. Also, as part of the emergency work, the United States Bureau of
Reclamation (USBR), acting on behalf of the United States Government will
remove sediment in the Mexican part of the Colorado River from Morelos
Dam to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB). Because of the above,
Mexico for this time only and without setting a precedent will acquire
and prepare a disposal site along the right bank of the Colorado River,
immediately upstream of Morelos Dam with the understanding that the USBR
initially will deposit the sediment outside the Ockerson Levee, and Mexico
will prepare a site in Mexico for permanent disposal of the sediments outside
the Ockerson Levee. The operational aspects will be coordinated in the
field by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) representatives
in Yuma, Arizona and Mexicali, Baja California and the USBR and CNA.&nbsp;
<p>3. The United States Section, in the earliest time possible and no later
than 90 days from the day that this Minute enters into force, will present
to the Mexican Section the alternatives, developed by the proper authorities
in the United States to improve the conveyance capacity of the Colorado
River from the mouth of the Gila River to Morelos Dam. Such alternatives
would consider sediment removal and deposit of the material in the United
States and a goal of undertaking the proposed actions in the earliest time
possible consistent with applicable laws in the United States.&nbsp;
<p>4. The Commission, should this be necessary, will coordinate efforts
such that one agency may perform the work assigned to the other in accordance
with stipulations in this Minute<sub>, </sub>such that the country for
whom the work is performed will fully reimburse the other agency the cost
of the work undertaken by that agency. For this purpose, that agency will
in advance of the work<sub>, </sub>deposit in a bank in Yuma, Arizona or
Mexicali, Baja California, an amount equal to the estimated work or a line
of credit in favor of the IBWC from which corresponding payments would
be made through the respective Section of the Commission based on work
performed.&nbsp;
<p>5. Regarding the short, medium and long term measures, the IBWC shall
give greater priority to the studies in the reach of the Colorado River
from Imperial Dam to the Gulf of California, to define before the end of
1994, flood conveyance conditions that require correction, especially sediment
control to present analyses of alternatives to correct deficiencies, to
recommend work and costs corresponding to each country, and recommend schedules
for undertaking the flood control plan as provided in Article 13 of the
1944 Water Treaty, including its operation and maintenance costs. Any works
recommended by the Commission in such studies shall be undertaken only
upon the approval of the two Governments. Such activities would be subject
to appropriation of necessary funds to carry them out.&nbsp;
<p>6. This Minute requires the specific approval of the two Governments
and shall enter into force on the day that the two Sections notify one
another of this approval.&nbsp;</td>
