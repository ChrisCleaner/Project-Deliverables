<blockquote>2. The geographical co-ordinates referred to in this Article
are expressed in terms of the Australian Geodetic Datum 1966 (AGD 66) in
respect of point U, and in terms of the World Geodetic System 1972 (WGS
72) in respect of points V and Rl. Where for the purposes of this Agreement
it is necessary to determine the position on the surface of the Earth of
a point, line or area, that position may be determined by reference to
either AGD 66 or WGS 72. In the case of AGD 66, that reference shall be
in respect of a spheroid having its centre at the centre of the Earth,
and a major (equatorial) radius of 6,378,160 metres and a flattening of
100/29825. In the case of WGS 72, that reference shall be in respect of
a spheroid having its centre at the centre of the Earth, and a major (equatorial)
radius of 6,378,135 metres and a flattening of 100/29826.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The line described in paragraph 1 of this Article is shown
on the maps annexed to this Agreement as Annex 1 and Annex 2.</blockquote>

<blockquote ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 2</blockquote>

<blockquote>If any accumulation of liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas,
or if any other mineral deposit beneath the sea-bed, extends across the
line specified in Article 1 of this Agreement and the part of such accumulation
or deposit<b> </b>that is situated<b> </b>on one side of the line is exploitable
wholly or in part from the<b> </b>other side of the line, the two Governments
will seek to reach agreement on the manner in which the accumulation or
deposit may be most effectively exploited and on the equitable sharing
of the benefits arising from such exploitation.</blockquote>

<blockquote ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 3</blockquote>

<blockquote>Any dispute between the two Governments arising out of the
interpretation or implementation of this Agreement shall be settled peacefully
by consultation or negotiation.</blockquote>

<blockquote ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 4</blockquote>

<blockquote>Each Party shall notify the other of the completion of its
constitutional procedures necessary to bring this Agreement into force.
The Agreement shall enter into force on the day of receipt of the later
of those notifications.</blockquote>

<blockquote>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, being duly authorized
by their respective Governments, have signed this Agreement.</blockquote>

language.</blockquote>
