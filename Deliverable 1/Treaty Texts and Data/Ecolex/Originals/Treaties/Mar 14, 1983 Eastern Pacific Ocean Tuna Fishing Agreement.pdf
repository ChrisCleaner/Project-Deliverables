<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Contracting Parties to this Agreement:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Resolved to cooperate for the purpose of
ensuring the conservation and rational utilization of tuna resources in
the Eastern Pacific Ocean,</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Bearing in mind that tuna cover a broad
area which, in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, includes jurisdictional zones
of a varying nature declared by the coastal States and a considerable portion
of the seas in which coastal States do not exercise any jurisdiction,</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Recognizing that a tuna conservation regime
for the Eastern Pacific Ocean cannot be effective and equitable unless
it is comprehensive and has the participation of all States that fish tuna
in that region an a meaningful scale in relation to conservation requirements,</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Convinced that it is essential to establish,
pending conclusion of a comprehensive regional tuna conservation regime,
an interim regime, taking into account the jurisdictional zones declared
by many coastal States of the Eastern Pacific Ocean as well as the highly
migratory character of tuna,</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Have agreed as follows,</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Article I</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Contracting Parties agree to establish

in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, based on a scheme for granting licences in
the region, which guarantees rational exploitation of the resources and
equitable access to the fishing areas.</font>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">From the point on the mainland where the
parallel of 40<sup>o</sup>N latitude intersects the coast westward along
the parallel of 40<sup>o</sup>N latitude to 40<sup>o</sup>N latitude by
125<sup>o</sup>W longitude, thence southerly along the meridian of 125<sup>o</sup>W
longitude to 20<sup>o</sup>N latitude by 125<sup>o</sup>W longitude, then
easterly along the parallel of 20<sup>o</sup>N latitude to 20<sup>o</sup>N
latitude by 120<sup>o</sup>W longitude, thence southerly along the meridian
of 120<sup>o</sup>W longitude to 5<sup>o</sup>N latitude by 120<sup>o</sup>W
longitude, thence easterly along the parallel of 5<sup>o</sup>N latitude
to 5<sup>o</sup>N latitude by 110<sup>o</sup>W longitude, thence southerly
along the meridian of 110<sup>o</sup>W longitude to 10<sup>o</sup>5 latitude
by 110<sup>o</sup>W longitude, thence easterly along the parallel of 10<sup>o</sup>S
latitude to 10<sup>o</sup>S latitude by 90<sup>o</sup>W longitude, thence
southerly along the meridian of 90<sup>o</sup>W longitude to 30<sup>o</sup>S
latitude by 90<sup>o</sup>W longitude thence easterly along the parallel
of 30<sup>o</sup>S latitude to the point on the mainland where the parallel
intersects the coast, excluding the areas within 12 nautical miles of the
baseline from which the breadth of territorial sea Is measured and those
areas within 200 nautical miles of the baseline of coastal States not signatories
