AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE CREATION OF A MARINE MAMMAL SANCTUARY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN


      The Parties to the present Agreement:
     
	 Considering the threats encountered by Mediterranean marine mammals and in 
      particular to their habitats,
      
	Considering that in the Mediterranean Sea there is an area within the 
      distribution range of these animals, that is of particular importance for 
      their conservation,
      	
	Considering that according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of 
      the Sea, the area in question is in part constituted by waters with 
      respect to which each of the Contracting Parties exercises its sovereignty 
      or jurisdiction,
      
	Considering that the European Community as regards two of the State 
      parties exercises complete competence in the field of conservation and 
      management of living aquatic marine resources; that the technical 
      conservation measures for fishery resources in the Mediterranean are 
      currently established by EC Council Regulation No. 1626/94 of 27 June 1994,
      
	Recognizing that as regards two of the State parties, the provisions that 
      will be adopted in the application of the present Agreement cannot 
      prejudice the relevant Community principles and provisions, nor put in 
      question their obligations and duties as EC Member States,
      
	Keeping in mind the treaties and the other relevant international 
      instruments, namely,
      - the Conventions on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Fauna 
      and the on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Habitats,
      - the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and the 
      Agreement for the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Mediterranean and Black 
      Seas and Contiguous Atlantic Areas,
      - the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the 
      Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, and its relative Protocols,
      Wishing to take action for the conservation of Mediterranean marine 
      mammals, 
      
	have agreed as follows:
      

	Article 1 

      With respect to the present Agreement:
      a) conservation status is deemed to be "favourable" when the knowledge on 
      the populations indicate that the marine mammal species of the region are 
      maintaining themselves as a viable component of their ecosystem.
      b) the term "habitat" means any part of the range area of marine mammals, 
      temporarily or permanently occupied by them, and utilized in particular 
      for reproductive, birthing or feeding activities as well as a migration 
      route.
      c) the term "taking" means the hunting, the capturing, the killing and the 
      harassment of marine mammals including the attempt to conduct such 
      activities.
      

	Article 2 

      1. The parties establish a marine sanctuary within the area of the 
      Mediterranean Sea as defined in article 3, whose biological diversity and 
      richness represent an indispensable attribute for the protection of marine 
      mammals and their habitats.
      2. The Parties will protect all species of marine mammals within the 
      Sanctuary.
      

	Article 3 

      The sanctuary is composed of maritime areas situated within the internal 
      waters and territorial seas of the French Republic, the Italian Republic 
      and the Principality of Monaco, as well as portions of adjacent high seas. 
      The limits of the sanctuary are the following:
      - to the west, a line extending from Point Escampobariou (western point of 
      the Giens peninsula: 43º01'70'N, 06º05"90''E) to Cape Falcone, situated on 
      the western coast of the island of Sardinia (40º58'00''N, 008º12'00''E),
      - to the east, a line extending from Cape Ferro, situated on the 
      north-eastern coast of Sardinia (41º09'18''N, 009º31'18''E) to Fosso

	Article 4
 
      The Parties undertake to adopt within the sanctuary, the appropriate 
      measures mentioned in the following articles, so as to ensure the 
      favourable conservation status of marine mammals, by protecting both them

      from human activities.
 

	Article 5 

      The Parties shall cooperate with the intent of periodically assessing 
      marine mammal population status, the causes of mortality and the threats

      feeding and reproductive activities.
      

	Article 6 

      1. Taking into account their international obligations, the Parties shall 
      conduct monitoring activities within the Sanctuary and shall intensify the

      conservation status of marine mammals.
      2. The Parties will adopt national strategies aimed at phasing out the 
      release of toxic compounds within the sanctuary, giving priority to
