VIENNA CONVENTION ON CIVIL LIABILITY FOR NUCLEAR DAMAGE 

Adopted at Vienna on 21 May 1963


      The Contracting Parties,

      Having recognized the desirability of establishing some
minimum standards to provide financial protection against damage
resulting from certain peaceful uses of nuclear energy,

      Believing that a convention on civil liability for
nuclear damage would also contribute to the development of friendly
relations among nations irrespective of their differing
constitutional and social systems,

      Have decided to conclude a convention for such purposes, and
thereto have agreed as follows:


Article I 

1.    For the purpose of this Convention -

a)    "Person" means any individual, partnership, any private or
public body whether corporate or not, any international organization
enjoying legal personality under the law of the Installation State,
and any State or any of its constituent subdivisions.
 
b)    "National of a Contracting Party" includes a Contracting Party
or any of its constituent subdivisions, a partnership, or any
private or public body whether corporate or not established within
the territory of a Contracting Party.

c)    "Operator", in relation to a nuclear installation, means the
person designated or recognized by the Installation State as the
operator of that installation.

d)    "Installation State", in relation to a nuclear installation,
means the Contracting Party within whose territory that installation
is situated or, if it is not situated within the territory of any
State, the Contracting Party by which or under the authority of
which the nuclear installation is operated.

e)    "Law of the competent court" means the law of the court having
jurisdiction under this Convention, including any rules of such law
relating to conflict of laws.

f)    "Nuclear fuel" means any material which is capable of
producing energy by a self-sustaining chain process of nuclear
fission.

g)    "Radioactive products or waste" means any radioactive material
produced in, or any material made radioactive by exposure to the
radiation incidental to, the production or utilization of nuclear
fuel, but does not include radioisotopes which have reached the
final stage of fabrication so as to be usable for any scientific,
medical, agricultural, commercial or industrial purpose.

h)    "Nuclear material" means -

      (i)  nuclear fuel, other than natural uranium and depleted
           uranium, capable of producing energy by a self-sustaining
           chain process of nuclear fission outside a nuclear
           reactor, either alone or in combination with some other
           material; and 

      (ii) radioactive products or waste.

i)    "Nuclear reactor" means any structure containing nuclear fuel
in such an arrangement that a self-sustaining chain process of
nuclear fission can occur therein without an additional source of
neutrons.

j)    "Nuclear installation" means -

      (i)  any nuclear reactor other than one with which a means of
           sea or air transport is equipped for use as a source of
           power, whether for propulsion thereof or for any other
           purpose;

      (ii) any factory using nuclear fuel for the production of
           nuclear material, or any factory for the processing of
           nuclear material, including any factory for the
           re-processing of irradiated nuclear fuel, and

      (iii) any facility where nuclear material is stored other than
           storage incidental to the carriage of such material;
           provided that the Installation State may determine that
           several nuclear installations of one operator which are
           located at the same site shall be considered as a single
           nuclear installation.

k)    "Nuclear damage" means -

      (i)  loss of life, and personal injury or any loss of, or
           damage to property which arises out of or results from
           the radioactive properties or a combination of
           radioactive properties with toxic, explosive or other
           hazardous properties of nuclear fuel or radioactive
           products or waste in, or of nuclear material coming from,
           originating in, or sent to, a nuclear installation.

           ionizing radiation emitted by any other source of
           radiation inside a nuclear installation.

l)    "Nuclear incident" means any occurrence or series of
occurrences having the same origin which causes nuclear damage.

2.    An Installation State may, if the small extent of the risks
involved so warrants, exclude any small quantities of nuclear
material from the application of this Convention, provided that -

a) maximum limits for the exclusion of such quantities have been
established by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic
Energy Agency; and

b)    any exclusion by an Installation State is within such
established limits.

      The maximum limits shall be reviewed periodically by the Board
of Governors.


Article 11

1.    The operator of a nuclear installation shall be liable for
nuclear damage upon proof that such damage has been caused by a
nuclear incident -

a)    in his nuclear installation; or
b)    involving nuclear material from or originating in his nuclear
installation, and occurring -

      (i)  before liability with regard to nuclear incidents
           involving the nuclear material has been assumed, pursuant
           to the express terms of a contract in writing, by the
           operator of another nuclear installation;

      (ii) in the absence of such express terms, before the operator
           of another nuclear installation has taken charge of the
           nuclear material; or

      (iii) where the nuclear material is intended to be used in a
           nuclear reactor with which a means of transport is
           equipped for use as a source of power, whether for
           propulsion thereof or for any other purpose, before the
           person duly authorized to operate such reactor has taken
           charge of the nuclear material; but

      (iv) where the nuclear material has been sent to a person
           within the territory of a non-Contracting State, before
           it has been unloaded from the means of transport by which
           it has arrived in the territory of that non-Contracting
           State;

c)    involving nuclear materials to his nuclear installation, and
occurring -

      (i)  after liability with regard to nuclear incidents
           involving the nuclear material has been assumed by him,
           pursuant to the express terms of a contract in writing,
           from the operator of another nuclear installation;

      (ii) in the absence of such express terms, after he has taken
           charge of the nuclear material, or

      (iii) after he has taken charge of the nuclear material from a
           person operating a nuclear reactor with which a means of
           transport is equipped for use as a source of power,
           whether for propulsion thereof or for any other purpose;

           but

      (iv) where the nuclear material has, with the written consent
           of the operator, been sent from a person within the
           territory of a Contracting State, only after it has been
           loaded on the means of transport by which it is to be
           carried from the territory of that State;

provided that, if nuclear damage is caused by a nuclear incident
occurring in a nuclear installation and involving nuclear material
stored therein incidentally to the carriage of such material, the
provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph shall not apply
where another operator or person is solely liable pursuant to the
provisions of sub-paragraph (b) or (c) of this paragraph.

2.    The Installation State may provide by legislation that, in
accordance with such terms as may be specified therein, a carrier of
nuclear material or a person handling radioactive waste may, at his
request and with the consent of the operator concerned, be
designated or recognized as operator in the place of that operator
in respect of such nuclear material or radioactive waste
respectively. In this case such carrier or such person shall be
considered, for all the purposes of this Convention, as an operator
of a nuclear installation situated within the territory of that
State.

3. a)      Where nuclear damage engages the liability of more than
one operator, the operators involved shall, in so far as the damage
attributable to each operator is not reasonably separable, be
jointly and severally liable.

b)    Where a nuclear incident occurs in the course of carriage of
nuclear material, either in one and the same means of transport, or,
in the case of storage incidental to the carriage, in one and the
same nuclear installation, and causes nuclear damage which engages
the liability of more than one operator, the total liability shall
not exceed the highest amount applicable with, respect to any one of
them pursuant to Article V.

c)    In neither of the cases referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this paragraph shall the liability of any one operator exceed
the amount applicable with respect to him pursuant to Article V.

4.    Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article,
where several nuclear installations of one and the same operator are
involved in one nuclear incident, such Operator shall be liable in
respect of each nuclear installation involved up to the amount
applicable with respect to him pursuant to Article V.

5.    Except as otherwise provided in this Convention, no person
other than the operator shall be liable for nuclear damage. This,
however, shall not affect the application of any international
convention in the field of transport in force or open for signature,
ratification or accession at the date on which this Convention is
opened for signature.

6.    No person shall be liable for any loss or damage which is not
nuclear damage pursuant to sub-paragraph (k) of paragraph 1 of
Article I but which could have been included as such pursuant to
sub-paragraph (k) (ii) of that paragraph.

7.    Direct action shall lie against the person furnishing
financial security pursuant to Article VII, if the law of the
competent court so provides.


Article III

      The operator liable in accordance with this Convention shall
provide the carrier with a certificate issued by or on behalf of the
insurer or other financial guarantor furnishing the financial
security required pursuant to Article VII. The certificate shall
state the name and address of that operator, and the amount, type
and duration of the security, and these statements may not be
disputed by the person by whom or on whose behalf the certificate
was issued. The certificate shall also indicate the nuclear material
in respect of which the security applies and shall include a
statement by the competent public authority of the Installation
State that the person named is an operator within the meaning of
this Convention.


Article IV

1.    The liability of the operator for nuclear damage under this
Convention shall be absolute. 

2.    If the operator proves that the nuclear damage resulted wholly
or partly either from the gross negligence of the person suffering
the damage or from an act or omission of such person done with
intent to cause damage, the competent court may, if its law so
provides, relieve the operator wholly or partly from his obligation
to pay compensation in respect of the damage suffered by such
person.

3. a)      No liability under this convention shall attach to an
operator for nuclear damage caused by a nuclear incident directly
due to an act of armed conflict, hostilities, civil war or
insurrection.

b)    Except in so far as the law of the Installation State may
provide to the contrary, the operator shall not be liable for
nuclear damage caused by a nuclear incident directly due to a grave
natural disaster of an exceptional character.

4.    Whenever both nuclear damage and damage other than nuclear
damage have been caused by a nuclear incident or jointly by a
nuclear incident and one or more other occurrences, such other
damage shall, to the extent that it is not reasonably separable from
the nuclear damage, be deemed, for the purposes of this Convention,
to be nuclear damage caused by that nuclear incident. Where,
however, damage is caused jointly by a nuclear incident covered by
this Convention and by an emission of ionizing radiation not covered
by it nothing in this Convention shall limit or otherwise affect the
liability, either as regards any person suffering nuclear damage or
by way of recourse or contribution, of any person who may be held
liable in connection with that emission of ionizing radiation.

5.    The operator shall not be liable under this Convention for
nuclear damage -

a)    to the nuclear installation itself or to any property on the
site of that installation which is used or to be used in connection
with that installation; or

b)    to the means of transport upon which the nuclear material
involved was at the time of the nuclear incident.

6.    Any Installation State may provide by legislation that
sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 5 of this Article shall not apply,
provided that in no case shall the liability of the operator in
respect of nuclear damage, other than nuclear damage to the means of
transport, be reduced to less than US$5 million for any one nuclear
incident.

7.    Nothing in this Convention shall affect - 

a)    the liability of any individual for nuclear damage for which
the operator, by virtue of paragraph 3 or 5 of this Article, is not
liable under this Convention and which that individual caused by an
act or omission done with intent to cause damage; or

b)    the liability outside this Convention of the operator for
nuclear damage for which, by virtue of sub-paragraph (b) of
paragraph 5 of this Article, he is not liable under this Convention.


Article V

1.    The liability of the operator may be limited by the
Installation State to not less than US$5 million for any one nuclear
incident.

2.    Any limits of liability which may be established pursuant to
this Article shall not include any interest or costs awarded by a
court in actions for compensation of nuclear damage.

3.    The United States dollar referred to in this Convention is a
unit of account equivalent to the value of the United States dollar
in terms of gold on 29 April 1963, that is to say US$35 per one troy
ounce of fine gold.

4.    The sum mentioned in paragraph 6 of Article IV and in
paragraph 1 of this Article may be converted into national currency
in round figures.


Article VI

1.    Rights of compensation under this Convention shall be
extinguished if an action is not brought within ten years from the
date of the nuclear incident. If, however, under the law of the
Installation State the liability of the operator is covered by
insurance or other financial security or by State funds for a period
longer than ten years, the law of the competent court may provide
that rights of compensation against the operator shall only be
extinguished after a period which may be longer than ten years, but
shall not be longer than the period for which his liability is so
covered under the law of the Installation State. Such extension of
the extinction period shall in no case affect rights of compensation
under this Convention of any person who has brought an action for
loss of life or personal injury against the operator before the
expiry of the aforesaid period of ten years.

2.    Where nuclear damage is caused by a nuclear incident involving
nuclear material which at the time of the nuclear incident was
stolen, lost, jettisoned or abandoned, the period established
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article shall be computed from the
date of that nuclear incident, but the period shall in no case
exceed a period of twenty years from the date of the theft, loss,
jettison or abandonment.

3.    The law of the competent court may establish a period of
extinction or prescription of not less than three years from the
date on which the person suffering nuclear damage had knowledge or
should have had knowledge of the damage and of the operator liable
for the damage, provided that the period established pursuant to
paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not be exceeded.

4.    Unless the law of the competent court otherwise provides, any
person who claims to have suffered nuclear damage and who has
brought an action for compensation within the period applicable
pursuant to this Article may amend his claim to take into account
any aggravation of the damage, even after the expiry of that period,
provided that final judgment has not been entered. 

5.    Where jurisdiction is to be determined pursuant to
sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 3 of Article XI and a request has
been made within the period applicable pursuant to this Article to
any one of the Contracting Parties empowered so to determine but the
time remaining after such determination is less than six months, the
period within which an action may be brought shall be six months,
reckoned from the date of such determination.


Article VII

1.    The operator shall be required to maintain insurance or other
financial security covering his liability for nuclear damage in such
amount, of such type and in such terms as the Installation State
shall specify. The Installation State shall ensure the payment of
claims for compensation for nuclear damage which have been
established against the operator by providing the necessary funds to
the extent that the yield of insurance or other financial security
is inadequate to satisfy such claims, but not in excess of the
limit, if any, established pursuant to Article V.

2.    Nothing in paragraph 1 of this Article shall require a
Contracting Party or any of its constituent sub-divisions, such as
States or Republics, to maintain insurance or other financial
security to cover their liability as operators.

3.    The funds provided by insurance by other financial security or
by the Installation State pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article
shall be exclusively available for compensation due under this
Convention.

4.    No insurer or other financial guarantor shall suspend or
cancel the insurance or other financial security provided pursuant
to paragraph 1 of this Article without giving notice in writing of
at least two months to the competent public authority or, in so far
as such insurance or other financial security relates to the
carriage of nuclear material during the period of the carriage in
question.


Article VIII

      Subject to the provisions of this Convention, the nature, form
and extent of the compensation, as well as the equitable
distribution thereof, shall be governed by the law of the competent
court.


Article IX

1.    Where provisions of national or public health, insurance,
social insurance, social security, workmen's compensation or
occupational disease compensation systems include compensation for
nuclear damage, rights of beneficiaries of such systems to obtain
compensation under this Convention and rights of recourse by virtue
of such systems against the operator liable shall be determined,
subject to the provisions of this Convention, by the law of the
Contracting Party in which such systems have been established, or by
the regulations of the intergovernmental organization which
established such systems.

2. a)      If a person who is a national of a Contracting Party,
other than the operator, has paid compensation for nuclear damage
under an international convention or under the law of a non-
Contracting State, such person shall, up to the amount which he has
paid, acquire by subrogation the rights under this Convention of the
person so compensated. No rights shall be so acquired by any person
to the extent that the operator has a right of recourse against such
person under this Convention.

b)    Nothing in this Convention shall preclude an operator who has
paid compensation for nuclear damage out of funds other than those
provided pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article VII from recovering from
the person providing financial security pursuant to that paragraph
or from the Installation State, up to the amount he has paid, the
sum which the person so compensated would have obtained under this
Convention.


Article X

      The operator shall have a right of recourse only -

a)    if this is expressly provided for by a contract in writing: or

b)    if the nuclear incident results from an act or omission done
with intent to cause damage, against the individual who has acted or
omitted to act with such intent.


Article XI 

1.    Except as otherwise provided in this Article jurisdiction over
actions under Article II shall lie only with the courts of the
Contracting Party within whose territory the nuclear incident
occurred.

2.    Where the nuclear incident occurred outside the territory of
any Contracting Party, or where the place of the nuclear incident
cannot be determined with certainty, jurisdiction over such actions
shall lie with the courts of the Installation State of the operator
liable.

3.    Where under paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article, jurisdiction
would he with the courts of more than one Contracting Party,
jurisdiction shall lie -

a)    if the nuclear incident occurred partly outside the territory
of any Contracting Party, and partly within the territory of a
single Contracting Party, with the courts of the latter; and

b)    in any other case, with the courts of that Contracting Party
which is determined by agreement between the Contracting Parties
whose courts would be competent under paragraph 1 or 2 of this
Article.


Article XII

1.    A final judgment entered by a court having jurisdiction under
Article XI shall be recognized within the territory of any other
Contracting Party, except -

a)    where the judgment was obtained by fraud;

b)    where the party against whom the judgment was pronounced was
not given a fair opportunity to present his case; or

c)    where the judgment is contrary to the public policy of the
Contracting Party within the territory of which recognition is
sought, or is not in accord with fundamental standards of justice.

2.    A final judgement which is recognized shall, upon being
presented for enforcement in accordance with the formalities
required by the law of the Contracting Party where enforcement is
sought, be enforceable as if it were a judgment of a court of that
Contracting Party.

3.    The merits of a claim on which the judgment has been given
shall not be subject to further proceedings.


Article XIII

      This Convention and the national law applicable thereunder
shall be applied without any discrimination based upon nationality,
domicile or residence.


Article XIV

      Except in respect of measures of execution, jurisdictional
immunities under rules of national or international law shall not be
invoked in actions under this Convention before the courts competent
pursuant to Article XI.


Article XV

      The Contracting Parties shall take appropriate measures to
ensure that compensation for nuclear damage, interest and costs
awarded by a court in connection therewith, insurance and
reinsurance premiums and funds provided by insurance, reinsurance or
other financial security, or funds provided by the Installation
State, pursuant to this Convention, shall be freely transferable
into the currency of the Contracting Party within whose territory
the damage is suffered, and of the Contracting Party within whose
territory the claimant is habitually resident, and, as regards
insurance or reinsurance premiums and payments, into the currencies
specified in the insurance or reinsurance contract.


Article XVI

      No person shall be entitled to recover compensation under this
Convention to the extent that he has recovered compensation in
respect of the same nuclear damage under another international
convention on civil liability in the field of nuclear energy.


Article XVII

      This Convention shall not, as between the parties to them,
affect the application of any international agreements or
international conventions on civil liability in the field of nuclear
energy in force, or open for signature, ratification or accession at
the date on which this Convention is opened for signature.


Article XVIII

      This Convention shall not be construed as affecting the
rights, if any, of a Contracting Party under the general rules of
public international law in respect of nuclear damage.


Article XIX

1.    Any Contracting Party entering into an agreement pursuant to
sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 3 of Article XI shall furnish without
