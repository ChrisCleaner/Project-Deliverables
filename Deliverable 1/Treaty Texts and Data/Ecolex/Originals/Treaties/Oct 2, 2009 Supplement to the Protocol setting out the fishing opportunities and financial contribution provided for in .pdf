Each vessel may be replaced by another of equal or smaller gross registered tonnage subject to the following conditions:

(a) at least three months after the licence was issued;

(b) during a given period of three months by reason of force majeure.

In respect of the 10 % who may not be on board, the shipowner shall pay compensation of ECU 200/month per seaman to the Mauritanian authorities at the same time as the licence fee. Such compensation shall be used for the training of Mauritanian fishermen.

8. Special provisions

(a) Community shipowners shall own the catches in their entirety and be free to decide upon their sale and unloading in the port of their choice.

(b) Community vessels are required to abide by Mauritanian regulations in force for the protection of juveniles.

the Mauritanian authorities to be informed in real time of landings
performed by vessels operating in Mauritanian waters.

(d) Community shipowners shall be free to choose the local agents for their vessels although they must be of Mauritanian nationality.

(e) The European Union and Mauritania, in their concern for the conservation of resources, shall endeavour to cooperate to strengthen the system for the surveillance of the Mauritanian EEZ.
