ecosystems, and the safeguarding of the heritage of wildlife and 
its habitat;

indigenous customs and traditional cultural practices and the need 
to give due consideration to such matters;

and development of these resources through careful planning and 
management for the benefit of present and future generations;

involved, encourage the creation of protected areas which together 
with existing protected areas will safeguard representative

attention being given to endangered species), as well as 
superlative scenery, striking geological formations, and regions 
and objects of aesthetic interest or historic, cultural or 
scientific value.

1. The Contracting Parties shall, in addition to the protection

species shall be allowed only with the permission of the
