Protocol on Protection of the Black Sea Marine Environment Against Pollution
from Land Based Sources 


Article 1 

In accordance with Article VII of the Convention, the 
Contracting Parties shall take all necessary measures to 
prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment 
of the Black Sea caused by discharges from land-based sources on 
their territories such as rivers, canals, coastal 
establishments, other artificial structures, out falls or 
run-off, or emanating from any other land-based source, 
including through the atmosphere. 


Article 2 

For the purposes of this Protocol, the fresh water limit means 
the landward part of the line drawn between the endpoints on the 
right and the left banks of a water course where it reaches the 
Black Sea. 


Article 3 

This protocol shall apply to the Black Sea as defined in Article 
I of the Convention and to the waters landward of the baselines 
from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured and in 
the case of fresh-watercourses, up to the fresh-water limit. 


Article 4 

The Contracting Parties undertake to prevent and eliminate 
pollution of the marine environment of the Black Sea from 
land-based sources by substances and matter listed in Annex I to 
this Protocol. The Contracting Parties undertake to reduce and, 
whenever possible, to eliminate pollution of the marine 
environment of the Black Sea from land-based sources by 
substances and matter listed in Annex II to this Protocol. As to 
water courses that are tributaries to the Black Sea, the 
Contracting Parties will endeavour to cooperate, as appropriate, 
with other States in order to achieve the purposes set forth in 
this Article. 


Article 5 

Pursuant to the provisions of Article XV of the Convention, each 
Contracting Party shall carry out, at the earliest possible 
date, monitoring activities in order to assess the levels of 
pollution, its sources and ecological effects along its coast, 
in particular with regard to the substances and matter listed in 
Annexes I and II to this Protocol. Additional research will be 
conducted upstream of river sections in order to investigate 
fresh/salt water interactions. 


Article 6 

In conformity with Article XV of the Convention, the Contracting 
Parties shall cooperate in elaborating common guidelines, 
standards or criteria dealing with special characteristics of 
marine out falls and in undertaking research on specific 
requirements for effluents necessitating separate treatment and 
concerning the quantities of discharged substances and matter 
listed in Annexes I and II, their concentration in effluents, 
and methods of discharging them. The common emission standards 
and timetable for the implementation of the programme and 
measures aimed at preventing, reducing or eliminating, as 
appropriate, pollution from land-based sources shall be fixed by 
the Contracting Parties and periodically reviewed for substances 
and matter listed in Annexes I and II to this Protocol. The 
Commission shall define pollution prevention criteria as well as 
recommend appropriate measures to reduce, control and eliminate 
pollution of the marine environment of the Black Sea from 
land-based sources. The Contracting Parties shall take into 
consideration the following: 

a) The discharge of water from municipal sewage systems should 
be made in such a way as to reduce the pollution of the marine 
environment of the Black Sea. 

b) The pollution load of industrial wastes should be reduced in 
order to comply with the accepted concentrations of substances 
and matter listed in Annexes I and II to this Protocol. 

c) The discharge of cooling water from nuclear power plants or 
other industrial enterprises using large amounts of water should 
be made in such a way as to prevent pollution of the marine 
environment of the Black Sea. 

d) The pollution load from agricultural and forest areas 
affecting the water quality of the marine environment of the 
Black Sea should be reduced in order to comply with the accepted 
concentrations of substances and matter listed in Annexes I and 
II to this Protocol. 


Article 7 

The Contracting Parties shall inform one another through the 
Commission of measures taken, results achieved or difficulties 
encountered in the application of this Protocol. Procedures for 
the collection and transmission of such information shall be 
determined by the Commission. 


Annex I 

Hazardous Substances and Matter 

The following substances or groups of substances or matter are 
not listed in order of priority. They have been selected mainly 
on the basis of their toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation 
characteristics. This Annex does not apply to discharges which 
contain substances and matter listed below that are below the 
concentration limits defined jointly by the Contracting Parties, 
not exceeding environmental background concentrations. 

1. Organotin compounds. 

2. Organohalogen compounds e.g. DDT, DDE, DDD, PCB's. 

3. Persistent organophosphorus compounds. 

4. Mercury and mercury compounds.

teratogenic or mutagenic properties. 

7. Used lubricating oils. 

8. Persistent synthetic materials which may float, sink or 
remain in suspension. 

9. Radioactive substances and wastes, including used radioactive 
fuel. 

10. Lead and lead compounds. 


Annex II 

Noxious Substances and Matter 

The following substances and matter have been selected mainly on 
the basis of criteria used in Annex I, while taking into account 
the fact that they are less harmful or more readily rendered 
harmless by natural processes. The control and strict limitation 
of the discharges of substances and matter referred to in this 
Annex shall be implemented in accordance with Annex III to this 
Protocol. 

1. Biocides and their derivatives not covered in Annex I.
