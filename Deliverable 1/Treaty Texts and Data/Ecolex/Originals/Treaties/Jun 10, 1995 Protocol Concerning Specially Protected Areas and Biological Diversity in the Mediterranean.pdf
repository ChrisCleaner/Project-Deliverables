Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and aBiological Diversity in the Mediterranean 

The Contracting Parties to the present Protocol,

Being Parties to the Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against
Pollution, adopted at Barcelona on 16 February 1976,

Conscious of the profound impact of human activities on the state of the marine
environment and the littoral and more generally on the ecosystems of areas having prevailing
Mediterranean features,

Stressing the importance of protecting and, as appropriate, improving the state of the
Mediterranean natural and cultural heritage, in particular through the establishment of specially protected areas and also by the protection and conservation of threatened species,

Considering the instruments adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development and particularly the Convention on Biological Diversity (Rio de Janeiro, 1992),

Conscious that when there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be invoked as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat,

Considering that all the Contracting Parties should cooperate to conserve, protect and
restore the health and integrity of ecosystems and that they have, in this respect, common but differentiated responsibilities,

Have agreed as follows:

1 The Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the
Mediterranean was adopted on 10 June 1995 by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries for the
Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution and its Protocols, held in Barcelona.
The Protocol, which will replace the Protocol concerning Mediterranean Specially
Protected Areas of 1982 in accordance with its Article 32, has not yet entered into force.
The Annexes to the Protocol were adopted on 24 November 1996 by the Meeting of
Plenipotentiaries on the Annexes to the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas
and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean, held in Monaco..MAP Phase II and the Barcelona Convention and its Protocols

ANNEX I
COMMON CRITERIA FOR THE CHOICE OF PROTECTED MARINE
AND COASTAL AREAS THAT COULD BE INCLUDED
IN THE SPAMI LIST
A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The Contracting Parties agree that the following general principles will guide their work in
establishing the SPAMI List:
a) The conservation of the natural heritage is the basic aim that must characterize a
SPAMI. The pursuit of other aims such as the conservation of the cultural heritage, and the
promotion of scientific research, education, participation, collaboration, is highly desirable in SPAMIs and constitutes a factor in favour of a site being included on the List, to the extent in which it remains compatible with the aims of conservation.
b) No limit is imposed on the total number of areas included in the List or on the
number of areas any individual Party can propose for inscription. Nevertheless, the Parties agree that sites will be selected on a scientific basis and included in the List according to their qualities; they will have therefore to fulfil the requirements set out by the Protocol and the present criteria.
c) The listed SPAMI and their geographical distribution will have to be representative
of the Mediterranean region and its biodiversity. To this end the List will have to represent the highest number possible of types of habitats and ecosystems.
d) The SPAMIs will have to constitute the core of a network aiming at the effective
conservation of the Mediterranean heritage. To attain this objective, the Parties will develop their cooperation on bilateral and multilateral bases in the field of conservation and management of natural sites and notably through the establishment of transboundary SPAMIs.
e) The sites included in the SPAMI List are intended to have a value of example and
model for the protection of the natural heritage of the region. To this end, the Parties ensure that sites included in the List are provided with adequate legal status, protection measures and management methods and means.
B. GENERAL FEATURES OF THE AREAS THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN THE
SPAMI LIST
1. To be eligible for inclusion in the SPAMI List, an area must fulfil at least one of the
general criteria set in Article 8 paragraph 2 of the Protocol. Several of these general criteria can in certain cases be fulfilled by the same area, and such a circumstance cannot but strengthen the case for the inclusion of the area in the List.
2. The regional value is a basic requirement of an area for being included in the
SPAMI List. The following criteria should be used in evaluating the Mediterranean interest of an area:.Specially Protected Areas Protocol
a) Uniqueness
The area contains unique or rare ecosystems, or rare or endemic species.
b) Natural representativeness
The area has highly representative ecological processes, or community or habitat
types or other natural characteristics. Representativeness is the degree to which an area represents a habitat type, ecological process, biological community, physiographic feature or other natural characteristic.
c) Diversity
The area has a high diversity of species, communities, habitats or ecosystems.
d) Naturalness
The area has a high degree of naturalness as a result of the lack or low level of
human-induced disturbance and degradation.
e) Presence of habitats that are critical to endangered, threatened or endemic species.
f) Cultural representativeness
The area has a high representative value with respect to the cultural heritage, due to
the existence of environmentally sound traditional activities integrated with nature which support the well-being of local populations.
3. To be included in the SPAMI List, an area having scientific, educational or
aesthetic interest must, respectively, present a particular value for research in the field of natural sciences or for activities of environmental education or awareness or contain outstanding natural features, landscapes or seascapes.
4. Besides the fundamental criteria specified in article 8, paragraph 2, of the Protocol, a
certain number of other characteristics and factors should be considered as favourable for the inclusion of the site in the List. These include:
a) the existence of threats likely to impair the ecological, biological, aesthetic or
cultural value of the area;
b) the involvement and active participation of the public in general, and particularly of
local communities, in the process of planning and management of the area;
c) the existence of a body representing the public, professional, non-governmental
sectors and the scientific community involved in the area;
d) the existence in the area of opportunities for sustainable development;
e) the existence of an integrated coastal management plan within the meaning of
Article 4 paragraph 3 (e) of the Convention..MAP Phase II and the Barcelona Convention and its Protocols
C. LEGAL STATUS
1. All areas eligible for inclusion in the SPAMI List must be awarded a legal status
guaranteeing their effective long-term protection.
2. To be included in the SPAMI List, an area situated in a zone already delimited over
which a Party exercises sovereignty or jurisdiction must have a protected status recognized by the Party concerned.
3. In the case of areas situated, partly or wholly, on the high sea or in a zone where the
limits of national sovereignty or jurisdiction have not yet been defined, the legal status, the management plan, the applicable measures and the other elements provided for in Article 9, paragraph 3, of the Protocol will be provided by the neighbouring Parties concerned in the proposal for inclusion in the SPAMI List.
D. PROTECTION, PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES
1. Conservation and management objectives must be clearly defined in the texts
relating to each site, and will constitute the basis for assessment of the adequacy of the adopted measures and the effectiveness of their implementation at the revisions of the SPAMI List.
2. Protection, planning and management measures applicable to each area must be
adequate for the achievement of the conservation and management objectives set for the site in the short and long term, and take in particular into account the threats upon it.
3. Protection, planning and management measures must be based on an adequate
knowledge of the elements of the natural environment and of socio-economic and cultural factors that characterize each area. In case of shortcomings in basic knowledge, an area proposed for inclusion in the SPAMI List must have a programme for the collection of the unavailable data and information.
4. The competence and responsibility with regard to administration and
implementation of conservation measures for areas proposed for inclusion in the SPAMI List must be clearly defined in the texts governing each area.
5. In the respect of the specificity characterizing each protected site, the protection
measures for a SPAMI must take account of the following basic aspects:
a) the strengthening of the regulation of the release or dumping of wastes and other
substances likely directly or indirectly to impair the integrity of the area;
b) the strengthening of the regulation of the introduction or reintroduction of any
species into the area;
c) the regulation of any activity or act likely to harm or disturb the species, or that
might endanger the conservation status of the ecosystems or species or might impair the natural, cultural or aesthetic characteristics of the area.
d) the regulation applicable to the zones surrounding the area in question..Specially Protected Areas Protocol
6. To be included in the SPAMI List, a protected area must have a management body,
endowed with sufficient powers as well as means and human resources to prevent and/or control activities likely to be contrary to the aims of the protected area.
7. To be included in the SPAMI List an area will have to be endowed with a
management plan. The main rules of this management plan are to be laid down as from the time of inclusion and implemented immediately. A detailed management plan must be presented within three years of the time of inclusion. Failure to respect this obligation entails the removal of the site from the List.
8. To be included in the SPAMI List, an area will have to be endowed with a
monitoring programme. This programme should include the identification and monitoring of a
certain number of significant parameters for the area in question, in order to allow the assessment of the state and evolution of the area, as well as the effectiveness of protection and management measures implemented, so that they may be adapted if need be. To this end further necessary studies are to be commissioned..MAP Phase II and the Barcelona Convention and its Protocols
