   Realizing that pollution of the marine environment in the 
Region shared by Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi 
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, by oil and other harmful or 
noxious materials arising from human activities on land or at sea, 
especially through indiscriminate and uncontrolled discharge of 
these substances, presents a growing threat to marine life, 
fisheries, human health, recreational uses of beaches and other 
amenities.

   Mindful of the special hydrographic and ecological 
characteristics of the marine environment of the Region and its 
particular vulnerability to pollution.

   Conscious of the need to ensure that the processes of urban 
and rural development and resultant land use should be carried out 
in such a manner as to preserve, as far as possible, marine 
resources and coastal amenities, and that such development should 
not lead to deterioration of the marine environment,

   Convinced of the need to ensure that the processes of 
industrial development should not, in any way, cause damage to the 
marine environment of the Region, jeopardize its living resources 
or create hazards to human health,

   Recognizing the need to develop an integrated management 
approach to the use of the marine environment and the coastal 
areas which will allow the achievement of environmental and 
development goals in a harmonious manner,

   Recognizing also the need for a carefully planned research, 
monitoring and assessment programme in view of the scarcity of 
scientific information on marine pollution in the Region,

   Considering that the States sharing the Region have a special 
responsibility to protect its marine environment,

   Aware of the importance of co-operation and co-ordination of 
action on a regional basis with the aim of protecting the marine 
environment of the Region for the benefit of all concerned,
