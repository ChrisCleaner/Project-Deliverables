AFRICAN CONVENTION ON THE CONSERVATION OF NATURE AND 
NATURAL RESOURCES 

Adopted at Algiers on 15 September 1968

Preamble:

      We the Heads of State and Government of Independent African
States,

      Fully conscious that soil, water, flora and faunal
resources constitute a capital of vital importance to mankind;

      Confirming, as we accepted upon declaring our adherence to the
Charter of the Organization of African Unity, that we know that it
is our duty "to harness the natural and human resources of our
continent for the total advancement of our peoples in spheres of
human endeavour";

resources from an economic, nutritional, scientific, educational,
cultural and aesthetic point of view;

irreplaceable assets;

      Accepting that the utilization of the natural resources must
aim at satisfying the needs of man according to the carrying
capacity of the environment;

      Desirous of undertaking individual and joint action for the
conservation, utilization and development of these assets by
establishing and maintaining their rational utilization for the
present and future welfare of mankind;

           be altered nor any portion alienated except by the
           competent legislative authority,

           the abandonment by hunters of carcasses of animals, which
           represent a food resource, is prohibited.

      Capture of animals with the aid of drugs or mechanically
propelled vehicles, or hunting or capture by night if carried out
by, or under the control of, the competent authority shall
nevertheless be exempted from the prohibitions under (c) above.


Article VIII

Protected species

1.    The Contracting States recognize that it is important and
urgent to accord a special protection to those animal and plant
species that are threatened with extinction, or which may become so,
and to the habitat necessary to their survival. Where such a species
is represented only in the territory of one Contracting State, that
State has a particular responsibility for its protection. These
species which are, or may be listed, according to the degree of
protection that shall be given to them are placed in Class A or B of

           hunting, killing, capture or collection of specimens
           shall be permitted only on the authorization in each case
           of the highest competent authority and only if required
           in the national interest or for scientific purposes; and

      (ii) species in Class B shall be totally protected, but may be
           hunted, killed, captured or collected under special
           authorization granted by the competent authority.

2.    The competent authority of each Contracting State shall
examine the necessity of applying the provisions of this article to
species not listed in the annex, in order to conserve the indigenous
flora and fauna of their respective countries. Such additional
species shall be placed in Class A or B by the state concerned,
according to its specific requirements.


Article IX

paragraph (1) applies, the Contracting States shall:

a)    take all measures similar to those in paragraph (1);

b)    make the export of such specimens and trophies subject to an
authorization:

      (i)  additional to that required for their capture, killing or
           collection by Article VIII,

      (ii) which indicates their destination,

      (iii) which shall not be given unless the specimens or
           trophies have been obtained legally,

           of those listed or which may be listed in the annex to
