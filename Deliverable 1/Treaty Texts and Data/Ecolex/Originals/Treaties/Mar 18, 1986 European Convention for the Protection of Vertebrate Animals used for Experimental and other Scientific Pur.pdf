EUROPEAN CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF VERTEBRATE ANIMALS USED
FOR EXPERIMENTAL AND OTHER SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES

Adopted in Strasbourg on 18 March, 1986. 

PREAMBLE

      The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto,

      Recalling that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve
a greater unity between its members and that it wishes to co-operate
with other States in the protection of live animals used for
experimental and other scientific purposes;

      Recognising that man has a moral obligation to respect all
animals and to have due consideration for their capacity for
suffering and memory;

      Accepting nevertheless that man in his quest for knowledge,
health and safety has a need to use animals where there is a
reasonable expectation that the result will be to extend knowledge
or be to the overall benefit of man or animal, just as he uses them
for food, clothing and as beasts of burden;

      Resolved to limit the use of animals for experimental and
other scientific purposes, with the aim of replacing such use
wherever practical, in particular by seeking alternative measures
and encouraging the use of these alternative measures;

      Desirous to adopt common provisions in order to protect
animals used in those procedures which may possibly cause pain,
suffering, distress or lasting harm and to ensure that where
unavoidable they shall be kept to a minimum,  

      Have agreed as follows:

Part I
General Principles


Article 1

1.    This Convention applies to any animal used or intended for use
in any experimental or other scientific procedure where that
procedure may cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. It
does not apply to any non-experimental agricultural or clinical
veterinary practice.

2.    In this Convention:

(a)   "animal", unless otherwise qualified, means any live non-human
vertebrate, including free-living and/or reproducing larval forms,
but excluding other foetal or embryonic forms;

(b)   "intended for use" means bred or kept for the purpose of sale,
disposal or use in any experimental or other scientific procedure;

(c)   "procedure" means any experimental or other scientific  use of
an animal which may cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm,
including any course of action intended to, or liable to, result in
the birth of an animal in any such conditions, but excluding the
least painful methods accepted in modern practice (that is, "humane"
methods) of killing or marking an animal. A procedure starts when an
animal is first prepared for use and ends when no further
observations are to be made for that procedure; the elimination of
pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm by the successful use of
anaesthesia or analgesia or other methods does not place the use of
an animal outside the scope of this definition;

(d)   "competent person" means any person who is considered by a
Party to be competent in its territory to perform the relevant
function described in this Convention;

(e)   "responsible authority" means in the territory of a given
Party, any authority, body or person designated for the relevant
purpose;

(f)   "establishment" means any stable or mobile facility, any
building, group of buildings or other premises, including a place
which is not wholly enclosed or covered;

(g)   "breeding establishment" means any establishment where animals
are bred with a view to their use in procedures;

(h)   "supplying establishment" means any establishment, other than
a breeding establishment, from which animals are supplied with a
view to their use in procedures;

(i)   "user establishment" means any establishment where animals are
used in procedures;

(j)   "humane method of killing" means the killing of an animal with
a minimum of physical and mental suffering appropriate to the
species.


Article 2

      A procedure may be performed for one or more of the following
purposes only and subject to the restrictions laid down in this
Convention:

(a)   (i)  avoidance or prevention of disease, ill-health or other
           abnormality, of their effects, in man, vertebrate or
           invertebrate animals or plants, including the production
           and the quality, efficacy and safety testing of drugs,
           substances or products;

      (ii) diagnosis or treatment of disease, ill-health or other
           abnormality, or their effects, in man, vertebrate or
           invertebrate animals or plants;

(b)   detection, assessment, regulation or modification of
physiological conditions in man, vertebrate and invertebrate 
animals or plants;

(c)   protection of the environment;

(d)   scientific research;

(e)   education and training;

(f)   forensic inquiries.

Article 3

      Each Party undertakes to take all the necessary steps to give
effect to the provisions of this Convention and to ensure an
effective system of control and supervision as soon as possible and
in any case within a period of five years from the date of entry
into force of the present Convention in respect of that Party.


Article 4

      No provision in this Convention shall affect the liberty of
the Parties to adopt stricter measures for the protection of animals
used in procedures or for the control and restriction of the use of
animals in procedures.

2.    Each Party undertakes to extend the provisions of paragraph 1
of this article to other species, in particular of the order of
primates, as soon as there is a reasonable prospect of a sufficient
supply of purpose-bred animals of the species concerned.

3.    Straying animals of a domesticated species shall not be used
in procedures. A general exemption made under the conditions of
paragraph 1 of this article may not extend to stray dogs and cats.


Article 22

      In user establishments, only animals supplied from registered
breeding or supplying establishments shall be used, unless a general
or special exemption has been obtained under arrangements to be
determined by the Party.
