Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Paris Convention on Third Party 
Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy as well as in national legislation on 
compensation for nuclear damage consistent with the principles of these 
Conventions;

DESIROUS of establishing a worldwide liability regime to supplement and enhance 
these measures with a view to increasing the amount of compensation for nuclear 
damage; 

RECOGNIZING further that such a worldwide liability regime would encourage 
regional and global co-operation to promote a higher level of nuclear safety in 
accordance with the principles of international partnership and solidarity;

HAVE AGREED as follows:

Purpose and Application
  The purpose of this Convention is to supplement the system of compensation 
  provided pursuant to national law which: 

    implements one of the instruments referred to in Article I (a) and (b); or 

    complies with the provisions of the Annex to this Convention. 

  The system of this Convention shall apply to nuclear damage for which an 
  operator of a nuclear installation used for peaceful purposes situated in the 
  territory of a Contracting Party is liable under either one of the Conventions 
  referred to in Article I or national law mentioned in paragraph 1(b) of this 
  Article. 

  The Annex referred to in paragraph 1(b) shall constitute an integral part of 
  this Convention. 

CHAPTER II
COMPENSATION

Article III 

Undertaking
  Compensation in respect of nuclear damage per nuclear incident shall be 
  ensured by the following means: 

      the Installation State shall ensure the availability of 300 million SDRs 
      or a greater amount that it may have specified to the Depositary at any 
      time prior to the nuclear incident, or a transitional amount pursuant to 
      sub-paragraph (ii); 

      a Contracting Party may establish for the maximum of 10 years from the 
      date of the opening for signature of this Convention, a transitional 
      amount of at least 150 million SDRs in respect of a nuclear incident 
      occurring within that period. 

    beyond the amount made available under sub-paragraph (a), the Contracting 
    Parties shall make available public funds according to the formula specified 
    in Article IV. 

    Compensation for nuclear damage in accordance with paragraph 1(a) shall be 
    distributed equitably without discrimination on the basis of nationality, 
    domicile or residence, provided that the law of the Installation State may, 
    subject to obligations of that State under other conventions on nuclear 
    liability, exclude nuclear damage suffered in a non-Contracting 

    Compensation for nuclear damage in accordance with paragraph 1(b), shall, 
    subject to Articles V and XI.1(b), be distributed equitably without 
    discrimination on the basis of nationality, domicile or residence. 
  If the nuclear damage to be compensated does not require the total amount 
  under paragraph 1(b), the contributions shall be reduced proportionally. 

  The interest and costs awarded by a court in actions for compensation of 
  nuclear damage are payable in addition to the amounts awarded pursuant to 
  paragraphs 1(a) and (b) and shall be proportionate to the actual contributions 
  made pursuant to paragraphs 1(a) and (b), respectively, by the operator 
  liable, the Contracting Party in whose territory the nuclear installation of 
  that operator is situated, and the Contracting Parties together. 

Article IV

Calculation of Contributions
  The formula for contributions according to which the Contracting Parties shall 
  make available the public funds referred to in Article III.1(b) shall be 
  determined as follows: 

      the amount which shall be the product of the installed nuclear capacity of 
      that Contracting Party multiplied by 300 SDRs per unit of installed 
      capacity; and 

      the amount determined by applying the ratio between the United Nations 
      rate of assessment for that Contracting Party as assessed for the year 
      preceding the year in which the nuclear incident occurs, and the total of 
      such rates for all Contracting Parties to 10% of the sum of the amounts 
      calculated for all Contracting Parties under sub-paragraph (i). 
    Subject to sub-paragraph (c), the contribution of each Contracting Party 
    shall be the sum of the amounts referred to in sub-paragraphs (a)(i) and 
    (ii), provided that States on the minimum United Nations rate of assessment 
    with no nuclear reactors shall not be required to make contributions. 

    The maximum contribution which may be charged per nuclear incident to any 
    Contracting Party, other than the Installation State, pursuant to 
    sub-paragraph (b) shall not exceed its specified percentage of the total of 
    contributions of all Contracting Parties determined pursuant to 
    sub-paragraph (b). For a particular Contracting Party, the specified 
    percentage shall be its UN rate of assessment expressed as a percentage plus 
    8 percentage points. If, at the time an incident occurs, the total installed 
    capacity represented by the Parties to this Convention is at or above a 
    level of 625,000 units, this percentage shall be increased by one percentage 
    point. It shall be increased by one additional percentage point for each 
    increment of 75,000 units by which the capacity exceeds 625,000 units. 
  The formula is for each nuclear reactor situated in the territory of the 
  Contracting Party, 1 unit for each MW of thermal power. The formula shall be 
  calculated on the basis of the thermal power of the nuclear reactors shown at 
  the date of the nuclear incident in the list established and kept up to date 
  in accordance with Article VIII. 

  For the purpose of calculating the contributions, a nuclear reactor shall be 
  taken into account from that date when nuclear fuel elements have been first 
  loaded into the nuclear reactor. A nuclear reactor shall be excluded from the 
  calculation when all fuel elements have been removed permanently from the 
  reactor core and have been stored safely in accordance with approved 
  procedures. 

Article V

Geographical Scope
  The funds provided for under Article III.1(b) shall apply to nuclear damage 
  which is suffered: 

    in the territory of a Contracting Party; or 

    in or above maritime areas beyond the territorial sea of a Contracting 
    Party: 

      on board or by a ship flying the flag of a Contracting Party, or on board 
      or by an aircraft registered in the territory of a Contracting Party, or 
      on or by an artificial island, installation or structure under the 
      jurisdiction of a Contracting Party; or 

      by a national of a Contracting Party; 

      excluding damage suffered in or above the territorial sea of a State not 
      Party to this Convention; or 

    in or above the exclusive economic zone of a Contracting Party or on the 
    continental shelf of a Contracting Party in connection with the exploitation 
    or the exploration of the natural resources of that exclusive economic zone 
    or continental shelf; 

    provided that the courts of a Contracting Party have jurisdiction pursuant 
    to Article XIII. 

  Any signatory or acceding State may, at the time of signature of or accession 
  to this Convention or on the deposit of its instrument of ratification, 
  declare that for the purposes of the application of paragraph 1(b)(ii), 
  individuals or certain categories thereof, considered under its law as having 
  their habitual residence in its territory, are assimilated to its own 
  nationals. 

  In this article, the expression "a national of a Contracting Party" shall 
  include a Contracting Party or any of its constituent sub-divisions, or a 
  partnership, or any public or private body whether corporate or not 
  established in the territory of a Contracting Party. 

CHAPTER III
ORGANIZATION OF SUPPLEMENTARY FUNDING

Article VI 

Notification of Nuclear Damage
Without prejudice to obligations which Contracting Parties may have under other 
international agreements, the Contracting Party whose courts have jurisdiction 
shall inform the other Contracting Parties of a nuclear incident as soon as it 
appears that the damage caused by such incident exceeds, or is likely to exceed, 
the amount available under Article III.1(a) and that contributions under Article 
III.1(b) may be required. The Contracting Parties shall without delay make all 
the necessary arrangements to settle the procedure for their relations in this 
connection.
Article VII
Call for Funds
  Following the notification referred to in Article VI, and subject to Article 
  X.3, the Contracting Party whose courts have jurisdiction shall request the 
  other Contracting Parties to make available the public funds required under 
  Article III.1(b) to the extent and when they are actually required and shall 
  have exclusive competence to disburse such funds. 

  Independently of existing or future regulations concerning currency or 
  transfers, Contracting Parties shall authorize the transfer and payment of any 
  contribution provided pursuant to Article III.1(b) without any restriction. 

Article VIII 

List of Nuclear Installations
  Each Contracting State shall, at the time when it deposits its instrument of 
  ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, communicate to the Depositary 
  a complete listing of all nuclear installations referred to in Article IV.3. 
  The listing shall contain the necessary particulars for the purpose of the 
  calculation of contributions. 

  Each Contracting State shall promptly communicate to the Depositary all 
  modifications to be made to the list. Where such modifications include the 
  addition of a nuclear installation, the communication must be made at least 
  three months before the expected date when nuclear material will be introduced 
  into the installation. 

  If a Contracting Party is of the opinion that the particulars, or any 
  modification to be made to the list communicated by a Contracting State 
  pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2, do not comply with the provisions, it may 
  raise objections thereto by addressing them to the Depositary within three 
  months from the date on which it has received notice pursuant to paragraph 5. 
  The Depositary shall forthwith communicate this objection to the State to 
  whose information the objection has been raised. Any unresolved differences 
  shall be dealt with in accordance with the dispute settlement procedure laid 
  down in Article XVI. 

  The Depositary shall maintain, update and annually circulate to all 
  Contracting States the list of nuclear installations established in accordance 
  with this Article. Such list shall consist of all the particulars and 
  modifications referred to in this Article, it being understood that objections 
  submitted under this Article shall have effect retrospective to the date on 
  which they were raised, if they are sustained. 

  The Depositary shall give notice as soon as possible to each Contracting Party 
  of the communications and objections which it has received pursuant to this 
  Article. 

Article IX

Rights of Recourse
  Each Contracting Party shall enact legislation in order to enable both the 
  Contracting Party in whose territory the nuclear installation of the operator 
  liable is situated and the other Contracting Parties who have paid 
  contributions referred to in Article III.1(b), to benefit from the operator's 
  right of recourse to the extent that he has such a right under either one of 
  the Conventions referred to in Article I or national legislation mentioned in 
  Article II.1(b) and to the extent that contributions have been made by any of 
  the Contracting Parties. 

  The legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory the nuclear 
  installation of the operator liable is situated may provide for the recovery 
  of public funds made available under this Convention from such operator if the 
  damage results from fault on his part. 

  The Contracting Party whose courts have jurisdiction may exercise the rights 
  of recourse provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 on behalf of the other 
  Contracting Parties which have contributed. 

Article X 

Disbursements, Proceedings
  The system of disbursements by which the funds required under Article III.1 
  are to be made available and the system of apportionment thereof shall be that 
  of the Contracting Party whose courts have jurisdiction. 

  Each Contracting Party shall ensure that persons suffering damage may enforce 
  their rights to compensation without having to bring separate proceedings 
  according to the origin of the funds provided for such compensation and that 
  Contracting Parties may intervene in the proceedings against the operator 
  liable. 

  No Contracting Party shall be required to make available the public funds 
  referred to in Article III.1(b) if claims for compensation can be satisfied 
  out of the funds referred to in Article III.1(a). 

Article XI 

Allocation of Funds
The funds provided under Article III.1(b) shall be distributed as follows:
  50% of the funds shall be available to compensate claims for nuclear damage 
  suffered in or outside the Installation State; 

  50% of the funds shall be available to compensate claims for nuclear damage 
  suffered outside the territory of the Installation State to the extent that 
  such claims are uncompensated under sub-paragraph (a). 

  In the event the amount provided pursuant to Article III.1(a) is less than 300 
  million SDRs: 

    the amount in paragraph 1(a) shall be reduced by the same percentage as the 
    percentage by which the amount provided pursuant to Article III.1(a) is less 
    than 300 million SDRs; and 

    the amount in paragraph 1(b) shall be increased by the amount of the 
    reduction calculated pursuant to sub-paragraph (i). 

  If a Contracting Party, in accordance with Article III.1(a), has ensured the 
  availability without discrimination of an amount not less than 600 million 
  SDRs, which has been specified to the Depositary prior to the nuclear 
  incident, all funds referred to in Article III.1(a) and (b) shall, 
  notwithstanding paragraph 1, be made available to compensate nuclear damage 
  suffered in and outside the Installation State. 

CHAPTER IV
EXERCISE OF OPTIONS

Article XII 

  Except insofar as this Convention otherwise provides, each Contracting Party 
  may exercise the powers vested in it by virtue of the Vienna Convention or the 
  Paris Convention, and any provisions made thereunder may be invoked against 
  the other Contracting Parties in order that the public funds referred to in 
  Article III.1(b) be made available. 

  Nothing in this Convention shall prevent any Contracting Party from making 
  provisions outside the scope of the Vienna or the Paris Convention and of this 
  Convention, provided that such provision shall not involve any further 
  obligation on the part of the other Contracting Parties, and provided that 
  damage in a Contracting Party having no nuclear installations within its 
  territory shall not be excluded from such further compensation on any grounds 
  of lack of reciprocity. 

    Nothing in this Convention shall prevent Contracting Parties from entering 
    into regional or other agreements with the purpose of implementing their 
    obligations under Article III.1(a) or providing additional funds for the 
    compensation of nuclear damage, provided that this shall not involve any 
    further obligation under this Convention for the other Contracting Parties. 

    A Contracting Party intending to enter into any such agreement shall notify 
    all other Contracting Parties of its intention. Agreements concluded shall 
    be notified to the Depositary. 

CHAPTER V
JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW

Article XIII 

Jurisdiction
  Except as otherwise provided in this article, jurisdiction over actions 
  concerning nuclear damage from a nuclear incident shall lie only with the 
  courts of the Contracting Party within which the nuclear incident occurs. 

  Where a nuclear incident occurs within the area of the exclusive economic zone 
  of a Contracting Party or, if such a zone has not been established, in an area 
  not exceeding the limits of an exclusive economic zone, were one to be 
  established by that Party, jurisdiction over actions concerning nuclear damage 
  from that nuclear incident shall, for the purposes of this Convention, lie 
  only with the courts of that Party. The preceding sentence shall apply if that 
  Contracting Party has notified the Depositary of such area prior to the 
  nuclear incident. Nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted as permitting 
  the exercise of jurisdiction in a manner which is contrary to the 
  international law of the sea, including the United Nations Convention on the 
  Law of the Sea. However, if the exercise of such jurisdiction is inconsistent 
  with the obligations of that Party under Article XI of the Vienna Convention 
  or Article 13 of the Paris Convention in relation to a State not Party to this 
  Convention jurisdiction shall be determined according to those provisions. 

  Where a nuclear incident does not occur within the territory of any 
  Contracting Party or within an area notified pursuant to paragraph 2, or where 
  the place of a nuclear incident cannot be determined with certainty, 
  jurisdiction over actions concerning nuclear damage from the nuclear incident 
  shall lie only with the courts of the Installation State. 

  Where jurisdiction over actions concerning nuclear damage would lie with the 
  courts of more than one Contracting Party, these Contracting Parties shall 
  determine by agreement which Contracting Party's courts shall have 
  jurisdiction. 

  A judgment that is no longer subject to ordinary forms of review entered by a 
  court of a Contracting Party having jurisdiction shall be recognized except: 

    where the judgment was obtained by fraud; 

    where the party against whom the judgment was pronounced was not given a 
    fair opportunity to present his case; or 

    where the judgment is contrary to the public policy of the Contracting Party 
    within the territory of which recognition is sought, or is not in accord 
    with fundamental standards of justice. 

  A judgment which is recognized under paragraph 5 shall, upon being presented 
  for enforcement in accordance with the formalities required by the law of the 
  Contracting Party where enforcement is sought, be enforceable as if it were a 
  judgment of a court of that Contracting Party. The merits of a claim on which 
  the judgment has been given shall not be subject to further proceedings. 

  Settlements effected in respect of the payment of compensation out of the 
  public funds referred to in Article III.1(b) in accordance with the conditions 
  established by national legislation shall be recognized by the other 
  Contracting Parties. 

Article XIV

Applicable Law
  Either the Vienna Convention or the Paris Convention or the Annex to this 
  Convention, as appropriate, shall apply to a nuclear incident to the exclusion 
  of the others. 

  Subject to the provisions of this Convention, the Vienna Convention or the 
  Paris Convention, as appropriate, the applicable law shall be the law of the 
  competent court. 

Article XV

Public International Law
This Convention shall not affect the rights and obligations of a Contracting 
Party under the general rules of public international law.

CHAPTER VI
DISPUTE SETTLEMENT

Article XVI 
 
  In the event of a dispute between Contracting Parties concerning the 
  interpretation or application of this Convention, the parties to the dispute 
  shall consult with a view to the settlement of the dispute by negotiation or 
  by any other peaceful means of settling disputes acceptable to them. 

  If a dispute of this character referred to in paragraph 1 cannot be settled 
  within six months from the request for consultation pursuant to paragraph 1, 
  it shall, at the request of any party to such dispute, be submitted to 
  arbitration or referred to the International Court of Justice for decision. 
  Where a dispute is submitted to arbitration, if, within six months from the 
  date of the request, the parties to the dispute are unable to agree on the 
  organization of the arbitration, a party may request the President of the 
  International Court of Justice or the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
  to appoint one or more arbitrators. In cases of conflicting requests by the 
  parties to the dispute, the request to the Secretary-General of the United 
  Nations shall have priority. 

  When ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to this Convention, a State 
  may declare that it does not consider itself bound by either or both of the 
  dispute settlement procedures provided for in paragraph 2. The other 
  Contracting Parties shall not be bound by a dispute settlement procedure 
  provided for in paragraph 2 with respect to a Contracting Party for which such 
  a declaration is in force. 

  A Contracting Party which has made a declaration in accordance with paragraph 
  3 may at any time withdraw it by notification to the Depositary.

ANNEX


A Contracting Party which is not a Party to any of the Conventions mentioned in 
Article I(a) or (b) of this Convention shall ensure that its national 
legislation is consistent with the provisions laid down in this Annex insofar as 
those provisions are not directly applicable within that Contracting Party. A 
Contracting Party having no nuclear installation on its territory is required to 
have only that legislation which is necessary to enable such a Party to give 
effect to its obligations under this Convention.

Article 1
Definitions
  In addition to the definitions in Article I of this Convention, the following 
  definitions apply for the purposes of this Annex: 

    "Nuclear Fuel" means any material which is capable of producing energy by a 
    self-sustaining chain process of nuclear fission. 

    "Nuclear Installation" means: 

      any nuclear reactor other than one with which a means of sea or air 
      transport is equipped for use as a source of power, whether for propulsion 
      thereof or for any other purpose; 

      any factory using nuclear fuel for the production of nuclear material, or 
      any factory for the processing of nuclear material, including any factory 
      for the re-processing of irradiated nuclear fuel; and 

      any facility where nuclear material is stored, other than storage 
      incidental to the carriage of such material; 

      provided that the Installation State may determine that several nuclear 
      installations of one operator which are located at the same site shall be 
      considered as a single nuclear installation. 
    "Nuclear material" means: 
      nuclear fuel, other than natural uranium and depleted uranium, capable of 
      producing energy by a self-sustaining chain process of nuclear fission 
      outside a nuclear reactor, either alone or in combination with some other 
      material; and 

      radioactive products or waste. 

    "Operator", in relation to a nuclear installation, means the person 
    designated or recognized by the Installation State as the operator of that 
    installation. 

    "Radioactive products or waste" means any radioactive material produced in, 
    or any material made radioactive by exposure to the radiation incidental to, 
    the production or utilization of nuclear fuel, but does not include 
    radioisotopes which have reached the final stage of fabrication so as to be 
    usable for any scientific, medical, agricultural, commercial or industrial 
    purpose. 

  An Installation State may, if the small extent of the risks involved so 
  warrants, exclude any nuclear installation or small quantities of nuclear 
  material from the application of this Convention, provided that: 

    with respect to nuclear installations, criteria for such exclusion have been 
    established by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy 
    Agency and any exclusion by an Installation State satisfies such criteria; 
    and 

    with respect to small quantities of nuclear material, maximum limits for the 
    exclusion of such quantities have been established by the Board of Governors 
    of the International Atomic Energy Agency and any exclusion by an 
    Installation State is within such established limits. 
  The criteria for the exclusion of nuclear installations and the maximum limits 
  for the exclusion of small quantities of nuclear material shall be reviewed 
  periodically by the Board of Governors. 

Article 2
Conformity of Legislation
  The national law of a Contracting Party is deemed to be in conformity with the 
  provisions of Articles 3, 4, 5 and 7 if it contained on 1 January 1995 and 
  continues to contain provisions that: 

    provide for strict liability in the event of a nuclear incident where there 
    is substantial nuclear damage off the site of the nuclear installation where 
    the incident occurs; 

    require the indemnification of any person other than the operator liable for 
    nuclear damage to the extent that person is legally liable to provide 
    compensation; and 

    ensure the availability of at least 1000 million SDRs in respect of a civil 
    nuclear power plant and at least 300 million SDRs in respect of other civil 
    nuclear installations for such indemnification. 

  If in accordance with paragraph 1, the national law of a Contracting Party is 
  deemed to be in conformity with the provision of Articles 3, 4, 5 and 7, then 
  that Party: 

    may apply a definition of nuclear damage that covers loss or damage set 
    forth in Article I(f) of this Convention and any other loss or damage to the 
    extent that the loss or damage arises out of or results from the radioactive 
    properties, or a combination of radioactive properties with toxic, explosive 
    or other hazardous properties of nuclear fuel or radioactive products or 
    waste in, or of nuclear material coming from, originating in, or sent to, a 
    nuclear installation; or other ionizing radiation emitted by any source of 
    radiation inside a nuclear installation, provided that such application does 
    not affect the undertaking by that Contracting Party pursuant to Article III 
    of this Convention; and 

    may apply the definition of nuclear installation in paragraph 3 of this 
    Article to the exclusion of the definition in Article 1.1(b) of this Annex. 

  For the purpose of paragraph 2 (b) of this Article, "nuclear installation" 
  means: 

    any civil nuclear reactor other than one with which a means of sea or air 
    transport is equipped for use as a source of power, whether for propulsion 
    thereof or any other purpose; and 

    any civil facility for processing, reprocessing or storing: 

      irradiated nuclear fuel; or 

      radioactive products or waste that: 

        result from the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel and contain 
        significant amounts of fission products; or 

        contain elements that have an atomic number greater than 92 in 
        concentrations greater than 10 nano-curies per gram. 

    any other civil facility for processing, reprocessing or storing nuclear 
    material unless the Contracting Party determines the small extent of the 
    risks involved with such an installation warrants the exclusion of such a 
    facility from this definition. 

  Where that national law of a Contracting Party which is in compliance with 
  paragraph 1 of this Article does not apply to a nuclear incident which occurs 
  outside the territory of that Contracting Party, but over which the courts of 
  that Contracting Party have jurisdiction pursuant to Article XIII of this 
  Convention, Articles 3 to 11 of the Annex shall apply and prevail over any 
  inconsistent provisions of the applicable national law. 

Article 3
Operator Liability
  The operator of a nuclear installation shall be liable for nuclear damage upon 
  proof that such damage has been caused by a nuclear incident: 

    in that nuclear installation; or 

    involving nuclear material coming from or originating in that nuclear 
    installation, and occurring: 

      before liability with regard to nuclear incidents involving the nuclear 
      material has been assumed, pursuant to the express terms of a contract in 
      writing, by the operator of another nuclear installation; 

      in the absence of such express terms, before the operator of another 
      nuclear installation has taken charge of the nuclear material; or 

      where the nuclear material is intended to be used in a nuclear reactor 
      with which a means of transport is equipped for use as a source of power, 
      whether for propulsion thereof or for any other purpose, before the person 
      duly authorized to operate such reactor has taken charge of the nuclear 
      material; but 

      where the nuclear material has been sent to a person within the territory 
      of a non-Contracting State, before it has been unloaded from the means of 
      transport by which it has arrived in the territory of that non-Contracting 
      State; 

    involving nuclear material sent to that nuclear installation, and occurring: 

      after liability with regard to nuclear incidents involving the nuclear 
      material has been assumed by the operator pursuant to the express terms of 
      a contract in writing, from the operator of another nuclear installation; 

      in the absence of such express terms, after the operator has taken charge 
      of the nuclear material; or 

      after the operator has taken charge of the nuclear material from a person 
      operating a nuclear reactor with which a means of transport is equipped 
      for use as a source of power, whether for propulsion thereof or for any 
      other purpose; but 

      where the nuclear material has, with the written consent of the operator, 
      been sent from a person within the territory of a non-Contracting State, 
      only after it has been loaded on the means of transport by which it is to 
      be carried from the territory of that State; 

    provided that, if nuclear damage is caused by a nuclear incident occurring 
    in a nuclear installation and involving nuclear material stored therein 
    incidentally to the carriage of such material, the provisions of 
    sub-paragraph (a) shall not apply where another operator or person is solely 
    liable pursuant to sub-paragraph (b) or (c). 

  The Installation State may provide by legislation that, in accordance with 
  such terms as may be specified in that legislation, a carrier of nuclear 
  material or a person handling radioactive waste may, at such carrier or such 
  person's request and with the consent of the operator concerned, be designated 
  or recognized as operator in the place of that operator in respect of such 
  nuclear material or radioactive waste respectively. In this case such carrier 
  or such person shall be considered, for all the purposes of this Convention, 
  as an operator of a nuclear installation situated within the territory of that 
  State. 

  The liability of the operator for nuclear damage shall be absolute. 

  Whenever both nuclear damage and damage other than nuclear damage have been 
  caused by a nuclear incident or jointly by a nuclear incident and one or more 
  other occurrences, such other damage shall, to the extent that it is not 
  reasonably separable from the nuclear damage, be deemed to be nuclear damage 
  caused by that nuclear incident. Where, however, damage is caused jointly by a 
  nuclear incident covered by the provisions of this Annex and by an emission of 
  ionizing radiation not covered by it, nothing in this Annex shall limit or 
  otherwise affect the liability, either as regards any person suffering nuclear 
  damage or by way of recourse or contribution, of any person who may be held 
  liable in connection with that emission of ionizing radiation. 

    No liability shall attach to an operator for nuclear damage caused by a 
    nuclear incident directly due to an act of armed conflict, hostilities, 
    civil war or insurrection. 

    Except insofar as the law of the Installation State may provide to the 
    contrary, the operator shall not be liable for nuclear damage caused by a 
    nuclear incident caused directly due to a grave natural disaster of an 
    exceptional character. 

  National law may relieve an operator wholly or partly from the obligation to 
  pay compensation for nuclear damage suffered by a person if the operator 
  proves the nuclear damage resulted wholly or partly from the gross negligence 
  of that person or an act or omission of that person done with the intent to 
  cause damage. 

  The operator shall not be liable for nuclear damage: 

    to the nuclear installation itself and any other nuclear installation, 
    including a nuclear installation under construction, on the site where that 
    installation is located; and 

    to any property on that same site which is used or to be used in connection 
    with any such installation; 

    unless otherwise provided by national law, to the means of transport upon 
    which the nuclear material involved was at the time of the nuclear incident. 
    If national law provides that the operator is liable for such damage, 
    compensation for that damage shall not have the effect of reducing the 
    liability of the operator in respect of other damage to an amount less than 
    either 150 million SDRs, or any higher amount established by the legislation 
    of a Contracting Party. 

  Nothing in this Convention shall affect the liability outside this Convention 
  of the operator for nuclear damage for which by virtue of paragraph 7(c) he is 
  not liable under this Convention. 

  The right to compensation for nuclear damage may be exercised only against the 
  operator liable, provided that national law may permit a direct right of 
  action against any supplier of funds that are made available pursuant to 
  provisions in national law to ensure compensation through the use of funds 
  from sources other than the operator. 

  The operator shall incur no liability for damage caused by a nuclear incident 
  outside the provisions of national law in accordance with this Convention. 

Article 4
Liability Amounts
  Subject to Article III.1(a)(ii), the liability of the operator may be limited 
  by the Installation State for any one nuclear incident, either: 

    to not less than 300 million SDRs; or 

    to not less then 150 million SDRs provided that in excess of that amount and 
    up to at least 300 million SDRs public funds shall be made available by that 
    State to compensate nuclear damage. 

  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the Installation State, having regard to the 
  nature of the nuclear installation or the nuclear substances involved and to 
  the likely consequences of an incident originating therefrom, may establish a 
  lower amount of liability of the operator, provided that in no event shall any 
  amount so established be less than 5 million SDRs, and provided that the 
  Installation State ensures that public funds shall be made available up to the 
  amount established pursuant to paragraph 1. 

  The amounts established by the Installation State of the liable operator in 
  accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2, as well as the provisions of any 
  legislation of a Contracting Party pursuant to Article 3.7(c) shall apply 
  wherever the nuclear incident occurs. 

Article 5 
Financial Security

    The operator shall be required to have and maintain insurance or other 
    financial security covering his liability for nuclear damage in such amount, 
    of such type and in such terms as the Installation State shall specify. The 
    Installation State shall ensure the payment of claims for compensation for 
    nuclear damage which have been established against the operator by providing 
    the necessary funds to the extent that the yield of insurance or other 
    financial security is inadequate to satisfy such claims, but not in excess 
    of the limit, if any, established pursuant to Article 4. Where the liability 
    of the operator is unlimited, the Installation State may establish a limit 
    of the financial security of the operator liable provided that such limit is 
    not lower than 300 million SDRs. The Installation State shall ensure the 
    payment of claims for compensation for nuclear damage which have been 
    established against the operator to the extent that yield of the financial 
    security is inadequate to satisfy such claims, but not in excess of the 
    amount of the financial security to be provided under this paragraph. 

    Notwithstanding sub-paragraph (a), the Installation State, having regard to 
    the nature of the nuclear installation or the nuclear substances involved 
    and to the likely consequences of an incident originating therefrom, may 
    establish a lower amount of financial security of the operator, provided 
    that in no event shall any amount so established be less than 5 million 
    SDRs, and provided that the Installation State ensures the payment of claims 
    for compensation for nuclear damage which have been established against the 
    operator by providing necessary funds to the extent that the yield of 
    insurance or other financial security is inadequate to satisfy such claims, 
    and up to the limit provided in sub-paragraph (a). 

  Nothing in paragraph 1 shall require a Contracting Party or any of its 
  constituent sub-divisions to maintain insurance or other financial security to 
  cover their liability as operators. 

  The funds provided by insurance, by other financial security or by the 
  Installation State pursuant to paragraph 1 or Article 4.1(b) shall be 
  exclusively available for compensation due under this Annex. 

  No insurer or other financial guarantor shall suspend or cancel the insurance 
  or other financial security provided pursuant to paragraph 1 without giving 
  notice in writing of at least two months to the competent public authority or, 
  in so far as such insurance or other financial security relates to the 
  carriage of nuclear material, during the period of the carriage in question. 

Article 6
Carriage
  With respect to a nuclear incident during carriage, the maximum amount of 
  liability of the operator shall be governed by the national law of the 
  Installation State. 

  A Contracting Party may subject carriage of nuclear material through its 
  territory to the condition that the amount of liability of the operator be 
  increased to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount of liability of the 
  operator of a nuclear installation situated in its territory. 

  The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply to: 

    carriage by sea where, under international law, there is a right of entry in 
    cases of urgent distress into ports of a Contracting Party or a right of 
    innocent passage through its territory; 

    carriage by air where, by agreement or under international law, there is a 
    right to fly over or land on the territory of a Contracting Party. 

Article 7 
Liability of More Than One Operator
  Where nuclear damage engages the liability of more than one operator, the 
  operators involved shall, in so far as the damage attributable to each 
  operator is not reasonably separable, be jointly and severally liable. The 
  Installation State may limit the amount of public funds made available per 
  incident to the difference, if any, between the amounts hereby established and 
  the amount established pursuant to Article 4.1. 

  Where a nuclear incident occurs in the course of carriage of nuclear material, 
  either in one and the same means of transport, or, in the case of storage 
  incidental to the carriage, in one and the same nuclear installation, and 
  causes nuclear damage which engages the liability of more than one operator, 
  the total liability shall not exceed the highest amount applicable with 
  respect to any one of them pursuant to Article 4. 

  In neither of the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall the liability 
  of any one operator exceed the amount applicable with respect to him pursuant 
  to Article 4. 

  Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3, where several nuclear 
  installations of one and the same operator are involved in one nuclear 
  incident, such operator shall be liable in respect of each nuclear 
  installation involved up to the amount applicable with respect to him pursuant 
  to Article 4. The Installation State may limit the amount of public funds made 
  available as provided for in paragraph 1. 

Article 8 
Compensation Under National Law
  For purposes of this Convention, the amount of compensation shall be 
  determined without regard to any interest or costs awarded in a proceeding for 
  compensation of nuclear damage. 

  Compensation for damage suffered outside the Installation State shall be 
  provided in a form freely transferable among Contracting Parties. 

  Where provisions of national or public health insurance, social insurance, 
  social security, workmen's compensation or occupational disease compensation 
  systems include compensation for nuclear damage, rights of beneficiaries of 
  such systems and rights of recourse by virtue of such systems shall be 
  determined by the national law of the Contracting Party in which such systems 
  have been established or by the regulations of the intergovernmental 
  organization which has established such systems. 

Article 9 
Period of Extinction
  Rights of compensation under this Convention shall be extinguished if an 
  action is not brought within ten years from the date of the nuclear incident. 
  If, however, under the law of the Installation State the liability of the 
  operator is covered by insurance or other financial security or by State funds 
  for a period longer than ten years, the law of the competent court may provide 
  that rights of compensation against the operator shall only be extinguished 
  after a period which may be longer than ten years, but shall not be longer 
  than the period for which his liability is so covered under the law of the 
  Installation State. 

  Where nuclear damage is caused by a nuclear incident involving nuclear 
  material which at the time of the nuclear incident was stolen, lost, 
  jettisoned or abandoned, the period established pursuant to paragraph 1 shall 
  be computed from the date of that nuclear incident, but the period shall in no 
  case, subject to legislation pursuant to paragraph 1, exceed a period of 
  twenty years from the date of the theft, loss, jettison or abandonment. 

  The law of the competent court may establish a period of extinction or 
  prescription of not less than three years from the date on which the person 
  suffering nuclear damage had knowledge or should have had knowledge of the 
  damage and of the operator liable for the damage, provided that the period 
  established pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be exceeded. 

  If the national law of a Contracting Party provides for a period of extinction 
  or prescription greater than ten years from the date of a nuclear incident, it 
  shall contain provisions for the equitable and timely satisfaction of claims 
  for loss of life or personal injury filed within ten years from the date of 
  the nuclear incident. 

Article 10 
Right of Recourse
National law may provide that the operator shall have a right of recourse only: 
  if this is expressly provided for by a contract in writing; or 

  if the nuclear incident results from an act or omission done with intent to 
  cause damage, against the individual who has acted or omitted to act with such 
  intent. 

Article 11 
Applicable Law
Subject to the provisions of this Convention, the nature, form, extent and 
equitable distribution of compensation for nuclear damage caused by a nuclear 
incident shall be governed by the law of the competent court.
