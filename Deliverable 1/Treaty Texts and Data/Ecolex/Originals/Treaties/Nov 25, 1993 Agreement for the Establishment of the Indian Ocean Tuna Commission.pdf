AGREEMENT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INDIAN OCEAN TUNA COMMISSION
 

PREAMBLE
The Contracting Parties,
Recognizing the desirability of promoting the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans, and the equitable and efficient utilization and conservation of their living resources,
Desiring to contribute to the realization of a just and equitable international economic order, with due regard to the special interests and needs of developing countries,
Desiring to cooperate with a view to ensuring the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Indian Ocean and promoting their optimum utilization, and the sustainable development of the fisheries,
Recognizing, in particular, the special interests of developing countries in the Indian Ocean Region to benefit equitably from the fishery resources,
Considering the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea opened for signature on 10 December 1982 and, in particular, Articles 56, 64 and 116 to 119 thereof,
Considering that the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species and the sustainable and rational utilization of tuna resources in the Indian Ocean would be greatly enhanced by the establishment of cooperative measures by both the coastal states of the Indian Ocean and other States whose nationals harvest tuna and tuna-like species in the region,
Bearing in mind the Western Indian Ocean Tuna Organization Convention which was opened for signature on 19 June 1991,
