appropriate legislative, administrative or other relevant measures
to prevent and eliminate pollution in order to promote the
ecological restoration of the Baltic Sea Area and the preservation
of its ecological balance.

2.   The Contracting Parties shall apply the precautionary
principle, i.e., to take preventive measures when there is reason
to assume that substances or energy introduced, directly or
indirectly, into the marine environment may create hazards to human
health, harm living resources and marine ecosystems, damage
amenities or interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea even
when there is no conclusive evidence of a causal relationship
between inputs and their alleged effects.

Area the Contracting Parties shall promote the use of Best
Environmental Practice and Best Available Technology.  If the
reduction of inputs, resulting from the use of Best Environmental
Practice and Best Available Technology, as described in Annex II,
does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional
measures shall be applied.

4.   The Contracting Parties shall apply the polluter-pays
principle.

5.   The Contracting Parties shall ensure that measurements and
calculations of emissions from point sources to water and air and
of inputs from diffuse sources to water and air are carried out in
a scientifically appropriate manner in order to assess the state of
the marine environment of the Baltic Sea Area and ascertain the
implementation of this Convention.

6.   The Contracting Parties shall use their best endeavours to
ensure that the implementation of this Convention does not cause
transboundary pollution in areas outside the Baltic Sea Area.

Harmful substances

Part I - General principles

1.0  Introduction

     In order to fulfil the requirements of relevant parts of this
Convention the following procedure shall be used by the Contracting
Parties in identifying and evaluating harmful substances, as
defined in article 2, paragraph 7.

1.1  Criteria on the allocation of substances

     The identification and evaluation of substances shall be based
on the intrinsic properties of substances, namely:

 -    persistency;

 -    toxicity or other noxious properties;

 -    tendency to bioaccumulation.

as well as on characteristics liable to cause pollution, such as:

 -    the ratio between observed concentrations and concentrations
     having no observed effect;

 -    transboundary or long-range significance;

 -    risk of undesirable changes in the marine ecosystem and
     irreversibility or durability of effects;

 -    radioactivity;

 -    serious interference with harvesting of sea-foods or with
     other legitimate uses of the sea;

 -    distribution pattern (i.e. quantities involved, use pattern
     and liability to reach the marine environment);


 -    proven carcinogenic, teratogenic or mutagenic properties in or
     through the marine environment.

     These characteristics are not necessarily of equal importance
for the identification and evaluation of a particular substance or
group of substances.

1.2  Priority groups of harmful substances

     The Contracting Parties shall, in their preventive measures,
give priority to the following groups of substances which are
generally recognized as harmful substances:

(a)  heavy metals and their compounds;

slimicides and chemicals used for the preservation of wood, timber,
wood pulp, cellulose, paper, hides and textiles;

(e)  oils and hydrocarbons of petroleum origin;

(f)  other organic compounds especially harmful to the marine
environment;

(g)  nitrogen and phosphorus compounds;

(h)  radioactive substances, including wastes;

(i)  persistent materials which may float, remain in suspension or
sink;

(j)  substances which cause serious effects on taste and/or smell
of products for human consumption from the sea, or effects on
taste, smell, colour, transparency or other characteristics of the
water.

ANNEX II

Criteria for use of best environmental Practice and best
available technology

Regulation 1; General provisions


1.   In accordance with the relevant parts of this Convention,
the Contracting Parties shall apply the criteria for Best
Environmental Practice and Best Available Technology described
below.

2.   In order to prevent and eliminate pollution the Contracting
Parties shall use Best Environmental Practice for all sources and
Best Available Technology for point sources, minimizing or
eliminating inputs to water and air from all sources by providing
control strategies.

Regulation 2; Best Environmental Practice

     The term "Best Environmental Practice", is taken to mean the
application of the most appropriate combination of measures.  In
selecting for individual cases, at least the following graduated
range of measures should be considered:

 -    provision of information and education to the public and to
      users about the environmental consequences of choosing
      particular activities and products, their use and final
      disposal;

 -    the development and application of Codes of Good
      Environmental Practice covering all aspects of activity in
      the product's life;

 -    mandatory labels informing the public and users of
      environmental risks related to a product, its use and final
      disposal;

 -    availability of collection and disposal systems;

 -    saving of resources, including energy;

 -    recycling, recovery and reuse;

 -    avoiding the use of hazardous substances and products and
     the generation of hazardous waste;

 -    application of economic instruments to activities, products
     or groups of products and emissions;

 -    a system of licensing involving a range of restrictions or a
     ban.

2.   In determining in general or individual cases what
combination of measures constitute Best Environmental practice,
particular consideration should be given to:

 -    the precautionary principle;

 -    the ecological risk associated with the product, its
     production, use and final disposal;

 -    potential environmental benefit or penalty of substitute
     materials or activities;

 -    advances and changes in scientific knowledge and
     understanding;

 -    time-limits for implementation;

 -    social and economic implications.

Regulation 3; Best Available Technology

1.   The term "Best Available Technology" is taken to mean the
latest stage of development (state of the art) of processes, of
facilities or of methods of operation which indicate the
practical suitability of a particular measure for limiting
discharges.

2.   In determining whether a set of processes, facilities and
methods of operation constitute the Best Available Technology in
general or individual cases, special consideration should be
given to:

 -    comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation
     which have recently been successfully tried out;

 -    technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge
     and understanding;

 -    the economic feasibility of such technology;

 -    time-limits for application;

 -    the nature and volume of the emissions concerned;

 -    non-waste/low-waste technology;

 -    the precautionary principle.

Regulation 4; Future developments

     It therefore follows that "Best Environmental Practice" and
"Best Available Technology" will change with time in the light of
technological advances and economic and social factors, as well
as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.
