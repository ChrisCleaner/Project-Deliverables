CONVENTION ON THIRD PARTY LIABILITY IN THE FIELD OF NUCLEAR ENERGY

Adopted at Paris on 29 July 1960


      Text incorporating the provisions of the Additional Protocol
to the Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear
Energy signed in Paris on 28 January 1964.

      The Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, the
Republic of Austria, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark,
Spain, the French Republic, the Kingdom of Greece, the Italian
Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of Norway, the
Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Portuguese Republic, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kingdom of
Sweden, the Swiss Confederation and the Turkish Republic;

      Considering that the European Nuclear Energy Agency,
established within the framework of the Organization for European
Economic co-operation (hereinafter referred to as the
"Organization"), is charged with encouraging the elaboration and
harmonization of legislation relating to nuclear energy in
participating countries, in particular with regard to third party
liability and insurance against atomic risks;

      Desirous of ensuring adequate and equitable compensation for
persons who suffer damage caused by nuclear incidents whilst taking
the necessary steps to ensure that the development of the production
and uses of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is not thereby
hindered;

      Convinced of the need for unifying the basic rules applying in
the various countries to the liability incurred for such damage,
whilst leaving these countries free to take, on a national basis,
any additional measures which they deem appropriate including the
application of the provisions of this Convention to damage caused by
incidents due to ionizing radiations not covered therein;

Have agreed as follows:


Article 1

a)    For the purposes of this Convention: 

      (i)  "A nuclear incident" means any occurrence or succession
           of occurrences having the same origin which causes
           damage, provided that such occurrence or succession of
           occurrences, or any of the damage caused, arises out of
           or results from the radioactive properties, or a
           combination of radioactive properties with toxic,
           explosive, or other hazardous properties of nuclear fuel
           or radioactive products or waste or with any to them. 

      (ii) Nuclear installations means reactors other than those
           comprised in any means or transport; factories for the
           manufacture or processing of nuclear substances;
           factories for the separation of isotopes of nuclear fuel;
           factories for the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear
           fuel; facilities for the storage of nuclear substances
           other than storage incidental to the carriage of such
           substances, and such other installations in which there
           are nuclear fuel or radioactive products or waste as the
           Steering Committee of the European Nuclear Agency
           (hereinafter referred to as the "Steering Committee")
           shall from time to time determine.

      (iii) "Nuclear fuel" means fissionable material in the form of
           uranium metal, alloy, or chemical compound (including
           natural uranium), plutonium metal, alloy, or compound,
           and such other fissionable material as the Steering
           Committee shall from time to time determine.

      (iv) "Radioactive products or waste" means any radioactive
           material produced in or made radioactive by exposure to
           the radiation incidental to the process of producing or
           utilizing nuclear fuel, but does not include (1) nuclear
           fuel, or (2) radioisotopes outside a nuclear installation
           which are used or intended to be used for any industrial,
           commercial, agricultural, medical or scientific purpose.

      (v)  "Nuclear substances" means nuclear fuel (other than
           natural uranium and other than depleted uranium) and
           radioactive products or waste.

      (vi) "Operator" in relation to a nuclear installation means
           the person designated or recognized by the competent
           public authority as the operator of that installation.

b)    The Steering Committee may, if in its view the small extent of
the risks involved so warrants, exclude any nuclear installation,
nuclear fuel, or nuclear substances from the application of this
Convention.


Article 2

      This Convention does not apply to nuclear incidents occurring
in the territory of non-Contracting States or to damage suffered in
such territory, unless otherwise provided by the legislation of the
Contracting Party in whose territory the nuclear installation of the
operator liable is situated, and except in regard to rights referred
to in Article 6 (e).


Article 3 

a)    The operator of a nuclear installation shall be liable, in
accordance with this Conventions for:

      (i)  damage to or loss of life of any person; and

      (ii) damage to or loss of any property other than

                 1.the nuclear installation itself and any property on
                 the site of that installation which is used or to be
                 used in connection with that installation;

                 2.in the cases within Article 4, the means of
                 transport upon which the nuclear substances involved
                 were at the time of the nuclear incident, upon proof
                 that such damage or loss (hereinafter referred to as
                 "damage") was caused by a nuclear incident involving
                 either nuclear fuel or radioactive products or waste
                 in, or nuclear substances coming from such
                 installation, except as otherwise provided for in
                 Article 4.

b)    Where the damage or loss is caused jointly by a
nuclear incident and by an incident other than a nuclear incident,
that part of the damage or loss which is caused by such other
incident shall, to the extent that it is not reasonably separable
from the damage or loss caused by the nuclear incident, be
considered to be damage caused by the nuclear incident. Where the
damage or loss is caused jointly by a nuclear incident and by an
emission of ionizing radiation not covered by this Convention,
nothing in this Convention shall limit or otherwise affect the
liability of any person in connection with that emission of ionizing
radiation.

c)    Any Contracting Party may by legislation provide that the
liability of the operator of a nuclear installation situated in its
territory shall include liability for damage which arises out of or
results from ionizing radiations emitted by any source of radiation
inside that installation, other than those referred to in paragraph
(a) of this Article.


Article 4

      In the case of carriage of nuclear substances, including
storage incidental thereto, without prejudice to Article 2:

a)    The operator of a nuclear installation shall be liable, in
accordance with this Convention, for damage upon proof that it was
caused by a nuclear incident outside that installation and involving
nuclear substances in the course of carriage therefrom, only if the
incident occurs:

      (i)  before liability with regard to nuclear incidents
           involving the nuclear substances has been assumed,
           pursuant to the express terms of a contract in writing,
           by the operator of another nuclear installation;

      (ii) in the absence of such express terms, before the operator
           of another nuclear installation has taken charge of the
           nuclear substances; or

      (iii) where the nuclear substances are intended to be used in
           a reactor comprised in a means of transport, before the
           person duly authorized to operate that reactor has taken
           charge of the nuclear substances; but

      (iv) where the nuclear substances have been sent to a person
           within the territory of a non-Contracting State, before
           they have been unloaded from the means of transport by
           which they have arrived in the territory of that
           non-Contracting State.

b)    The operator of a nuclear installation shall be liable, in
accordance with this Convention, for damage upon proof that it was
caused by a nuclear incident outside that installation and involving
nuclear substances in the course of carriage thereto, only if the
incident occurs:

      (i)  after liability with regard to nuclear incidents
           involving the nuclear substances has been assumed by him
           pursuant to the express terms of a contract in writing,
           from the operator of another nuclear installation;

      (ii) in the absence of such express terms, after he has taken
           charge of the nuclear substances; or

      (iii) after he has taken charge of the nuclear substances from
           a person operating a reactor comprised in a means of
           transport; but

      (iv) where the nuclear substances have, with the written
           consent of the operator, been sent from a person within
           the territory of a non-Contracting State, after they have
           been loaded on the means of transport by which they are
           to be carried from the territory of that State.

c)    The operator liable in accordance with this Convention shall
provide the carrier with a certificate issued by or on behalf of the
insurer or other financial guarantor furnishing the security
required pursuant to Article 10. The certificate shall state the
name and address of that operator and the amount, type and duration
of the security, and these statements may not be disputed by the
person by whom or on whose behalf the certificate was issued. The
certificate shall also indicate the nuclear substances and the
carriage in respect of which the security applies and shall include
a statement by the competent public authority that the person named
is an operator within the meaning of this Convention.

d)    A Contracting Party may provide by legislation that, under
such terms as may be contained therein and upon fulfilment of the
requirements of Article 10 (a), a carrier may, at his request and
with the consent of an operator of a nuclear installation situated
in its territory, by decision of the competent public authority, be
liable in accordance with this Convention in place of that operator.
In such case for all the purposes of this Convention the carrier
shall be considered, in respect of nuclear incidents occurring in
the course of carriage of nuclear substances, as an operator of a
nuclear installation on the territory of the Contracting Party whose
legislation so provides.


Article 5 

a)    If the nuclear fuel or radioactive products or waste involved
in a nuclear incident have been in more than one nuclear
installation and are in a nuclear installation at the time damage is
caused no operator of any nuclear installation in which they have
previously been shall be liable for the damage.

b)    Where, however, damage is caused by a nuclear incident
occurring in a nuclear installation and involving only nuclear
substances stored therein incidentally to their carriage, the
operator of the nuclear installation shall not be liable where
another operator or person is liable pursuant to Article 4.

c)    If the nuclear fuel or radioactive products or waste involved
in a nuclear incident have been in more than one nuclear
installation and are not in a nuclear installation at the time
damage is caused, no operator other than the operator of the last
nuclear installation in which they were before the damage was caused
or an operator who has subsequently taken them in charge shall be
liable for the damage.

d)    If damage gives rise to liability of more than one operator in
accordance with this Convention, the liability of these operators
shall be joint and several: provided that where such liability
arises as a result of damage caused by a nuclear incident a
involving nuclear substances in the course of carriage in one and
the same means of transport, or, in the case of storage incidental
to the carriage, in one and the same nuclear installation, the
maximum total amount for which such operators shall be liable shall
be the highest amount established with respect to any of them
pursuant to Article 7 and provided that in no case shall any one
operator be required, in respect of a nuclear incident, to pay more
than the amount established with respect to him pursuant to Article
7.


Article 6

a)    The right to compensation for damage caused by a nuclear
incident may be exercised only against an operator liable for the
damage in accordance with this Convention, or, if a direct right of
action against the insurer or other financial guarantor furnishing
the security required pursuant to Article 10 is given by national
law, against the insurer or other financial guarantor.

b)    Except as otherwise provided in this Article, no other person
shall be liable for damage caused by a nuclear incident, but this
provision shall not affect the application or any international
agreement in the field of transport in force or open for signature,
ratification or accession at the date of this Convention.

c)    (i)  Nothing in this Convention shall affect the liability:

                 1.of any individual for damage caused by a nuclear
                 incident for which the operator, by virtue of
                 Articles 3 (a) (ii) (1) and (2) or Article 9, is not
                 liable under this Convention and which results from
                 an act or omission of that individual done with
                 intent to cause damage;

                 2.of a person duly authorized to operate a reactor
                 comprised in a means of transport for damage caused
                 by a nuclear incident when an operator is not liable
                 for such damage pursuant to Article 4 (a) (iii) or
                 (b) (iii).

      (ii) The operator shall incur no liability outside this
           Convention for damage caused by a nuclear incident except
           where use has not been made of the right provided for in
           Article 7 (c), and then only to the extent that national
           legislation or the legislation of the Contracting Party
           in whose territory the nuclear installation of the
           operator liable is situated has made specific provisions concerning 
           damage to the means of transport. 

d)    Any person who has paid compensation in respect of damage
caused by a nuclear incident under any international agreement
referred to in paragraph (b) of this Article or under any
legislation of a non-Contracting State shall, up to the amount which
he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights under this Convention
of the person suffering damage whom he has so compensated.

e)    Any person who has his principal place of business in the
territory of a Contracting Party or who is the servant of such a
person and who has paid compensation in respect of damage caused by
nuclear incident occurring in the territory of a non-Contracting
State or in respect of damage offered in such territory shall, up to
the amount which he has paid, acquire the rights which the person so
compensated would have had against the operator but for the
provisions of Article 2.

f)    The operator shall have a right of recourse only:

      (i)  if the damage caused by a nuclear incident results from
           an act or omission done with intent to cause damage,
           against the individual acting or omitting to act with
           such intent;

      (ii) if and to the extent that it is so provided expressly by
           the contract.

g)    If the operator has a right of recourse to any extent pursuant
to paragraph (f) of this Article against any person, that person
shall not, to that extent, have a right against the operator under
paragraphs (d) or (e) of this Article.

h)    Where provisions of national or public health insurance,
social security, workmen's compensation or occupational disease
compensation systems include compensation for damage caused by a
nuclear incident, rights of beneficiaries of such systems and rights
of recourse by virtue of such systems shall be determined by the law
of the Contracting Party or by the regulations of the
inter-Governmental organization which has established such systems.


Article 7

a)    The aggregate of compensation required to be paid in respect
of damage caused by a nuclear incident shall not exceed the maximum
liability established in accordance with this Article.

b)    The maximum liability of the operator in respect of damage
caused by a nuclear incident shall be 15,000,000 European Monetary
Agreement units of account as defined at the date of this Convention
(hereinafter referred to as "units of account"): provided that any
Contracting Party, taking into account the possibilities for the
operator of obtaining the insurance or other financial security
required pursuant to Article 10, may establish by legislation a
greater or less amount, but in no event less than 5,000,000 units of
account. The sums mentioned above may be converted into national
currency in round figures.

c)    Any Contracting Party may by legislation provide that the
exception in Article 3 (a) (ii) (2) shall not apply: provided that
in no case shall the inclusion of damage to the means of transport
result in reducing the liability of the operator in respect of other
damage to an amount less than 5,000,000 units of account.

d)    The amount of liability of operators of nuclear installations
in the territory of a Contracting Party established in accordance
with paragraph (b) of this Article as well as the provisions of any
legislation of a Contracting Party pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
Article shall apply to the liability of such operators wherever the
nuclear incident occurs.

e)    A Contracting Party may subject the transit of nuclear
substances through its territory to the condition that the maximum
amount of liability of the foreign operator concerned be increased,
if it considers that such amount does not adequately cover the risks
of a nuclear incident in the course of the transit: provided that
the maximum amount thus increased shall not exceed the maximum
amount of liability of operators of nuclear installations situated
in its territory.

f)    The provisions of paragraph (e) of this Article shall not
apply:

      (i)  to carriage by sea where, under international law, there
           is a right of entry in cases of urgent distress into the
           ports of such Contracting Party or a right of innocent
           passage through its territory; or 

      (ii) to carriage by air where, by agreement or under
           international law there is a right to fly over or land on
           the territory of such Contracting Party. 

g)    Any interest and costs awarded by a court in actions for
compensation under this Convention shall not be considered to be
compensation for the purposes of this Convention and shall be
payable by the operator in addition to any sum for which he is
liable in accordance with this Article.


Article 8 

a)    The right of compensation under this Convention shall be
extinguished if an action is not brought within ten years from the
date of the nuclear incident. National legislation may, however,
establish a period longer than ten years if measures have been taken
by the Contracting Party in whose territory the nuclear installation
of the operator liable is situated to cover the liability for that
operator in respect of any actions for compensation begun after the
expiry of the period of ten years and during such longer period:
provided that such extension of the extinction period shall in no
case affect the right of compensation under this Convention of any
person who has brought an action in respect of loss of life or
personal injury against the operator before the expiry of the period
of ten years.

b)    In the case of damage caused by a nuclear incident involving
nuclear fuel or radioactive products or waste which, at the time of
the incident have been stolen, lost, jettisoned or abandoned and
have not yet been recovered, the period established pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Article shall be computed from the date of
that nuclear incident, but the period shall in no case exceed twenty
years from the date of the theft, loss, jettison or abandonment.

c)    National legislation may establish a period of not less than
two years from the extinction of the right or as a period of
limitation either from the date at which the person suffering damage
has knowledge or from the date at which he ought reasonably to have
known of both the damage and the operator liable: provided that the
period established pursuant to paragraph (a) and (b) of this Article
shall not be exceeded.

d)    Where the provisions of Article 13(c) (ii) are applicable, the
right of compensation shall not however, be extinguished if, within
the time provided for in paragraph (a) of this Article,

      (i)  prior to the determination by the Tribunal referred to in
           Article 17, an action has been brought before any of the
           courts from which the Tribunal can choose; if the
           Tribunal determines that the competent court is a court
           other than that before which such action has already been
           brought, it may fix a date by which such action has to be
           brought before the competent court so determined; or

      (ii) a request has been made to a Contracting Party concerned
           to initiate a determination by the Tribunal of the
           competent court pursuant to Article 13 (c) (ii) and an
           action is brought subsequent to such determination within
           such time as may be fixed by the Tribunal.

e)    Unless national law provides to the contrary, any person
suffering damage caused by a nuclear incident who has brought an
action for compensation within the period provided for in this
Article may amend his claim in respect of any aggravation of the
damage after the expiry of such period provided that final judgment
has not been entered by the competent court.


Article 9

      The operator shall not be liable for damage caused by a
nuclear incident directly due to an act of armed conflict,
hostilities, civil war, insurrection or, except in so far as the
legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory his nuclear
installation is situated may provide to the contrary, a grave
natural disaster of an exceptional character.


Article 10

a)    To cover the liability under this Convention, the operator
shall be required to have and maintain insurance or other financial
security of the amount established pursuant to Article 7 and of such
type and terms as the competent public authority shall specify.

b)    No insurer or other financial guarantor shall suspend or
cancel the insurance or other financial security provided for in
paragraph (a) of this Article without giving notice in writing of at
least two months to the competent public authority or in so far as
such insurance or other financial security relates to the carriage
of nuclear substances, during the period of the carriage in
question.

c)    The sums provided as insurance, reinsurance, or other
financial security may be drawn upon only for compensation for
damage caused by a nuclear Incident.


Article 11

      The nature, form and extent of the compensation, within the

Article 13

a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Article jurisdiction over
actions under Articles 3, 4, 6 (a) and 6 (e) shall lie only with the
courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the nuclear
incident occurred.

b)    Where a nuclear incident occurs outside the territory of the
Contracting Parties, or where the place of the nuclear incident
cannot be determined with certainty, jurisdiction over such actions
shall lie with the courts of the Contracting Parties in whose
territory the nuclear installation of the operator liable is
situated.

c)    Where jurisdiction would lie with the courts of more than one
Contracting Party by virtue of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this
Article, jurisdiction shall lie,

      (i)  if the nuclear incident occurred partly outside the
           territory of any Contracting Party and partly in the
           territory of a single Contracting Party, with the courts
           of that Contracting Party; and

      (ii) in any other case, with the courts of the Contracting
           Party determined, at the request of a Contracting Party
           concerned, by the Tribunal referred to in Article 17 as
           being the most closely related to the case in question.

d)    Judgments entered by the competent court under this Article
after trial, or by default, shall, when they have become enforceable
under the law applied by that court, become enforceable in the
territory of any of the other Contracting Parties as soon as the
formalities required by the Contracting Party concerned have been
complied with. The merits of the case shall not be the subject of
further proceedings. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to
interim judgments.

e)    If an action is brought against a Contracting Party under this
Convention, such Contracting Party may not, except in respect of
measures of execution, invoke any jurisdictional immunities before
the court competent in accordance with this Article.


Article 14

a)    This Convention shall be applied without any discrimination
based upon nationality, domicile, or residence.
