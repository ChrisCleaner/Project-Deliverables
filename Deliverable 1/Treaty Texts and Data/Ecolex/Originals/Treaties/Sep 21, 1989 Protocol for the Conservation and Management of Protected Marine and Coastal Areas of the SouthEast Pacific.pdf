COASTAL AREAS OF THE SOUTH-EAST PACIFIC

      The High Contracting Parties,

      Recognizing the need to adopt appropriate measures for the
protection and preservation of those ecosystems which are fragile,
vulnerable or of unique natural value, and flora and fauna threatened
by depletion and extinction,

      Considering that it is in the common interest to endeavour to
manage coastal areas on the basis of a rational assessment of the
proper balance between conservation and development,

      Considering it necessary to establish protected areas with
special emphasis on parks, reserves, flora and fauna sanctuaries and
other such areas,

      Bearing in mind that all activities liable to have adverse
effects on the ecosystem, flora and fauna and their habitat must be
regulated, and

      Bearing in mind the 1981 Convention for the Protection of the
Marine Environment and Coastal Area of the South-East Pacific,

when the High Contracting Parties extend it beyond their 200 miles.

      The coastal zone, where interaction between land, sea and the
atmosphere is ecologically apparent, shall be determined by each State
Party, in accordance with the relevant scientific and technical
criteria.
