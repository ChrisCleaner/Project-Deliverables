their respective Amazonian regions as an integral part of their 
respective territories,

   Inspired by the common aim of pooling the efforts being made, 
both within their respective territories as well as among 
themselves, to promote the harmonious development of the Amazon 
region, to permit an equitable distribution of the benefits of 
said development among the Contracting Parties so as to raise the 
standard of living of their peoples and so as to achieve total 
incorporation of their Amazonian territories into their respective 
national economies,

matters pertaining to the promotion of regional development,

Contracting Parties shall facilitate fulfillment of these 
responsibilities, by continuing and expanding the joint efforts 
being made for the ecological conservation of the Amazon region,
