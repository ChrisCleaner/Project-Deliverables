CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT OF THE NORTH-
EAST ATLANTIC

Adopted at Paris on 22 September 1992


     The Contracting Parties,

     Recognising that the marine environment and the fauna and flora
which it supports are of vital importance to all nations;

     Recognising the inherent worth of the marine environment of the
North-East Atlantic and the necessity for providing co-ordinated
protection for it;

     Recognising that concerted action at national, regional and
global levels is essential to prevent and eliminate marine pollution
and to achieve sustainable management of the maritime area, that is,
the management of human activities in such a manner that the marine
ecosystem will continue to sustain the legitimate uses of the sea and
will continue to meet the needs of present and future generations;

     Mindful that the ecological equilibrium and the legitimate uses
of the sea are threatened by pollution;

     Considering the recommendations of the United Nations Conference
on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in June 1972;

     Considering also the results of the United Nations Conference on
the Environment and Development held in Rio Janeiro in June 1992;

     Recalling the relevant provisions of customary international law
reflected in Part XII of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention
and, in particular, Article 197 on global and regional co-operation
for the protection and preservation of the marine environment;

     Considering that the common interests of States concerned with
the same marine area should induce them to co-operate at regional or
sub-regional levels;

     Recalling the positive results obtained within the context of the
Convention for the prevention of marine pollution by dumping from
ships and aircraft signed in Oslo on 15th February 1972, as amended by
the protocols of 2nd March 1983 and 5th December 1989, and the
Convention for the prevention of marine pollution from land-based
sources signed in Paris on 4th June 1974, as amended by the protocol
of 26th March 1986;

     Convinced that further international action to prevent and
eliminate pollution of the sea should be taken without delay, as part
of progressive and coherent measures to protect the marine
environment;

     Recognising that it may be desirable to adopt, on the regional
level, more stringent measures with respect to the prevention and
elimination of pollution of the marine environment or with respect to
the protection of the marine environment against the adverse effects
of human activities than are provided for in international conventions
or agreements with a global scope;

     Recognising that questions relating to the management of
fisheries are appropriately regulated under international and regional
agreements dealing specifically with such questions;

     Considering that the present Oslo and Paris Conventions do not
adequately control some of the many sources of pollution, and that it
is therefore justifiable to replace them with the present Convention,
which addresses all sources of pollution of the marine environment and
the adverse effects of human activities upon it, takes into account
the precautionary principle and strengthens regional co-operation;

     Have agreed as follows:

Annex IV

On the Assessment of the Quality of the Marine Environment

Article 1

1.   For the purposes of this Annex "monitoring" means the repeated
measurement of:

(a)  the quality of the marine environment and each of its
compartments, that is, water, sediments and biota;

(b)  activities or natural and anthropogenic inputs which may affect
the quality of the marine environment;

(c)  the effects of such activities and inputs.

2.   Monitoring may be undertaken either for the purposes of ensuring
compliance with the Convention, with the objective of identifying
patterns and trends or for research purposes.

Article 2

     For the Purposes of this Annex, the Contracting Parties shall:

(a)  co-operate in carrying out monitoring programmes and submit the
resulting data to the Commission;


(b)  comply with quality assurance prescriptions and participate in
inter-calibration exercises;

(c)  use and develop, individually or preferably jointly, other duly
validated scientific assessment tools, such as modelling, remote
sensing and progressive risk assessment strategies;


(d)  carry out, individually or preferably jointly, research which is
considered necessary to assess the quality of the marine environment,
and to increase knowledge and scientific understanding of the marine
environment and, in particular, of the relationship between inputs,
concentration and effects:

(e)  take into account scientific progress which is considered to be
useful for such assessment purposes and which has been made elsewhere
either on the initiative of individual researchers and research
institutions, or through other national and international research
programmes or under the auspices of the European Economic Community or
other regional economic integration organisations.

Article 3

     For the purposes of this Annex, it shall, inter alia, be the duty
of the Commission:

(a)  to define and implement programmes of collaborative monitoring
and assessment-related research, to draw up codes of practice for the
guidance of participants in carrying out these monitoring programmes
and to approve the presentation and interpretation of their results;

(b)  to carry out assessments taking into account the results of
relevant monitoring and research and the data relating to inputs of
substances or energy into the maritime area which are provided by
virtue of other Annexes to the Convention, as well as other relevant
information;

(c)  to seek, where appropriate, the advice or services of competent
regional organisations and other competent international organisations
and competent bodies with a view to incorporating the latest results
of scientific research;

(d)  to co-operate with competent regional organisations and other
competent international organisations in carrying out quality status
assessments.


Appendix 1

Criteria for the Definition of Practices and Techniques Mentioned in
Paragraph 3(h)(i) of Article 2 of the Convention

Best available techniques

1.   The use of the best available techniques shall emphasise the use
of non-waste technology, if available.

2.   The term "best available techniques" means the latest stage of
development (state of the art) of processes, of facilities or of
methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of a
particular measure for limiting discharges, emissions and waste in
determining whether a set of processes, facilities and methods of
operation constitute the best available techniques in general or
individual cases, special consideration shall be given to:

(a)  comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which
have recently been successfully tried out;

(b)  technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and
understanding;

(c)  the economic feasibility of such techniques;

(d)  time limits for installation in both new and existing plants;

(e)  the nature and volume of the discharges and emissions concerned.

3.   It therefore follows that what is "best available techniques" for
a particular process will change with time in the light of
technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as
changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.

4.   If the reduction of discharges and emissions resulting from the
use of best available techniques does not lead to environmentally
acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied.

5.   "Techniques" include both the technology used and the way in
which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and
dismantled.

Best environmental practice

6)   The term "best environmental practice" means the application of
the most appropriate combination of environmental control measures and
strategies.  In making a selection for individual cases, at least the
following graduated range of measures should be considered:

(a)  the provision of information and education to the public and to
users about the environmental consequences of choice of particular
activities and choice of products, their use and ultimate disposal;

(b)  the development and application of codes of good environmental
practice which covers all aspects of the activity in the product's
life;

(c)  the mandatory application of labels informing users of
environmental risks related to a product, its use and ultimate
disposal;

(d)  saving resources, including energy;

(e)  making collection and disposal systems available to the public;

(f)  avoiding the use of hazardous substances or products and the
generation of hazardous waste;

(g)  recycling, recovery and re-use;


(h)  the application of economic instruments to activities, products
or groups of products;

(i)  establishing a system of licensing, involving a range of
restrictions or a ban.

7.   In determining what combination of measures constitute best
environmental practice, in general or individual cases, particular
consideration should be given to:

(a)  the environmental hazard of the product and its production, use
and ultimate disposal;

(b)  the substitution by less polluting activities or substances;

(c)  the scale of use;

(d)  the potential environmental benefit or penalty of substitute
materials or activities;

(e)  advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;

(f)  time limits for implementation;

(g)  social and economic implications.

8.   It therefore follows that best environmental practice for a
particular source will change with time in the light of technological
advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in
scientific knowledge and understanding.

9.   If the reduction of inputs resulting from the use of best
environmental practice does not lead to environmentally acceptable
results, additional measures have to be applied and best environmental
practice redefined.


Appendix 2

Criteria Mentioned in Paragraph 2 of Article 1 of Annex 1 and in
Paragraph 2 of Article 2 of Annex III

1.   When setting priorities and in assessing the nature and extent of
the programmes and measures and their time scales, the Contracting
Parties shall use the criteria given below;

(a)  persistency;

(b)  toxicity or other noxious properties;

(c)  tendency to bioaccumulation;

(d)  radioactivity;

(e)  the ratio between observed or (where the results of observations
are not yet available) predicted concentrations and no observed effect
concentrations;

(f)  anthropogenically caused risk of eutrophication;

(g)  transboundary significance;

(h)  risk of undesirable changes in the marine ecosystem and
irreversibility or durability of effects;

(i)  interference with harvesting of seafoods or with other legitimate
uses of the sea;

(j)  effects on the taste and/or smell of products for human
consumption from the sea, or effects on smell, colour, transparency or
other characteristics of the water in the marine environment:

(k)  distribution pattern (i.e., quantities involved, use pattern and
liability to reach the marine environment);

(l)  non-fulfilment of environmental quality objectives.

2.   These criteria are not necessarily of equal importance for the
consideration of a particular substance or group of substances.

3.   The above criteria indicate that substances which shall be
subject to programmes and measures include:

(a)  heavy metals and their compounds;

(b)  organohalogen compounds (and substances which may form such com-
pounds in the marine environment);

(c)  organic compounds of phosphorus and silicon;

(d)  biocides such as pesticides, fungicides, herbicides,
insecticides, slimicides and chemicals used, inter alia, for the pre-
servation of wood, timber, wood pulp, cellulose, paper, hides and
textiles;

(e)  oils and hydrocarbons of pet
