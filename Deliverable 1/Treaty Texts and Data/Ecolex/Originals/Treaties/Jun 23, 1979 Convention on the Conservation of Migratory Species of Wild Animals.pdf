CONVENTION ON THE CONSERVATION OF MIGRATORY SPECIES
OF WILD ANIMALS

Adopted at Bonn on 23 June 1979


THE CONTRACTING PARTIES,

      RECOGNIZING that wild animals in their innumerable forms are an
      irreplaceable part of the earth's natural system which must be
      conserved for the good of mankind;

      AWARE that each generation of man holds the resources of the
      earth for future generations and has an obligation to ensure that
      this legacy is conserved and, where utilized, is used wisely;

      CONSCIOUS of the ever-growing value of wild animals from
      environmental, ecological, genetic, scientific, aesthetic,
      recreational, cultural, educational, social and economic points
      of view;

      CONCERNED particularly with those species of wild animals that
      migrate across or outside national jurisdictional boundaries;

      RECOGNIZING that the States are and must be the protectors of the
      migratory species of wild animals that live within or pass
      through their national jurisdictional boundaries;

      CONVINCED that conservation and effective management of migratory
      species of wild animals require the concerted action of all
      States within the national jurisdictional boundaries of which
      such species spend any part of their life cycle;

      RECALLING Recommendation 32 of the Action Plan adopted by the
      United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm,
      1972) and noted with satisfaction at the Twenty-seventh Session
      of the General Assembly of the United Nations,

      HAVE AGREED as follows:


Article I
Interpretation

1.    For the purpose of this Convention:

      a) "Migratory species" means the entire population or any
geographically separate part of the population of any species or lower
taxon of wild animals, a significant proportion of whose members
cyclically and predictably cross one or more national jurisdictional
boundaries;

      b) "Conservation status of a migratory species" means the sum of
the influences acting on the migratory species that may affect its
long-term distribution and abundance;

      c) "Conservation status" will be taken as "favourable" when:

      (1)  population dynamics data indicate that the migratory
           species is maintaining itself on a long-term basis as a
           viable component of its ecosystems;
      (2)  the range of the migratory species is neither currently
           being reduced, nor is likely to be reduced, on a long-term
           basis;
      (3)  there is, and will be in the foreseeable future, sufficient
           habitat to maintain the population of the migratory species
           on a long-term basis; and
      (4)  the distribution and abundance of the migratory species
           approach historic coverage and levels to the extent that
           potentially suitable ecosystems exist and to the extent
           consistent with wise wildlife management;

      d)   "Conservation status" will be taken as "unfavourable" if any
of the conditions set out in sub-paragraph (c) of this paragraph is not
met;

      e)   "Endangered" in relation to a particular migratory species
means that the migratory species is in danger of extinction throughout
all or a significant portion of its range;

      f)   "Range" means all the areas of land or water that a
migratory species inhabits, stays in temporarily, crosses or overflies
at any time on its normal migration route;

      g)   "Habitat" means any area in the range of a migratory species
which contains suitable living conditions for that species;

      h)   "Range State" in relation to a particular migratory species
means any State (and where appropriate any other Party referred to
under sub-paragraph (k) of this paragraph) that exercises jurisdiction
over any part of the range of that migratory species, or a State, flag
vessels of which are engaged outside national jurisdictional limits in
taking that migratory species;

      i)   "Taking" means taking, hunting, fishing, capturing,
harassing, deliberate killing, or attempting to engage in any such
conduct;

      j)   "AGREEMENT" means an international agreement relating to the
conservation of one or more migratory species as provided for in
Articles IV and V of this Convention; and

      k)   "Party" means a State or any regional economic integration
organization constituted by sovereign States which has competence in
respect of the negotiation, conclusion and application of international
agreements in matters covered by this Convention for which this
Convention is in force.

2.    In matters within their competence, the regional economic
integration organizations which are Parties to this Convention shall
in their own name exercise the rights and fulfil the responsibilities
which this Convention attributes to their member States. In such cases
the member States of these organizations shall not be entitled to
exercise such rights individually.

3.    Where this Convention provides for a decision to be taken by
either a two-thirds majority or a unanimous decision of "the Parties
present and voting" this shall mean "the Parties present and casting
an affirmative or negative vote". Those abstaining from voting shall
not be counted amongst "the Parties present and voting" in determining
the majority.


Article II
Fundamental Principles

1.    The Parties acknowledge the importance of migratory species being
conserved and of Range States agreeing to take action to this end
whenever possible and appropriate, paying special attention to
migratory species the conservation status of which is unfavourable, and
taking individually or in co-operation appropriate and necessary steps
to conserve such species and their habitat.

2.    The Parties acknowledge the need to take action to avoid any
migratory species becoming endangered.

3.    In particular, the Parties:

      a)   should promote, co-operate in and support research relating
to migratory species;

      b)   shall endeavour to provide immediate protection for
migratory species included in Appendix I; and,

      c)   shall endeavour to conclude AGREEMENTS covering the
conservation and management of migratory species included in Appendix
II.


Article III
Endangered Migratory Species: Appendix I

1.    Appendix I shall list migratory species which are endangered.

2.    A migratory species may be listed in Appendix I provided that
reliable evidence, including the best scientific evidence available,
indicates that the species is endangered.

3.    A migratory species may be removed from Appendix I when the
Conference of the Parties determines that:

      a)   reliable evidence, including the best scientific evidence
available, indicates that the species is no longer endangered, and

      b)   the species is not likely to become endangered again because
of loss of protection due to its removal from Appendix I.

4.    Parties that are Range States of a migratory species listed in
Appendix I shall endeavour:

      a)   to conserve and, where feasible and appropriate, restore
those habitats of the species which are of importance in removing the
species from danger of extinction;

      b)   to prevent, remove, compensate for or minimize, as
appropriate, the adverse effects of activities or obstacles that
seriously impede or prevent the migration of the species; and

      c)   to the extent feasible and appropriate, to prevent, reduce
or control factors that are endangering or are likely to further
endanger the species, including strictly controlling the introduction
of, or controlling or eliminating, already introduced exotic species.

5.    Parties that are Range States of a migratory species listed in
Appendix I shall prohibit the taking of animals belonging to such
species. Exceptions may be made to this prohibition only if:

      a)   the taking is for scientific purposes;

      b)   the taking is for the purpose of enhancing the propagation
or survival of the affected species;

      c)   the taking is to accommodate the needs of traditional
subsistence users of such species; or

      d)   extraordinary circumstances so require;

      provided that such exceptions are precise as to content and
limited in space and time. Such taking should not operate to the
disadvantage of the species.

6.    The Conference of the Parties may recommend to the Parties that
are Range States of a migratory species listed in Appendix I that they
take further measures considered appropriate to benefit the species.

7.    The Parties shall as soon as possible inform the Secretariat of
any exceptions made pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article.

Article IV
Migratory Species to Be the Subject of AGREEMENTS:

Appendix II

1.    Appendix II shall list migratory species which have an
unfavourable conservation status and which require international
agreements for their conservation and management, as well as those
which have a conservation status which would significantly benefit from
the international co-operation that could be achieved by an
international agreement.

2.    If the circumstances so warrant, a migratory species may be
listed both in Appendix I and Appendix II.

3.    Parties that are Range States of migratory species listed in
Appendix II shall endeavour to conclude AGREEMENTS where these would
benefit the species and should give priority to those species in an
unfavourable conservation status.

4.    Parties are encouraged to take action with a view to concluding
agreements for any population or any geographically separate part of
the population of any species or lower taxon of wild animals, members
of which periodically cross one or more national jurisdictional
boundaries.

5.    The Secretariat shall be provided with a copy of each AGREEMENT
concluded pursuant to the provisions of this Article.


Article V
Guidelines for AGREEMENTS

1.    The object of each AGREEMENT shall be to restore the migratory
species concerned to a favourable conservation status or to maintain
it in such a status. Each AGREEMENT should deal with those aspects of
the conservation and management of the migratory species concerned
which serve to achieve that object.

2.    Each AGREEMENT should cover the whole of the range of the
migratory species concerned and should be open to accession by all
Range States of that species, whether or not they are Parties to this
Convention.

of the Order Cetacea, any taking that is not permitted for that
migratory species under any other multilateral agreement and provide
for accession to the AGREEMENT by States that are not Range States of
that migratory species.

5.    Where appropriate and feasible, each AGREEMENT should provide
for, but not be limited to:

      a)   periodic review of the conservation status of the migratory
species concerned and the identification of the factors which may be
harmful to that status;

      b)   coordinated conservation and management plans;

      c)   research into the ecology and population dynamics of the
migratory species concerned, with special regard to migration;

concerned, special regard being paid to the exchange of the results of
research and of relevant statistics;

      e)   conservation and, where required and feasible, restoration
of the habitats of importance in maintaining a favourable conservation
status, and protection of such habitats from disturbances, including
strict control of the introduction of, or control of already
introduced, exotic species detrimental to the migratory species;

      f)   maintenance of a network of suitable habitats appropriately
disposed in relation to the migration route;

      g)   where it appears desirable, the provision of new habitats
