Conscious of their responsibility to protect, preserve and improve the environment of the South Pacific for the good health, benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations of the people of the South Pacific; 

Concerned about the growing threat to human health and the environment posed by the increasing generation of hazardous wastes and the disposal of such wastes by environmentally unsound methods;  

Concerned also about the dangers posed by radioactive wastes to the people and environment of the South Pacific; 

Aware that their responsibilities to protect, preserve and improve the environment of the South Pacific can be met only by cooperative effort among all peoples of the South Pacific based on an understanding of the needs and capacities of all Parties; 

Taking full account of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States adopted in Barbados on 6 May 1994; 

Noting with concern that a number of approaches have been made to certain Island Countries of the South Pacific by unscrupulous foreign waste dealers for the importation into and the disposal within the South Pacific of hazardous wastes generated in other countries; 

Concerned by the slowness of progress towards a satisfactory resolution of the issues surrounding international trade in goods which have been banned, cancelled or refused registration in the country of manufacture for human health or environmental reasons;  

Recalling their commitments under existing regional treaties and arrangements for the protection and preservation of the environment of the South Pacific, including the Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region, signed in Noumea on 24 November 1986, the Protocol concerning Cooperation in Combating Pollution Emergencies in the South Pacific Region, adopted by Parties on 25 November 1986, and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, signed in Rarotonga on 6 August 1985; 

Further Recalling the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal adopted by the Conference of the Plenipotentiaries on 22 March 1989, and noting decisions of its Conference of the Parties including Decision II 12 of 25 March 1994; 

Desiring to conclude an agreement under Article 11 of the Basel Convention; 

Mindful of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Code of Practice on the International Transboundary Movement of Radioactive Waste and recognising the need for its strict observance in the South Pacific Region; 

Noting as well the preliminary negotiations on a Convention on the Safe Management of Nuclear Waste; 

Further Recalling the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972), the Cairo Guidelines and Principles for the Environmentally Sound Management of Hazardous Wastes adopted by the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) by Decision 14/30 of 17 June 1987 and the Recommendations of the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (formulated in 1957 and updated biennially); 

Recalling also Agenda 21 adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro on 14 June 1992, which reaffirms that effective control of the generation, storage, treatment, recycling and reuse, transport, recovery, and disposal of hazardous wastes is of paramount importance for proper health, environmental protection and natural resources management and sustainable development; 

Resolving to prohibit the importation of hazardous wastes into Pacific Island Developing Parties, and to regulate and facilitate the environmentally sound management of such wastes generated within the Convention Area; and 

Resolving also to prohibit the importation of all radioactive wastes into Pacific Island Developing Parties while at the same time recognising that the standards, procedures and the authorities responsible for the environmentally sound management of radioactive wastes will differ from those in respect of hazardous wastes. 

Have agreed as follows:

Such notification shall contain the declarations and information specified in Annex VI A of this Convention, written in a language acceptable to the importing Party. Only one notification needs to be sent to each country concerned. 

2. The importing Party shall acknowledge within reasonable time, which in the case of Other Parties shall not exceed fourteen working days, the receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. The importing Party shall have sixty days after issuing the acknowledgement to inform the notifier that it is consenting to the movement, with or without conditions, denying permission for the movement or requesting additional information. In the event that additional information has been sought, a new period of twenty one days recommences from the time of receipt of the additional information. 

3. The exporting Party shall not allow the transboundary movement until it has received: 

(a) Written consent of the importing Party; 

(b) Written consent from every transit Party; 

(c) Written consent of every non-Party country of transit; 

(d) Written confirmation from the importing Party of the existence of a contract between the exporter and the disposer specifying the environmentally sound management of the wastes in question; and
