SUPPLEMENTARY PROTOCOL TO THE AGREEMENT ON REGIONAL CO-OPERATION 
IN COMBATING POLLUTION OF THE SOUTH-EAST PACIFIC BY HYDROCARBONS 
OR OTHER HARMFUL SUBSTANCES

Quito, 22 July 1983


The High Contracting Parties,

Recognizing that the Agreement on Regional Cooperation in 
Combating Pollution of the South-East Pacific by Hydrocarbons or 
Other Harmful Substances in Cases of Emergency establishes 
general principles on the subject,

Considering that it is necessary to supplement those rules by 
specifying the co-operation mechanisms that would function in the 
event of a massive oil spill with which an individual country is 
unable to cope single-handedly, together with the contingency 
plan that each country should establish,

Bearing in mind that the high cost of the measures that should 
be adopted calls for a rational employment of equipment, material 
and experts so as to enhance the possibilities of making good use 
of external assistance,

Hereby agree as follows:


Article I 

CO-OPERATION MECHANISMS IN THE EVENT OF OIL SPILLS

(a) Each High Contracting Party shall designate the authority 
responsible for requesting or providing assistance in cases of 
emergency and shall keep the other High Contracting Parties 
informed of any change or designation for this purpose.

It shall also keep the other High Contracting Parties informed 
of the experts and equipment, material and other items which it 
is able to provide in cases of emergency.

(b) Requests for assistance shall be made by the most expeditious 
means, if possible by telex. Such requests should indicate the 
nature and scale of the assistance requested, stating the amount 
and type of such assistance and the approximate period for which 
it would be required.

The Executive Secretariat, in consultation with the High 
Contracting Parties, shall endeavour to establish a procedure for 
the fulfilment of such requests and for the exchange of 
information required in order to provide assistance in cases of 
emergency.

The requesting High Contracting Party should state exactly the 
number of experts it requires and the type, make and quantity of 
equipment and material required. It should also state how many 
trained personnel it has available to make use of such equipment 
and material and the supplementary equipment and installations 
needed in order to operate them.

The High Contracting Party or Parties to which a request has 
been addressed shall consider the assistance requested and shall 
take a decision as soon as possible, immediately stating the 
form, extent and conditions of the co-operation that they will 
provide.

(c) Without prejudice to the provisions of the second section of 
paragraph (a), the High Contracting Parties shall conduct a study 
of the existing stock of items that may be provided and their 
estimated cost, so that the Agreement may be implemented in cases 
of emergency, and in particular on:

      (i)     The rental cost of each item of spill control equipment, 
              including the payment of insurance coverage against
              possible damage and partial or total loss during the
              period for which assistance is extended;

      (ii)    The value of the material which they are able to provide
              in cases of emergency;

      (iii)   The cost of transporting the equipment and material from 
              the various places where they are stored to specific
              destinations in the other High Contracting Parties;

      (iv)    The cost of the participation of experts and trained 
              personnel in an assistance operation;

      (v)     The payment arrangements for the services, material and 
              equipment requested.

The figures arrived at by each High Contracting Party on the 
basis of the above-mentioned estimates shall reflect the actual 
cost of the co-operation to be extended. They shall not 
incorporate any earnings or profit for the High Contracting Party 
providing the assistance.

(d) Each High Contracting Party shall determine the approximate 
length of time during which it would be able to provide the 
assistance requested. In any case, it shall enjoy priority in the 
use of equipment and material should an emergency occur 
simultaneously in its own maritime area of sovereignty and 
jurisdiction.

A High Contracting Party receiving material undertakes to pay 
for it or replace it promptly, including the cost of carriage 
back to the place from which it came.

In each case the High Contracting Parties shall adopt the most 
appropriate and expeditious procedures for replacing any material 
they requested, taking account of the time required to purchase 
and transport it to its final destination.

(e) The High Contracting Parties shall keep a record of the 
amount and condition of the equipment and material dispatched and 
received. Once such goods have been received, any damage or loss, 
up to the time they are returned or reimbursed, shall be borne by 
the High Contracting Party requesting the assistance.

(f) The experts participating in emergency operations shall 
furnish advice to the authority officially designated in 
accordance with paragraph (a) and shall in no case be responsible 
for taking decisions. Such experts shall receive the same 
treatment as experts of international organizations in the same 
field.

(g) In view of the urgency of the co-operation requested, the 
customs and immigration services shall extend special concessions 
permitting the free movement of equipment, material and personnel 
necessary for the implementation of this Protocol; such 
equipment, material and personnel shall be granted appropriate 
exemptions so that timely and effective assistance can be 
afforded.
