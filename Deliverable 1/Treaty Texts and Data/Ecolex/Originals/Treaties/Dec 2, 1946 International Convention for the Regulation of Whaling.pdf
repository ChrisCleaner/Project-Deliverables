INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE REGULATION OF WHALING

Adopted at Washington on 2 December 1946


       The Governments whose duly authorized representatives have
subscribed hereto,

       Recognizing the interest of the nations of the world in
safeguarding for future generations the great nature resources
represented by the whale stocks;

       Considering that the history of whaling has been over-fishing of
one area after another and of one species of whale after another to
such a degree that it is essential to protect all species of whales
from further over-fishing;

       Recognizing that the whale stocks are susceptible of natural
increases if whaling is properly regulated, and that increases in the
size of whale stocks will permit increases in the numbers of whales
which may be captured without endangering these natural resources;

       Recognizing that it is in the common interest to achieve the
optimum level of whale stocks as rapidly as possible without causing
wide-spread economic and nutritional distress;

      Recognizing that in the course of achieving these objectives,
whaling operations should be confined to those species best able to
sustain exploitation in order to give an interval for recovery to
certain species of whales now depleted in numbers;

      Desiring to establish a system of international regulation for
the whale fisheries to ensure proper and effective conservation and
development of whale stocks on the basis of the principles embodied in
the provisions of the International Agreement for the Regulation of
Whaling signed in London on 8 June 1973 and the protocols to that
Agreement signed in London on 24 June 1938 and 26 November 1945; and

      Having decided to conclude a convention to provide for the proper
conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly
development of the whaling industry;

      Have agreed as follows:

Article I

1.    This Convention includes the Schedule attached thereto which
forms an integral part thereof. All references to "Convention" shall
be understood as including the said Schedule either in its present
terms or as amended in accordance with the provisions of Article V.

2.    This Convention applies to factory ships, land stations, and
whale catchers under the jurisdiction of the Contracting Governments,
and to all waters in which whaling is prosecuted by such factory ships,
land stations, and whale catchers.

Article II

      As used in this Convention:

1.    "factory ship" means a ship in which or on which whales are
treated whether wholly or in part;

2.    "land stations" means a factory on the land at which whales are
treated whether wholly or in part;

3.    "whale catcher" means a ship used for the purpose of hunting,
taking, towing, holding on to, or scouting for whales;

1.    The Contracting Governments agree to establish an International
Whaling Commission, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, to be
composed of one member from each Contracting Government. Each member
shall have one vote and may be accompanied by one or more experts and
advisers.

2.    The Commission shall elect from its own members a Chairman and
Vice Chairman and shall determine its own Rules of Procedure. Decisions
of the Commission shall be taken by a simple majority of those members
voting except that a three-fourths majority of those members voting
shall be required for action in pursuance of Article V. The Rules of
Procedure may provide for decisions otherwise than at meetings of the
Commission.

3.    The Commission may appoint its own Secretary and staff.

4.    The Commission may set up, from among its own members and experts

and advisers shall be determined and paid by his own Government.

6.    Recognizing that specialized agencies related to the United
Nations will be concerned with the conservation and development of
whale fisheries and the products arising therefrom and desiring to
avoid duplication of functions, the Contracting Governments will
consult among themselves within two years after the coming into force
of this Convention to decide whether the Commission shall be brought
within the framework of a specialized agency related to the United
Nations.

7.    In the meantime the Government of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland shall arrange, in consultation with the
other Contracting Governments to convene the first meeting of the
Commission, and shall initiate the consultation referred to in
paragraph 6 above.

8.    Subsequent meetings of the Commission shall be convened as the
Commission may determine.

Article IV

1.    The Commission may either in collaboration with or through
independent agencies of the Contracting Governments or other public or
private agencies, establishments, or organizations, or independently

Norway and other organizations and agencies such reports as it deems
appropriate, as well as statistical, scientific, and other pertinent
information relating to whales and whaling.

Article V

1.    The Commission may amend from time to time the provisions of the
Schedule by adopting regulations with respect to the conservation and
utilization of whale resources, fixing (a) protected and unprotected
species; (b) open and closed seasons; (c) open and closed waters,
including the designation of sanctuary areas; (d) size limits for each
species; (e) time, methods, and intensity of whaling (including the
maximum catch of whales to be taken in any one season); (f) types and
specifications of gear and apparatus and appliances which may be used;
(g) methods of measurement; and (h) catch returns and other statistical
and biological records.

2.    These amendments of the Schedule (a) shall be such as are
necessary to carry out the objectives and purposes of this Convention
and to provide for the conservation, development, and optimum
utilization of the whale resources, (b) shall be based on scientific
findings; (c) shall not involve restrictions on the number or
nationality of factory ships or land stations, nor allocate specific
quotas to any factory ship or land station or to any group of factory
ships or land stations, and (d) shall take into consideration the
interests of the consumers of whale products and the whaling industry.

3.    Each of such amendments shall become effective with respect to
the Contracting Governments ninety days following notification of the
amendment by the Commission to each of the Contracting Governments,
except that (a) if any Government presents to the Commission objection
to any amendment prior to the expiration of this ninety-day period, the
amendment shall not become effective with respect to any of the
Governments for an additional ninety days; (b) thereupon, any other
Contracting Government may present objection to the amendment at any
time prior to the expiration of the additional ninety-day period, or
before the expiration of thirty days from the date of receipt of the
last objection received during such additional ninety-day period,
whichever date shall be the later; and (c) thereafter, the amendment
shall become effective with respect to all Contracting Governments
which have not presented objection but shall not become effective with
respect to any Government which has so objected until such date as the
objection is withdrawn. The Commission shall notify each Contracting
Government immediately upon receipt of each objection and withdrawal
and each Contracting Government shall acknowledge receipt of all
notifications of amendments, objections and withdrawals.

4.    No amendments shall become effective before 1 July 1949.

twelve months during which the taking or killing of sperm whales by
whale catchers may be permitted; provided that a separate open season
may be declared for each factory ship and the whale catchers attached
thereto.

d)    Each Contracting Government shall declare for all factory ships
and whale catchers attached thereto under its jurisdiction one
continuous open season not to exceed six months out of any period of
twelve months during which the taking or killing of minke whales by the

accordance with sub-paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this paragraph. 

b)    Each Contracting Government shall declare for all land stations
under its jurisdiction, and whale catchers attached to such land
stations, one open season during which the taking or killing of baleen
whales, except minke whales, by the whale catchers shall be permitted.
Such open season shall be for a period of not more than six consecutive
months in any period of twelve months and shall apply to all land
stations under the jurisdiction of the Contracting Government; provided
that a separate open season may be declared for any land station used
for the taking or treating of baleen whales, except minke whales, which
is more than 1,000 miles from the nearest land station used for the
taking or treating of baleen whales, except minke whales, under the
jurisdiction of the same Contracting Government.

c)    Each Contracting Government shall declare for all land stations
under its jurisdiction and for whale catchers attached to such land
stations, one open season not to exceed eight continuous months in any
one period of twelve months, during which the taking or killing of
sperm whales by the whale catchers shall be permitted, provided that
a separate open season may be declared for any land station used for
the taking or treating of sperm whales which is more than 1,000 miles
from the nearest land station used for the taking or treating of sperm
whales under the jurisdiction of the same Contracting Government.

      Except that a separate open season may be declared for any land
station used for the taking or treating of minke whales which is
located in an area having oceanographic conditions clearly
distinguishable from those of the area in which are located the other
land stations used for the taking or treating of minke whales under the
jurisdiction of the same Contracting Government; but the declaration
of a separate open season by virtue of the provisions of this
sub-paragraph shall not cause thereby the period of time covering the
open seasons declared by the same Contracting Government to exceed nine
continuous months of any twelve months.

e)    The prohibitions contained in this paragraph shall apply to all
land stations as defined in Article II of the Whaling Convention of
1946 and to all factory ships which are subject to the regulations
governing the operation of land stations under the provisions of
paragraph 6 of this Schedule.
4.              It is forbidden to use a factory ship which has been used
during
a season in any waters south of 400 South Latitude for the purpose of
treating baleen whales, except minke whales, in any other area except
the North Pacific Ocean and its dependent waters north of the Equator
for the same purpose within a period of one year from the termination
of that season; provided that catch limits in the North Pacific Ocean
and dependent waters are established as provided in paragraph 10 and
15 of this Schedule and provided that this paragraph shall not apply
to a ship which has been used during the season solely for freezing or
salting the meat and entrails of whales intended for human food or
feeding animals.

Classification of Stocks

9.     All stocks of whales shall be classified in one of three
categories according to the advice of the Scientific Committee as
follows:

a)     A Sustained Management Stock (SMS) is a stock which is not more
than 10 per cent of Maximum Sustainable Yield (hereinafter referred to
as MSY) stock level below MSY stock level, and not more than 20 per
cent above that level; MSY being determined on the basis of the number
of whales.

       When a stock has remained at a stable level for a considerable
period under a regime of approximately constant catches, it shall be
classified as a Sustained Management Stock in the absence of any
positive evidence that it should be otherwise classified.

       Commercial whaling shall be permitted on Sustained Management
Stocks according to the advice of the Scientific Committee. These
stocks are listed in Tables 1 and 2 of this Schedule.

       For the 1978/79 pelagic season and the 1979 coastal season in the
Southern Hemisphere and for the 1979 season in all other areas for
stocks between the MSY stock level and 10 per cent below that level,
the permitted catch shall not exceed the number of whales obtained by
taking 90 per cent of the MSY and reducing that number by 10 per cent
for every 1 per cent by which the stock falls short of the MSY stock
level. For stocks at or above the MSY stock level, the permitted catch
shall not exceed 90 per cent of the MSY.

b)     An Initial Management Stock (IMS) is a stock more than 20 per
cent of MSY stock level above MSY stock level. Commercial whaling shall
be permitted on Initial Management Stocks according to the advice of
the Scientific Committee as to measures necessary to bring the stocks
to the MSY stock level and then optimum level in an efficient manner
and without risk of reducing them below this level. The permitted catch
for such stocks will be more than 90 per cent of MSY as far as this is
known, or, where it will be more appropriate, catching effort shall be
limited to that which will take 90 per cent of MSY in a stock at MSY
stock level.

       In the absence of any positive evidence that a continuing higher
percentage will not reduce the stock below the MSY stock level no more
than 5 per cent of the estimated initial exploitable stock shall be
taken in any one year. Exploitation should not commence until an
estimate of stock size has been obtained which is satisfactory in the
view of the Scientific Committee. Stocks classified as Initial
Management Stock are listed in Tables 1 and 2 of this Schedule. 

c)     A Protection Stock (PS) is a stock which is
below 10 per cent of MSY stock level below MSY stock level.
There shall be no commercial whaling on species or stocks whilst they
are classified as Protection Stocks.

       Species and stocks so classified are listed in Tables 1 and 2 of
this Schedule.

a)     Notwithstanding the other provisions of paragraph 9, there shall
be a moratorium on the taking, killing or treating of whales, excluding
minke whales, by factory ships or whale catchers attached to factory
ships.

50 gross register tonnage are used for this purpose, and the taking of
gray whales, and of bowhead whales from the Bering Sea stock, by
aborigines or a Contracting Government on behalf of aborigines is
permitted, but only when the meat and products of such whales are to
be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines and further
provided, with respect to the Bering Sea stock of bowhead whales that:

a)     in 1978, hunting shall cease when either 20 have been struck or
14 landed

b)     in 1979, hunting shall cease when either 27 have been struck or

to land stations, provided that, the meat of such whales is to be used
for local consumption as human or animal food.

b)     It is forbidden to take or kill any fin whales below 57 feet
(17.4 metres) in length in the Southern Hemisphere, and it is forbidden
to take or kill fin whales below 55 feet (16.8 metres) in the Northern

metres) may be taken for delivery to land stations in the Southern
Hemisphere and fin whales of not less than 50 feet (15.2 metres) may
be taken for delivery to land stations in the Northern Hemisphere,
provided that, in each case the meat of such whales is to be used for
local consumption as human or animal food.

IV. TREATMENT

19.    a) It is forbidden to use a factory or a land station for the
purpose of treating any whales (whether or not taken by whale catchers
under the jurisdiction of a Contracting Government) which are
classified as Protection Stocks in paragraph 8 or are taken by whale
catchers under the jurisdiction of a Contracting Government in
contravention of paragraphs 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 14 and 15 of this Schedule.

b)     All other whales, except minke whales, taken shall be delivered
to the factory ship or land station and all parts of such whales shall
be processed by boiling or otherwise, except the internal organs, whale
bone and flippers of all whales, the meat of sperm whales and of parts
of whales intended for human food or feeding animals. A Contracting
Government may in less developed regions exceptionally permit treating
of whales without use of land stations, provided that such whales are
fully utilised in accordance with this paragraph.

c)     Complete treatment of the carcasses of "dauhval" and of whales
used as fenders will not be required in cases where the meat or bone
of such whales is in bad condition.

20.    a) The taking of whales for treating by a factory ship shall be
so regulated or restricted by the master or person in charge of the
factory ship that no whale carcase (except of a whale used as a fender,
which shall be processed as soon as is reasonably practicable) shall
remain in the sea for a longer period than thirty-three hours from the
time of killing to the time when it is hauled up for treatment.

b)     Whales taken by all whale catchers, whether for factory ships or
land stations, shall be clearly marked so as to identify the catcher
and to indicate the order of catching.

V. SUPERVISION AND CONTROL

21.    a) There shall be maintained on each factory ship at least two
inspectors of whaling for the purpose of maintaining twenty-four hour
inspection provided that at least one such inspector shall be
maintained on each catcher functioning as a factory ship. These
inspectors shall be appointed and paid by the Government having
jurisdiction over the factory ship, provided that inspectors need not
be appointed to ships which, apart from the shortage of products, are
used during the season solely for freezing or salting the meat and
entrails of whales intended for human food or feeding animals.

b)     Adequate inspection shall be maintained at each land station. The
inspectors serving at each land station shall be appointed and paid by
the Government having jurisdiction over the land station.

c)     There shall be received such observers as the member countries
may arrange to place on factory ships and land stations or groups of
land stations of other member countries. The observers shall be
appointed by the Commission acting through its Secretary and paid by
the Government nominating them.

22.    Gunners and crews of factory ships, land stations, and whale
catchers, shall be engaged on such terms that their remuneration shall
depend to a considerable extent upon such factors as the species, size
and yield of whales taken and not merely upon the number of the whales
taken. No bonus or other remuneration shall be paid to the gunners or
crews of whale catchers in respect of the taking of lactating whales.

23.    Whales must be measured when at rest on deck or platform after
the hauling out wire and grasping device have been released, by means
of a tape-measure made of non-stretching material. The zero end of the
tape-measure shall be attached to a spike or stable device to be
positioned on the deck or platform abreast of one end of the whale.
Alternatively the spike may be stuck into the tail fluke abreast of the
apex of the notch. The tape-measure shall be held taut in a straight
line parallel to the deck and the whale's body, and other than in
exceptional circumstances along the whale's back, and read abreast of
the other end of the whale. The ends of the whale for measurement
purposes shall be the tip of the upper jaw or, in sperm whales, the
most forward part of the head and the apex of the notch between the
tail flukes.

       Measurements shall be logged to the nearest foot or 0.1 metres.
That is to say, any whale between 75 feet 6 inches and 76 feet 6 inches
shall be logged as 76 feet, and any whale between 76 feet 6 inches and
77 feet 6 inches shall be logged as 77 feet. Similarly, any whale
between 10.15 metres and 10.25 metres shall be logged as 10.2 metres,
and any whale between 10.25 metres and 10.35 metres shall be logged as
10.3 metres. The measurement of any whale which falls on an exact half
foot or 0.05 metre shall be logged at the next half foot or 0.05 metre
e.g. 76 feet 6 inches precisely shall be logged as 77 feet and 10.25
metres precisely shall be logged as 10.3 metres.

Vl. INFORMATION REQUIRED

calendar week, of data on the number of Bryde's and minke whales taken
in any waters south of 400 South Latitude by all factory ships or whale
catchers attached thereto under the jurisdiction of each Contracting
Government, provided that when the number of each of these species
taken is deemed by the Bureau of International Whaling Statistics to
have reached 85 per cent of whatever total catch limit is imposed by
the Commission notification shall be given as aforesaid at the end of
each day of data on the number of each of these species taken.

b)     If it appears that the maximum catches of whales permitted by
paragraph 9 may be reached before 7th April of any year, the Bureau of
International Whaling Statistics shall determine on the basis of the
data provided, the date on which the maximum catch of each of these
species shall be deemed to have been reached and shall notify the
master of each factory ship and each Contracting Government of that
