JOINT PROTOCOL RELATING TO THE APPLICATION OF THE VIENNA CONVENTION
AND THE PARIS CONVENTION

Adopted at Vienna on 21 September 1988


      The Contracting Parties

      Having regard to the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for
Nuclear Damage of 21 May 1963;

      Having regard to the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability
in the Field of Nuclear Energy of 29 July 1960 as amended by the
Additional Protocol of 28 January 1964 and by the Protocol of 16
November 1982;

      Considering that the Vienna Convention and the Paris
Convention are similar in substance and that no State is at present
a Party to both Conventions;

      Convinced that adherence to either Convention by Parties to
the other Convention could lead to difficulties resulting from the
simultaneous application of both Conventions to a nuclear incident;
and

      Desirous to establish a link between the Vienna Convention and
the Paris Convention by mutually extending the benefit of the
special regime of civil liability for nuclear damage set forth under
each Convention and to eliminate conflicts arising from the
simultaneous applications of both Conventions to a nuclear incident;
