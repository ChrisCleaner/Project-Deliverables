ARTICLE IV 

1. Each Contracting State shall take measures to ensure the following: 
a) Before licensing any offshore operation which could cause significant 
risks of pollution in the Protocol Area or any adjacent coastal area, the 
Competent State Authority shall call for submission of an assessment of
the potential environmental effects thereof. No such operation shall 
commence until a statement of those effects has been submitted, and no 
license shall be granted until the Competent State Authority is satisfied

Protocol Area or any adjacent coastal area. 
b) In deciding to call for an environmental impact statement, and in 
determining its scope, the Competent State Authority shall have regard to 
the Guidelines issued by the Organization. 
c) Whenever a Competent State Authority has called for and received an 
environmental impact statement, it shall send to the Organization a 
summary of the potential environmental effects referred to in that 
statement. The Organization shall, within four days of its receipt, 
dispatch copies of that summary to all the other Contracting States. The 
Competent State Authority before granting a licence for the proposed 
operation, shall allow all other Contracting States to submit 
representations to it through the Organization within a stated time which 
shall be reasonable taking into account the type of operation and urgency 
of the need for a decision. It shall consider any such representations 
before licensing the said operation. 
Notwithstanding the obligation to send a summary to the Organization, 
the Contracting State shall have the right to withhold information which 
might prejudice its national security. 
Whenever a Contracting State does not call for an assessment of the 
environmental impact of a proposed offshore operation, it shall consider calling 
for a survey of the marine environment and the aquatic life therein to be made 
before the start of the proposed operation. The survey is to be carried out by or 
under the direct supervision of a body independent of the operator and approved 
by the Competent State Authority. 
3. The Guidelines on Environmental Impact Assessment to be issued by the 
Organization shall contain guidance on the type of operation, and the 
circumstances in which it would cause significant risk of pollution in the 
Protocol Area or any adjacent coastal area. 


ARTICLE V 

1. Each Contracting State shall endeavour to ensure that offshore operations within 
its jurisdiction shall not cause unjustifiable interference with lawful navigation, 
fishing or any other activity carried on under a bilateral or multilateral 
agreement or on the basis of international law, and that in siting an installation, 
due regard shall be had to existing pipelines and cables. Regard shall also be had 
to the need for protecting sites of special ecological and cultural interests. 
2. Each Contracting State shall take steps to ensure that, within the area of its 
jurisdiction, operators of offshore installations survey the sea-bed in the vicinity 
of their installations, and remove any debris resulting from their operations 
which might interfere with lawful fishing: 
a) in the case of a pipeline, or other sub-sea apparatus immediately 
following completion of the work of installation; 
b) in the case of production platform, immediately following its removal.; 
c) in any case when the Competent State Authority might reasonably 
require survey and clean-up. 


ARTICLE VI 

Each Contracting State shall take all practicable measures to ensure that every offshore 
installation to be used in that part of the Protocol Area within its jurisdiction is certified 
by a Certifying Authority or its designee that it is safe and fit for the purpose for which 
it is to be used so as to ensure that it will not cause accidental damage to the marine 
environment. 


ARTICLE VII 

Each Contracting State shall take all practicable measures to ensure the following: 
1. Operators shall at all times have available to their offshore installations, in good 
working order, equipment and devices to minimize the risk of accidental 
pollution and to facilitate prompt response to a pollution emergency, in 
accordance with good oilfield or other relevant industry practice. 
2. Any such plant or equipment not included as part of an installation for the 
purposes of Article VI shall be subject to prior examination and approval by or 
on behalf of the Competent State Authority, and to periodic inspection, in 
accordance with good oilfield or other relevant industry practice. 
3. Blow-out preventers and other safety equipment shall be tested periodically by 
the operators or on his behalf, and exercise in their operations carried out 
periodically, in accordance with good oilfield or other relevant industry practice. 
4. Offshore installations above sea level shall carry lights and other warning 
instruments, in accordance with international maritime practice, maintained in 
good working order, and those light and instruments shall also be operated in 
accordance with international maritime practice. 
5. All persons engaged in offshore operations shall have had or be given training in 
accordance with good oilfield practice. Any person employed on an offshore 
installation for the first time shall undergo an induction course, and shall be 
given a manual which includes instruction on emergency procedures. 


ARTICLE VIII 

Each Contracting State shall take all practicable measures to ensure the following: 
1. No operator shall start work on any stage of his offshore operations within 
its jurisdiction until he has: 
a. prepared a Contingency Plan to deal with any event which may occur as 
a result of the operations, and which may cause significant pollution to 
the marine environment; 
b. had that plan approved by the Competent State Authority; 
c. shown to the satisfaction of that State Authority that he has available to 
him sufficient expertise and resources to put that plan fully into 
operation. 
2. No Contingency Plan shall be approved unless it can be co-ordinated with any 
existing national or local Contingency Plans, and any Plans prepared by the 
Centre, and unless the operator can be required to participate in any exercise 
conducted in the implementation of such Contingency Plans. 
3. Any person conducting offshore operations shall make and maintain 
arrangements to ensure that when an event occurs as a result of his operations 
which may cause significant pollution of the marine environment, a full report of 
that event is sent immediately to the State authority designated to receive such 
reports. 
4. The respective roles and powers of the industry and the authorities shall be fully 
understood before an oil spill emergency, and shall be clearly defined in the 
operator's Contingency Plan, and in any national and local Contingency Plans. 


ARTICLE IX 

1. Each Contracting State shall take all practicable measures to ensure, subject to 
paragraph 2 below, the following: 
a) In that part of the Protocol Area which is a 'Special Area", no machinery 
space drainage from an offshore installation shall be discharged into the 
sea unless the oil content thereof does not exceed 15 mg. per litre whilst 
undiluted . Any Contracting state may impose a more restrictive level in 
any area under its jurisdiction. 
b) No other discharge from an offshore installation into the sea within the 
Protocol Area, except one derived from drilling operations, shall have an 
oil content, whilst undiluted, greater than that stipulated for the time 
being by the Organization. The oil content so stipulated shall not be 
greater than 40 mg. per litre as an average in any calendar month, and 
shall not at any time exceed 100 mg. per litre. 
c) Discharge points for oily wastes shall be well below the surface of the 
sea as appropriate. 
d) All necessary precautions shall be taken to minimize losses of oil into the 
sea from oil and gas collected or flared from well testing. 
2. Measures passed in compliance with paragraph 1 of this Article may provide 
that there is no breach of their requirements if, when the oil content of a 
discharge is greater than the permitted concentrations, that excess was due to 
some accident or other cause beyond the control of the operator and his 
employees, and that they took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due 
diligence to avoid such excess. Alternatively, a defence of equivalent effect may 
be provided. 
3. Each Contracting State shall ensure that the operator may be required to conduct 
surveys of environmental conditions in the vicinity of his offshore installation, 
periodically or on such occasions as the Competent State Authority may 
reasonably require. 
The State itself may conduct or have conducted such a survey. If, without 
apparent reason, the result of that survey show a significant difference from the 
results of the operator's most recent survey, without prejudice to any other legal 
action, the State may charge the cost of its own survey to the operator. 
4. Each Contracting State shall pass measures necessary to ensure the following: 
a. Oil-based drilling fluids shall not be used in drilling operations in those 
parts of the Protocol Area within its jurisdiction except with the express 
sanction of the Competent State Authority. Such sanction shall not be 
given unless the Authority is satisfied that the use of such fluid is 
justified because of exceptional circumstances. If such fluid is used, the 
drill cuttings shall be effectively treated to minimize their oil content 
before being appropriately disposed off. Any wash waters shall not be 
discharged at any place from which they may be carried to mix with the 
same drill cuttings. The discharge point for the cuttings shall, as 
appropriate, be well below the surface of the water. 
b) No oil based drilling fluid shall be discharged to any parts of the Protocol 
Area within its jurisdiction. 
c) Water-based drilling muds discharged from offshore operations must not 
contain persistent systemic toxins which may continue to pose an 
environmental threat after the initial drilling fluid discharge. 


ARTICLE X

bottle, crockery, dunnage, lining and packing materials; 
b) Disposal into the sea of food wastes shall be made as far as practicable 
from land, but in any case not less than 12 nautical miles from the nearest 
land. 
c) When the garbage is mixed with other discharges having different 
disposal or discharge requirements the more severe requirements shall 
apply. 
d) Sewage shall not be discharged into the Protocol Area from an 
installation permanently manned by ten or more persons unless: 
i) it has been comminuted and disinfected using a system approved 
by the Competent State Authority and is discharged at a distance 
of more than four nautical miles from the nearest land; or 
ii) it is discharged at a distance of more than twelve nautical miles 
from the nearest land ; or 
iii) it has passed through a treatment plant approved by the 
Competent State Authority; 
and in any case the discharge does not produce visible floating 
solids or discolouration of the surrounding water. 
2. Each Contracting State shall provide at convenient points on its coastline, 
reception facilities for general garbage from manned offshore installations 
operating in the area of its jurisdiction. 


ARTICLE XI 

1. Each Contracting State shall take all appropriate measures to ensure the 
following: 
a) Each operator of an offshore installation shall prepare, and submit for 
approval by the Competent State Authority, a "Chemical Use Plan". 
Application for amendments to the Plan may be submitted subsequently 
and approved. If at any time he wishes to use a chemical outside the 
scope of his approved Plan, and that chemical may escape into the marine 
environment, he shall notify the Competent State Authority, except that 
in case of emergency to prevent the risk of injury to person or extensive 
damage to property, the notification need not be given prior to the use of 
the chemical. 
b) The Competent State Authority has a power to prohibit, limit or regulate 
the use of a chemical or product and to impose conditions on its storage 
and its use, for the purpose of protecting the marine environment. In 
exercising that power, the Authority shall have regard to any Guidelines 
issued by the Organization. 
2. Each Contracting State shall take appropriate measures to ensure that seismic 
operations in the Protocol Area shall take into account the Guidelines issued by 
the Organization. 


ARTICLE XII

3. endeavour to provide for penalties for improper disposal. 


ARTICLE XIII 

1. Each Contracting State shall ensure that the Competent State Authority has the 
power to require the operator of an offshore installation: 
a. in the case of a pipeline - 
i) to flush and remove any residual pollutants from the pipeline, 
and 
ii) to bury the pipeline , or remove part and bury the remaining parts 
thereof, so as to eliminate for the foreseeable future any risk of 
hindrance to navigation or fishing , taking all circumstances into 
account. 
b) in the case of platforms and other sea-bed apparatus and structures, to 
remove the installation in whole or in part to ensure the safety of
navigation and in the interests of fishing. 
Each Contracting State shall also take all practicable measures to ensure that the 
operator has sufficient resources to guarantee that any such requirements can be 
met.
2. Where Contracting States have a common interest in fishing grounds in the 
Protocol Area, they shall endeavour to adopt a common policy on the removal of 
installations. 
In determining any case whether or not installations must be removed, 
Contracting States shall have regard to any Guidelines issued by the 
Organization. Whether pipelines are removed or not, they shall be flushed to 
remove residual pollutants.
