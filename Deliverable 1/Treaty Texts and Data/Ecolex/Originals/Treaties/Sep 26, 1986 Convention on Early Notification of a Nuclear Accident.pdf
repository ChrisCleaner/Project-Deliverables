CONVENTION ON EARLY NOTIFICATION OF A NUCLEAR ACCIDENT 

Adopted at Vienna on 26 September 1986


      The States Parties to this Convention,

      Aware that nuclear activities are being carried out in a
number of States,

      Noting that comprehensive measures have been and are being
taken to ensure a high level of safety in nuclear activities, aimed
at preventing nuclear accidents and minimizing the consequences of
any such accident, should it occur,

      Desiring to strengthen further international co-operation in
the safe development and use of nuclear energy,

      Convinced of the need for States to provide relevant
information about nuclear accidents as early as possible in order
that transboundary radiological consequences can be minimized,

      Noting the usefulness of bilateral and multilateral
arrangements on information exchange in this area,

      Have agreed as follows:


Article 1

occurs or is likely to occur and which has resulted or may result in
an international transboundary release that could be of radiological
safety significance for another State.

2.    The facilities and activities referred to in paragraph 1 are
the following:

(a)   any nuclear reactor wherever located;

(b)   any nuclear fuel cycle facility;

(c)   any radioactive waste management facility;

objects.


Article 2
NOTIFICATION AND INFORMATION

      In the event of an accident specified in article 1
(hereinafter referred to as a "nuclear accident"), the State Party
referred to in that article shall:

(a)   forthwith notify, directly or through the International Atomic
