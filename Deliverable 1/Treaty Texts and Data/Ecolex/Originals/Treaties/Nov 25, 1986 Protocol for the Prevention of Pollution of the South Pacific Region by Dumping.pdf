REGION BY DUMPING

Adopted at Noumea on 25 November 1986


The Parties to the Protocol,

Being Parties to the Convention for the Protection of the 
Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region, 
adopted in Noumea, New Caledonia on the twenty-fourth day of 
November in the year one thousand nine hundred and eighty-six;

Recognizing the danger posed to the marine environment by 
pollution caused by the dumping of waste or other matter;

Considering that they have a common interest to protect the 
South Pacific Region from this danger, taking into account the 
unique environmental quality of the region;

 Desiring to enter into a regional agreement consistent with the 
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of 
Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 as provided in Article VIII thereof 
according to which the Contracting Parties to that Convention 
have undertaken to endeavour to act consistently with the 
objectives and provisions of such regional agreement;

Have agreed as follows:


Article 1
DEFINITIONS

For the purpose of this Protocol "Convention" means the 
Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and 
Environment of the South Pacific Region adopted in Noumea, New 
Caledonia on the twenty-fourth day of November in the year one 
thousand nine hundred and eighty-six.


Article 2 
GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE

The area to which this Protocol applies, hereinafter referred to 
as the "Protocol Area", shall be the Convention Area as defined 
in Article 2 of the Convention together with the continental 
shelf of a Party where it extends, in accordance with 
international law, outward beyond the Convention Area.


Article 3
GENERAL OBLIGATIONS

1. The Parties shall take all appropriate measures to prevent, 
reduce and control pollution in the Protocol Area by dumping.

2. Dumping within the territorial sea and the exclusive economic 
zone or onto the continental shelf of a Party as defined in 
international law shall not be carried out without the express 
prior approval of that Party, which has the right to permit, 
regulate and control such dumping taking fully into account the 
provisions of this Protocol, and after due consideration of the 
matter with other Parties which by reason of their geographical 
situation may be adversely affected thereby.

3. National laws, regulations and measures adopted by the Parties 
shall be no less effective in preventing, reducing and 
controlling pollution by dumping than the relevant 
internationally recognized rules and procedures relating to the 
control of dumping established within the framework of the 
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of 
Wastes and Other Matter, 1972.


Article 4
PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES

1. The dumping in the Protocol Area of wastes or other matter 
listed in Annex I to this Protocol is prohibited except as 
provided in this Protocol.

2. No provision of this Protocol is to be interpreted as 
preventing a Party from prohibiting, insofar as that Party is 
concerned the dumping of wastes or other matter not mentioned in 
Annex I. That Party shall notify such measures to the 
Organisation.


Article 5 
SPECIAL PERMITS

The dumping in the Protocol Area of wastes or other matter 
listed in Annex II to this Protocol requires, in each case, a 
prior special permit.

any Party or Parties likely to be affected, together with full 
details of the circumstances and of the nature and quantities of 
the wastes or other matter dumped.


Article 10
EMERGENCIES

1. A Party may issue a special permit as an exception to Article 
4, in emergencies arising in the Protocol Area, posing 
unacceptable risk relating to human health and admitting no other 
feasible solution. Before doing so the Party shall consult any 
other country or countries that are likely to be affected and the 
Organisation which, after consulting other Parties, and 
international organisations as appropriate, shall in accordance 
with Article 15 promptly recommend to the Party the most 
appropriate procedures to adopt. The Party shall follow these 
recommendations to the maximum extent feasible consistent with 
the time within which action must be taken and with the general 
obligation to avoid damage to the marine environment and shall 
inform the Organisation of the action it takes. The Parties 
pledge themselves to assist one another in such situations.

C.

Containers, scrap metal and other bulky wastes liable to sink to 
the sea bottom which may present a serious obstacle to fishing or 
navigation.

D.

Substances which, though of a non-toxic nature, may become 
harmful due to the quantities in which they are dumped, or which 
are liable to seriously reduce amenities.


Annex III

Provisions to be considered in establishing criteria governing 
the issue of permits for the dumping of matter at sea, taking 
into account Article 7 of this Protocol, include:

A. CHARACTERISTICS AND COMPOSITION OF THE MATTER

1. Total amount and average composition of matter dumped (e.g. 
per year).

2. Form (e.g. solid, sludge, liquid, or gaseous).

3. Properties: physical (e.g. solubility and density), chemical 
and biochemical (e.g. oxygen demand, nutrients) and biological 
(e.g. presence of viruses, bacteria, yeasts, parasites).

4. Toxicity.

5. Persistence: physical, chemical and biological.

6. Accumulation and biotransformation in biological materials or 
sediments.

7. Susceptibility to physical, chemical and biochemical changes 
and interaction in the aquatic environment with other dissolved 
organic and inorganic materials.

8. Probability of production of taints or other changes reducing 
marketability of resources (e.g. fish, shellfish, etc.).

9. In issuing a permit for dumping, Parties should consider 
whether an adequate scientific basis and sufficient knowledge of 
the composition and characteristics of the wastes or other matter 
proposed for dumping exist for assessing the impact of such 
material on the marine environment and human health.

B CHARACTERISTICS OF DUMPING SITE AND METHOD OF DEPOSIT
 
1. Location (e.g. co-ordinates of the dumping area, depth and 
distance from the coast), location in relation to other areas 
(e.g. amenity areas, spawning, nursery and fishing areas and 
exploitable resources).

2. Rate of disposal per specific period (e.g. quantity per day, 
per week, per month).

3 Methods of packaging and containment, if any.

4. Initial dilution achieved by proposed methods of release.

5. Dispersal characteristics (e.g. effects of currents, tides and 
wind on horizontal transport and vertical mixing).

6. Water characteristics (e.g. temperature, pH, salinity, 
stratification, oxygen indices of pollution, dissolved oxygen 
(DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD), nitrogen present in organic and mineral form including 
ammonia, suspended matter, other nutrients and productivity).

7. Bottom characteristics (e.g. topography, geochemical and 
geological characteristics and biological productivity).

8. Existence and effects of other dumpings which have been made 
in the dumping area (e.g. heavy metal background reading and 
organic carbon content).

9. In issuing a permit for dumping, Parties should consider 
whether an adequate scientific basis exists for assessing the 
consequences of such dumping, as outlined in this Annex taking 
into account seasonal variations.

C. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND CONDITIONS

1. Possible effects on amenities (e.g. presence of floating or 
stranded materials, turbidity, objectionable odour, 
discolouration and foaming).

2. Possible effects on marine life, fish and shellfish culture, 
fish stocks and fisheries, seaweed harvesting and culture.

3. Possible effects on other uses of the sea (e.g. impairment of 
water quality for industrial use, underwater corrosion of 
structure, interference with ship operations from floating 
materials, interference with fishing or navigation through 
deposit of waste or solid objects on the sea floor and protection 
of areas of special importance of scientific or conservation 
purposes).

4. The practical availability of alternative land-based methods 
of treatment, disposal or elimination, or of treatment to render 
the matter less harmful for dumping at sea.

D. REFERENCES

Reference should also be made to "Guidelines for the 
Implementation and Uniform Interpretation of Annex III" as 
adopted by the Consultative Meeting of Contracting Parties to the 
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of 
Wastes and Other Matter, 1972.
