<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>WISHING</b> to establish the detailed procedures for the conduct
of tuna long-line fishing operations by fishing vessels of Japan (hereinafter

referred to as "the Zone") and for the issuance of licences by the Government
of Australia,
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>HAVE AGREED</b> as follows:

of the Head Agreement, issue licences for the vessels, the number of which
shall not exceed two hundred and fifty, subject to payment to the Government
of Australia of a fee of three million four hundred thousand Australian
dollars for all the vessels to be licensed and for the period of validity
of this Subsidiary Agreement. This fee consists of the following amounts:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

Coast Area specified in Appendix I to this Subsidiary Agreement, which
forms an integral part hereof;
<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>The Government of Australia shall, by the licences issued for the vessels
referred to in Article I of this Subsidiary Agreement, permit those vessels
to take within the Zone all species of tuna and broadbill swordfish, together
with all other species of finfish including bill-fish and oceanic sharks

in Appendix II to this Subsidiary Agreement, which forms an integral part
hereof; and
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(b) by the use of hand-lines, in the area of the Coral Sea bounded to

it might not be possible for a vessel to prevent parts of its long-line
from drifting into an area of the Zone at the time when that vessel is
not permitted to take fish in that area in accordance with the provisions
of Article II of this Subsidiary Agreement. Cases verified by the Government
of Australia as cases in which the drifting of a part of a long-line into
such an area cannot reasonably be avoided shall not be regarded as infringements
