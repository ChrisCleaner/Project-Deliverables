AGREEMENT ON THE COOPERATION FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEKONG RIVER BASIN


CHAPTER I.
PREAMBLE

Recalling the establishment of the Committee for the Coordination of Investigations of the Lower Mekong Basin on 17 September 1957 by the Governments of these countries by Statute endorsed by the United Nations,

Noting the unique spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance that inspired the work of the Committee for the Coordination of Investigations of the Lower Mekong Basin and the
many accomplishments that have been achieved through its efforts,

Acknowledging the great political, economic and social changes that have taken place in these countries of the region during this period of time which necessitate these efforts to re-assess, re-define and establish the future framework for cooperation,

Recognizing that the Mekong River Basin and the related natural resources and envi-ronment are natural assets of immense value to all the riparian countries for the economic and social well-being and living standards of their peoples,

Reaffirming the determination to continue to cooperate and promote in a constructive and mutually beneficial manner in the sustainable development, utilization, conservation
and management of the Mekong River Basin water and related resources for navigational and non-navigational purposes, for social and economic development and the well-being of all riparian States, consistent with the needs to protect, preserve, enhance and manage the environmental and aquatic conditions and maintenance of the ecological balance exceptional to this river basin,

Affirming to promote or assist in the promotion of interdependent sub-regional growth and cooperation among the community of Mekong nations, taking into account the regional benefits that could be derived and/or detriments that could be avoided or mitigated from activities within the Mekong River Basin undertaken by this framework of cooperation,

Realizing the necessity to provide an adequate, efficient and functional joint organizational structure to implement this Agreement and the projects, programs and activities taken thereunder in cooperation and coordination with each member and the international community, and to address and resolve issues and problems that may arise from the use and development of the Mekong River Basin water and related resources in an amicable, timely and good neighbourly manner,

Proclaiming further the following specific objectives, principles, institutional frame-work and ancillary provisions in conformity with the objectives and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law:

CHAPTER II 
DEFINITIONS OF TERMS

For the purposes of this Agreement, it shall be understood that the following meanings to the underlined terms shall apply except where otherwise inconsistent with the context:
Agreement under Article 5: A decision of the Joint Committee resulting from prior consultation and evaluation on any proposed use for inter-basin diversions during the wet season from the mainstream as well as for intra- basin use or inter-basin diversions of these waters during the dry season. The objective of this agreement is to achieve an optimum use and prevention of waste of the waters through a dynamic and practical consensus in con-formity with the Rules for Water Utilization and Inter-Basin Diversions set forth in Article 26.
Acceptable minimum monthly natural flow: The acceptable minimum monthly natural flow during each month of the dry season. Acceptable natural reverse flow: The wet season flow level in the Mekong River at Kratie that allows the reverse flow of the Tonle Sap to an agreed upon optimum level of the Great Lake.
Basin Development Plan: The general planning tool and process that the Joint Committee would use as a blueprint to identify, categorize and prioritize the projects and pro-grams
to seek assistance for and to implement the plan at the basin level.
Environment: The conditions of water and land resources, air, flora, and fauna that exists in a particular region.
Notification: Timely providing information by a riparian to the Joint Committee on its proposed use of water according to the format, content and procedures set forth in the Rules
for Water Utilization and Inter-Basin Diversions under Article 26.
Prior consultation: Timely notification plus additional data and information to the Joint Committee as provided in the Rules for Water Utilization and Inter-Basin Diversion under Article 26, that would allow the other member riparians to discuss and evaluate the
impact of the proposed use upon their uses of water and any other affects, which is the basis for arriving at an agreement. Prior consultation is neither a right to veto the use nor
unilateral right to use water by any riparian without taking into account other riparians' rights.
Proposed use: Any proposal for a definite use of the waters of the Mekong River system by any riparian, excluding domestic and minor uses of water not having a significant
impact on mainstream flows.

CHAPTER III
