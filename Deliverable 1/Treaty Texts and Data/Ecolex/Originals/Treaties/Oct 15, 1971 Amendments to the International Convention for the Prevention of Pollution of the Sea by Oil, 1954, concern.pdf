AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE PREVENTION 
OF POLLUTION OF THE SEA BY OIL, 1954 CONCERNING TANK 
ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMITATIONS OF TANK SIZE

The Seventh Assembly of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative
Organization adopted on 15 October 1971, by Resolution A.246 (VII), 
the following amendments to the International Convention for
the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954.  In accordance
with Article XVI (4) of the Convention, the amendments will come
into force twelve months after the date on which they are accepted
by two-thirds of the Contracting Governments.


The Assembly,

    Noting Article 16 (i) of the Convention on the 
Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization 
concerning the functions of the Assembly,

    Being conscious of the responsibility of the Organization 
for taking effective measures for the prevention and control 
of pollution of the marine environment which may arise from 
maritime activities,

    Realizing that notwithstanding the adoption by the 
Organization of various measures for preventing collisions and 
strandings of ships, it is not possible to eliminate entirely 
accidents which may lead to release of oil, but desiring to 
minimize ensuing damage to the environment,

    Recognizing that construction of oil tankers of large size 
without accompanying control of size or internal arrangement 
of cargo tanks leads to the possibility, in the event of a 
single accident, of serious environmental pollution,

    Having examined the Recommendations relating to tank 
arrangements and to the limitation of tank size prepared by 
the Maritime Safety Committee at its twenty-third session.

    Considering that the universal implementation of such 
requirements can best be achieved by amending the 
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of 
the Sea by Oil, 1954,

    Noting that Article XVI of the International Convention for 
the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil 1954 provides 
for procedures of amendment involving participation by the 
Organization,


    Adopts the following amendments to the Articles and Annexes 
to that Convention, the texts of which are attached to this 
Resolution:

    a) the addition of a new Article VIbis, and 

    b) the addition of a new Annex C,

    Requests the Secretary-General of the Organization, in 
conformity with sub-paragraph (2) (a) of Article XVI to 
communicate for consideration and acceptance, certified copies 
of this Resolution and its Annexes, to all Contracting 
Governments to the International Convention for the Prevention 
of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954, together with copies to 
all Members of the Organization,

    Invites all governments concerned to accept the amendments at 
the earliest possible date, and

    Determines in accordance with paragraph (5) of Article XVI 
that these amendments are of such an important nature that any 
Contracting Government which makes a declaration under 
paragraph (4) of Article XVI and which does not accept the 
amendments within a period of 12 months after the amendments 
come into force, shall, upon the expiry of this period, cease 
to be a Party to the present Convention.


ANNEX 1

Add new Article VIbis as follows:

Article VIbis

1.   Every tanker to which the present Convention applies and 
for which the building contract is placed on or after the date 
of coming into force of this Article shall be constructed in 
accordance with the provisions of Annex C. In addition, every 
tanker to which the present Convention applies and for which 
the building contract is placed, or in the absence of a 
building contract the keel of which is laid or which is at a 
similar stage of construction, before the date of coming into 
force of this Article shall be required, within two years 
after that date, to comply with the provisions of Annex C, 
where such a tanker falls into either of the following 
categories:

a) a tanker, the delivery of which is after 1 January 1977; or

b) a tanker to which both the following conditions apply:

   (i) delivery is not later than 1 January 1977; and

  (ii) the building contract is placed after 1 January 1972, 
       or in cases where no building contract has previously been 
       placed the keel is laid, or the tanker is at a similar stage 
       of construction, after 30 June 1972.

2. A tanker required under paragraph (1) of this Article to be 
constructed in accordance with Annex C and so constructed 
shall carry on board a certificate issued or authorized by the 
responsible Contracting Government attesting such compliance. 
A tanker which under paragraph (l) of this Article is not 
required to be constructed in accordance with Annex C shall 
carry on board a certificate to that effect issued or 
authorized by the responsible Contracting Government, or if 
the tanker does comply with Annex C although not required to 
do so, it may carry on board a certificate issued or 
authorized by the responsible Contracting Government attesting 
such compliance. A Contracting Government shall not permit 
such tankers under its flag to trade unless the appropriate 
certificate has been issued.

3. Certificates issued under the authority of a Contracting 
Government shall be accepted by the other Contracting 
Governments for all purposes covered by the present 
Convention. They shall be regarded by the other Contracting 
Governments as having the same force as certificates issued by 
them.

4. If a Contracting Government has clear grounds for believing 
that a tanker required under paragraph (1) of this Article to 
be constructed in accordance with Annex C entering ports in 
its territory or using off-shore terminals under its control 
does not in fact comply with Annex C, such Contracting 
Government may request consultation with the Government with 
which the tanker is registered. If, after such consultation or 
otherwise, the Contracting Government is satisfied that the 
tanker does not comply with Annex C, such Contracting 
Government may for this reason deny such a tanker access to 
ports in its territorial waters or to off-shore terminals 
under its control until such time as the Contracting 
Government is satisfied that the tanker does comply.


Add new Annex C as follows:


ANNEX C*

* where these Amendments enter into force, the Annex (Form of 
Oil Record Book) will become Annex A and this Annex will 
become Annex B

REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO TANK ARRANGEMENTS AND TO THE 
LIMITATION OF TANK SIZE 

1. Assumed extent of damage

In the following paragraphs three dimensions of the extent of 
damage of a parallelepiped due to both collision and stranding 
are assumed. In the case of stranding, two conditions are set 
forth to be applied individually to the stated portions of the 
ship. These values represent the maximum assumed damage in 
such accidents and are to be used to determine by trial at all 
conceivable locations the worst combination of compartments 
which would be breached by such an accident.

1.1 Collision

Longitudinal extent (lc)          1/3 x L x 2/3  or  14.5 metres, 
                                                     whichever 
                                                     is less


Transverse extent (tc)                 B/5       or  11.5 metres, 
inboard from the ship's side at                      whichever 
right angles to the centreline                       is less
at the level of the load line


Vertical extent (vc)                                 from the baseline
                                                     upwards without
                                                     limit


1.2 Stranding                    For O.3L from       Any other
                                 the forward         part of
                                 perpendicular       the ship
                                 of the ship

Longitudinal extent (ls)               L/10          5 metres


Transverse extent (ts)           B/6 or 10 metres,   5 metres
                                 whichever is less


Vertical extent (vs)             B/15            or  6 metres,
from the base line                                   whichever is
                                                     less, for any
                                                     part of the ship

where: L, B in metres and perpendicular are as defined in 
       Regulation 3 of the International Convention on Load
       Lines, 1966.


2. Hypothetical oil outflow from tanks assumed to be breached as a
   result of the accident

The hypothetical oil outflow in the case of collision (Oc) and
stranding (Os) shall be calculated by the following formulae with 
respect to compartments breached by each assumed location of damage 
as defined in Section 1.

2.1 Collision

Oc = sigmaWi + sigmaKiCi  ............................(1)

2.2 Stranding

Os = 1/3(sigmaZiWi + sigma ZiCi)  ....................(2)

where:

Wi = volume of a wing tank in cubic metres breached by the damage
     assumed in Section l; Wi for a clean ballast tank may be taken
     equal to zero,

Ci = volume of a centre tank in cubic metres breached by the damage
     assumed in Section l; Ci for a clean ballast tank may be taken
     equal to zero,

Ki = 1- bi/tc;  when bi is equal to or greater than tc, Ki shall be
     taken equal to zero,

Zi = 1- hi/vs; when hi is equal to or greater than vs, Zi shall be
     taken equal to zero,

bi = width of wing tank in metres under consideration.

hi = minimum depth of the bottom in metres under consideration; where
     no double bottom is fitted, shall be taken equal to zero,

wing tank = any tank adjacent to the side shell plating,
centre tank = any tank inboard a longitudinal bulkhead.

2.3 Special requirements

2.3.1 If a void space or clean water ballast tank of a length less than lc 
as defined in 1.1 is located between wing oil tanks, Oc in formula (1) may 
be calculated on the basis of volume Wi being the actual volume of one such 
tank (where they are of equal capacity) or the smaller of the two tanks (if 
they differ in capacity) adjacent to such space, multiplied by Si as 
defined below and taking for all other wing tanks involved in such a 
collision the value of the actual full volume.

Si = 1 - li/lc

where: li = length in metres of void space or clean ballast tank under 
            consideration.

2.3.2 a) Credit shall only be given in respect of double bottom tanks which 
are either empty or carrying clean water when cargo is carried in the tanks 
above.

b) Where the double bottom does not extend for the full length and width of 
the tank involved, the double bottom is considered non-existent and the 
volume of the tanks above the area of the stranding damage shall be 
included in formula (2) even if the tank is not considered breached because 
of the installation of such a partial double bottom.

c) Suction wells may be neglected in the determination of the value hi 
provided such wells are not excessive in area and extend below the tank for 
a minimum distance and in no case more than half the height of the double 
bottom. If the depth of such a well exceeds half the height of the double 
bottom, hi shall be equal to the double bottom height minus the well 
height. Piping serving such wells if installed within the double bottom 
shall be fitted with valves or other closing arrangements located at the 
point of connection to the tank served to prevent oil outflow in the event 
of damage of the piping during stranding. Such piping shall be installed as 
high from the bottom shell as possible.

2.3.3. In the case where stranding damage simultaneously involves four 
centre tanks, the value of Os may be calculated according to the formula

Os = 1/4(sigmaZiWi + sigmaZiCi) ........................(3)

2.3.4 An Administration may credit as reducing oil outflow in case of 
stranding, an installed cargo transfer system having an emergency high 
suction in each cargo oil tank, capable of transferring from a breaching 
tank or tanks to segregated ballast tanks or to available cargo tankage if 
it can be assured that such tanks will have sufficient ullage. Credit for 
such a system would be governed by ability to transfer in two hours of 
operation, oil equal to one half of the largest of the breached tanks 
involved and by availability of equivalent receiving capacity in ballast or 
cargo tanks. The credit shall be confined to permitting calculation of Os 
according to formula (3). The pipes for such suction shall be installed at 
least at a height not less than the vertical extent of the stranding damage 
vs.

The Administration shall supply the Organization with the information 
concerning the arrangements accepted by it, for circulation to other 
governments.

3. Limitations of size of cargo oil tanks

3.1 Limitation of hypothetical oil outflow

The hypothetical oil outflow Oc or Os calculated in accordance with the 
formulae in Section 2 shall not exceed 30,000 cubic metres or 400 square 
root of DW, whichever is the greater but subject to a maximum of 40,000 
cubic metres, where DW = deadweight of the ship in metric tons.

3.2 Limitation of volume of single rank

The volume of a wing tank shall not exceed seventy-five per cent of the 
limits of hypothetical oil outflow referred to in 3.1. The volume of a 
centre tank shall not exceed 50,000 cubic metres. 

3.3 Limitation of tank length

The length of each tank shall not exceed 10 metres or one of the 
following values, whichever is the greater: 

a) where no longitudinal bulkhead is provided: 0. 1L 
b) where a longitudinal bulkhead is provided at the centreline only: 0.15L 
c) where two or more longitudinal bulkheads are provided:

    (i) for wing tanks: 0.2L 

    (ii) for centre tanks: (1) if bi/B is equal to or greater than 1/5: 0.2L
                           (2) if bi/B is less than 1/5:

                               - where no centreline longitudinal
                                 bulkhead is provided: 
                                 (0.5 bi/B + 0.1)L

                               - where a centreline longitudinal
                                 bulkhead is provided: 
                                 (0.25 bi/B + 0.15)L
