(b) The Contracting Governments undertake to promulgate all laws, decrees, orders and regulations and to take all other steps which may be necessary to give the present Convention full and complete effect, so as to ensure that, from the point of view of safety of life, a ship is fit for the service for which it is intended. 


Article II 

Application 
The present Convention shall apply to ships entitled to fly the flag of States the Governments of which are Contracting Governments. 


Article III 

Laws, regulations 
The Contracting Governments undertake to communicate to and deposit with the Secretary-General of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (hereinafter referred to as "the Organization"):

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the present Convention any certificate issued under, and in accordance with, the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960, which is current when the present Convention comes into force in respect of the Administration by which the certificate is issued, shall remain valid until it expires under the terms of Regulation 14 of Chapter I of that Convention. 
(c) A Contracting Government shall not issue certificates under, and in accordance with, the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960, 1948 or 1929, after the date on which acceptance of the present Convention by the Government takes effect. 

Regulation 13 
Issue of certificate by another Government 
A Contracting Government may, at the request of the Administration, cause a ship to be surveyed and, if satisfied that the requirements of the present Regulations are complied with, shall issue certificates to the ship in accordance with the present Regulations. Any certificate so issued must contain a statement to the effect that it has been issued at the request of the Government of the State whose flag the ship is or will be entitled to fly, and it shall have the same force and receive the same recognition as a certificate issued under Regulation 12 of this Chapter.

Acceptance of certificates 
Certificates issued under the authority of a Contracting Government shall be accepted by the other Contracting Governments for all purposes covered by the present Convention. They shall be regarded by the other Contracting Governments as having the same force as certificates issued by them. 

Regulation 18 
Qualification of certificates 
(a) If in the course of a particular voyage a ship has on board a number of persons less than the total number stated in the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate and is in consequence, in accordance with the provisions of the present Regulations, free to carry a small number of lifeboats and other life-saving appliances than that stated in the Certificate, an annex may be issued by the Government, person or organization referred to in Regulation 12 or 13 of this Chapter. 
(b) This annex shall state that in the circumstances there is no infringement of the provisions of the present Regulations. It shall be annexed to the Certificate and shall be substituted for it in so far as the life-saving appliances are concerned. It shall be valid only for the particular voyage for which it is issued. 

Regulation 19 
Control 
Every ship holding a certificate issued under Regulation 12 or Regulation 13 of this Chapter is subject in the ports of the other Contracting Governments to control by officers duly authorized by such Governments in so far as this control is directed towards verifying that there is on board a valid certificate. Such certificate shall be accepted unless there are clear grounds for believing that the condition of the ship or of its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of that certificate. In that case, the officer carrying out the control shall take such steps as will ensure that the ship shall not sail until it can proceed to sea without danger to the passengers or the crew. In the event of this control giving rise to intervention of any kind, the officer carrying out the control shall inform the Consul of the State whose flag the ship is entitled to fly in writing forthwith of all the circumstances in which intervention was deemed to be necessary, and the facts shall be reported to the Organization. 

Regulation 20

The privileges of the present Convention may not be claimed in favour of any ship unless it holds appropriate valid certificates. 

PART C - CASUALTIES 

Regulation 21 
Casualties 
(a) Each Administration undertakes to conduct an investigation of any casualty occurring to any of its ships subject to the provisions of the present Convention when it judges that such an investigation may assist in determining what changes in the present Regulations might be desirable. 
(b) Each Contracting Government undertakes to supply the Organization with pertinent information concerning the findings of such investigations. No reports or recommendations of the Organization based upon such information shall disclose the identity or nationality of the ships concerned or in any manner fix or imply responsibility upon any ship or person.

(c) The Administration may, if it considers that the sheltered nature and conditions of the voyage are such as to render the application of any specific requirements of this Chapter unreasonable or unnecessary, exempt from those requirements individual ships or classes of ships belonging to its country which, in the course of their voyage, do not proceed more than 20 miles from the nearest land. 
(d) In the case of a passenger ship which is permitted under paragraph (c) of Regulation 27 of Chapter III to carry a number of persons on board in excess of the lifeboat capacity provided, it shall comply with the special standards of subdivision set out in paragraph (e) of Regulation 5 of this Chapter, and the associated special provisions regarding permeability in paragraph (d) of Regulation 4 of this Chapter, unless the Administration is satisfied that, having regard to the nature and conditions of the voyage, compliance with the other provisions of the Regulations of this Chapter and Chapter II-2 of the present Convention is sufficient. 
(e) In the case of passenger ships which are employed in special trades for the carriage of large numbers of special trade passengers, such as the pilgrim trade, the Administration, if satisfied that it is impracticable to enforce compliance with the requirements of this Chapter, may exempt such ships, when they belong to its country, from those requirements, provided that they comply fully with the provisions of: 
(i) the Rules annexed to the Special Trade Passenger Ships Agreement, 1971, and 
(ii) the Rules annexed to the Protocol on Space Requirements for Special Trade Passenger Ships, 1973, when it enters into force. 

Regulation 2 
Definitions 
For the purpose of this Chapter, unless expressly provided otherwise: 
(a) (i) A subdivision load line is a water-line used in determining the subdivision of the ship. 
(ii) The deepest subdivision load line is the water-line which corresponds to the greatest draught permitted by the subdivision requirements which are applicable. 
(b) The length of the ship is the length measured between perpendiculars taken at the extremities of the deepest subdivision load line. 
(c) The breadth of the ship is the extreme width from outside of frame to outside of frame at or below the deepest subdivision load line. 
(d) The draught is the vertical distance from the moulded base line amidships to the subdivision load line in question. 
(e) The bulkhead deck is the uppermost deck up to which the transverse watertight bulkheads are carried. 
(f) The margin line is a line drawn at least 76 millimetres (3 inches) below the upper surface of the bulkhead deck at side. 
(g) The permeability of a space is the percentage of that space which can be occupied by water. 
The volume of a space which extends above the margin line shall be measured only to the height of that line. 
(h) The machinery space is to be taken as extending from the moulded base line to the margin line and between the extreme main transverse watertight bulkheads bounding the spaces containing the main and auxiliary propelling machinery, boilers serving the needs of propulsion, and all permanent coal bunkers. 
In the case of unusual arrangements, the Administration may define the limits of the machinery spaces. 
(i) Passenger spaces are those which are provided for the accommodation and use of passengers, excluding baggage, store, provision and mail rooms. 
For the purposes of Regulations 4 and 5 of this Chapter, spaces provided below the margin line for the accommodation and use of the crew shall be regarded as passenger spaces. 
(j) In all cases volumes and areas shall be calculated to moulded lines. 

PART B - SUBDIVISION AND STABILITY
[6] 
(Part B applies to passenger ships only, except that Regulation 19 also applies to cargo ships.) 

Regulation 3 
Floodable length 
(a) The floodable length at any point of the length of a ship shall be determined by a method of calculation which takes into consideration the form, draught and other characteristics of the ship in question. 
(b) In a ship with a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length at a given point is the maximum portion of the length of the ship, having its centre at the point in question, which can be flooded under the definite assumptions set forth in Regulation 4 of this Chapter without the ship being submerged beyond the margin line. 
(c) (i) In the case of a ship not having a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length at any point may be determined to an assumed continuous margin line which at no point is less than 76 millimetres (3 inches) below the top of the deck (at side) to which the bulkheads concerned and the shell are carried watertight. 
(ii) Where a portion of an assumed margin line is appreciably below the deck to which bulkheads are carried, the Administration may permit a limited relaxation in the watertightness of those portions of the bulkheads which are above the margin line and immediately under the higher deck. 

Regulation 4 
Permeability 
(a) The definite assumptions referred to in Regulation 3 of this Chapter relate to the permeabilities of the spaces below the margin line. 
In determining the floodable length, a uniform average permeability shall be used throughout the whole length of each of the following portions of the ship below the margin line: 
(i) the machinery space as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter; 
(ii) the portion forward of the machinery space; and 
(iii) the portion abaft the machinery space. 
(b) (i) The uniform average permeability throughout the machinery space shall be determined from the formula - 

where: 
a = volume of the passenger spaces, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter, which are situated below the margin line within the limits of the machinery space; 
c = volume of between deck spaces below the margin line within the limits of the machinery space which are appropriated to cargo, coal or stores; 
v = whole volume of the machinery space below the margin line. 
(ii) Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that the average permeability as determined by detailed calculation is less than that given by the formula, the detailed calculated value may be used. For the purpose of such calculation, the permeabilities of passenger spaces, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter, shall be taken as 95, that of all cargo, coal and store spaces as 60, and that of double bottom, oil fuel and other tanks at such values as may be approved in each case. 
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this Regulation, the uniform average permeability throughout the portion of the ship before (or abaft) the machinery space shall be determined from the formula - 

where: 
a = volume of the passenger spaces, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter, which are situated below the margin line, before (or abaft) the machinery space, and 
v = whole volume of the portion of the ship below the margin line before (or abaft) the machinery space. 
(d) In the case of a ship which is permitted under paragraph (c) of Regulation 27 of Chapter III to carry a number of persons on board in excess of the lifeboat capacity provided, and is required under paragraph (d) of Regulation 1 of this Chapter to comply with special provisions, the uniform average permeability throughout the portion of the ship before (or abaft) the machinery space shall be determined from the formula - 

where: 
b = the volume of the spaces below the margin line and above the tops of floors, inner bottom, or peak tanks, as the case may be, which are appropriated to and used as cargo spaces, coal or oil fuel bunkers, store-rooms, baggage and mail rooms, chain lockers and fresh water tanks, before (or abaft) the machinery space; and 
v = whole volume of the portion of the ship below the margin line before (or abaft) the machinery space. 
In the case of ships engaged on services where the cargo holds are not generally occupied by any substantial quantities of cargo, no part of the cargo spaces is to be included in calculating "b". 
(e) In the case of unusual arrangements the Administration may allow, or require, a detailed calculation of average permeability for the portions before or abaft the machinery space. For the purpose of such calculation, the permeability of passenger spaces as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter shall be taken as 95, that of spaces containing machinery as 85, that of all cargo, coal and store spaces as 60, and that of double bottom, oil fuel and other tanks at such value as may be approved in each case. 
(f) Where a between deck compartment between two watertight transverse bulkheads contains any passenger or crew space, the whole of that compartment, less any space completely enclosed within permanent steel bulkheads and appropriated to other purposes, shall be regarded as passenger space. Where, however, the passenger or crew space in question is completely enclosed within permanent steel bulkheads, only the space so enclosed need be considered as passenger space. 

Regulation 5 
Permissible length of compartments 
(a) Ships shall be as effectively subdivided as is possible having regard to the nature of the service for which they are intended. The degree of subdivision shall vary with the length of the ship and with the service, in such manner that the highest degree of subdivision corresponds with the ships of greatest length, primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers. 
(b) Factor of subdivision. The maximum permissible length of a compartment having its centre at any point in the ship's length is obtained from the floodable length by multiplying the latter by an appropriate factor called the factor of subdivision. 
The factor of subdivision shall depend on the length of the ship, and for a given length shall vary according to the nature of the service for which the ship is intended. It shall decrease in a regular and continuous manner: 
(i) as the length of the ship increases, and 
(ii) from a factor A, applicable to ships primarily engaged in the carriage of cargo, to a factor B, applicable to ships primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers. 
The variations of the factors A and B shall be expressed by the following formulae (I) and (II) where L is the length of the ship as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter: 
L in metres 
(L = 131 and upwards)..........(I) 
L in feet 
.18 (L = 430 and upwards) 
L in metres 
.18 (L = 79 and upwards)..........(II) 
L in feet 
B = 100 + .18 (L = 260 and upwards) 
L - 138 
(c) Criterion of service. For a ship of given length the appropriate factor of subdivision shall be determined by the Criterion of Service Numeral (hereinafter called the Criterion Numeral) as given by the following formulae (III) and (IV) where: 
Cs = the Criterion Numeral; 
L = length of the ship, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter; 
M = the volume of the machinery space, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter; with the addition thereto of the volume of any permanent oil fuel bunkers which may be situated above the inner bottom and before or abaft the machinery space; 
P = the whole volume of the passenger spaces below the margin line, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter; 
V = the whole volume of the ship below the margin line; P1 = KN where: 
P1 = KN where: 
N = number of passengers for which the ship is to be certified, and 
K has the following values: 
Value of K 
Length in metres and volumes in cubic metres .056L 
Length in feet and volumes in cubic feet .6L 
Where the value of KN is greater than the sum of P and the whole volume of the actual passenger spaces above the margin line, the figure to be taken as P1 is that sum or two-thirds KN, whichever is the greater. 
When P1 is greater than P - 
..........(III) 
and in other cases - 
..........(IV) 
For ships not having a continuous bulkhead deck the volumes are to be taken up to the actual margin lines used in determining the floodable lengths. 
(d) Rules for subdivision of ships other than those covered by paragraph (e) of this Regulation 
(i) The subdivision abaft the forepeak of ships 131 metres (430 feet) in length and upwards having a criterion numeral of 23 or less shall be governed by the factor A given by formula (I); of those having a criterion numeral of 123 or more by the factor B given by formula (II); and of those having a criterion numeral between 23 and 123 by the factor F obtained by linear interpolation between the factors A and B, using the formula: 
..........(V) 
Nevertheless, where the criterion numeral is equal to 45 or more and simultaneously the computed factor of subdivision as given by formula (V) is .65 or less, but more than .50, the subdivision abaft the forepeak shall be governed by the factor .50. 
Where the factor F is less than .40 and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration to be impracticable to comply with the factor F in a machinery compartment of the ship, the subdivision of such compartment may be governed by an increased factor, which, however, shall not exceed .40. 
(ii) The subdivision abaft the forepeak of ships less than 131 metres (430 feet) but not less than 79 metres (260 feet) in length having a criterion numeral equal to S, where - 
(L in metres) = (L in feet) 
shall be governed by the factor unity; of those having a criterion numeral of 123 or more by the factor B given by the formula (II); of those having a criterion numeral between S and 123 by the factor F obtained by linear interpolation between unity and the factor B using the formula: 
(VI) 
(iii) The subdivision abaft the forepeak of ships less than 131 metres (430 feet) but not less than 79 metres (260 feet) in length and having a criterion numeral less than S, and of all ships less than 79 metres (260 feet) in length shall be governed by the factor unity, unless, in either case, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration to be impracticable to comply with this factor in any part of the ship, in which case the Administration may allow such relaxation as may appear to be justified, having regard to all the circumstances. 
(iv) The provisions of sub-paragraph (iii) of this paragraph shall apply also to ships of whatever length, which are to be certified to carry a number of passengers exceeding 12 but not exceeding - 
(in metres) (in feet), or 50, whichever is the less. 
(e) Special standards of subdivision for ships which are permitted under paragraph (c) of Regulation 27 of Chapter III to carry a number of persons on board in excess of the lifeboat capacity provided and are required under paragraph (d) of Regulation 1 of this Chapter to comply with special provisions 
(i) (1) In the case of ships primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers, the subdivision abaft the forepeak shall be governed by a factor of .50 or by the factor determined according to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Regulation, if less than .50. 
(2) In the case of such ships less than 91.5 metres (300 feet) in length, if the Administration is satisfied that compliance with such factor would be impracticable in a compartment, it may allow the length of that compartment to be governed by a higher factor provided the factor used is the lowest that is practicable and reasonable in the circumstances. 
(ii) Where, in the case of any ship whether less than 91.5 metres (300 feet) or not, the necessity of carrying appreciable quantities of cargo makes it impracticable to require the subdivision abaft the forepeak to be governed by a factor not exceeding .50, the standard of subdivision to be applied shall be determined in accordance with the following sub-paragraphs (1) to (5), subject to the condition that where the Administration is satisfied that insistence on strict compliance in any respect would be unreasonable, it may allow such alternative arrangement of the watertight bulkheads as appears to be justified on merits and will not diminish the general effectiveness of the subdivision. 
(1) The provisions of paragraph (c) of this Regulation relating to the criterion numeral shall apply with the exception that in calculating the value of P1 for berthed passengers K is to have the value defined in paragraph (c) of this Regulation, or 3.55 cubic metres (125 cubic feet), whichever is the greater, and for unberthed passengers K is to have the value 3.55 cubic metres (125 cubic feet). 
(2) The factor B in paragraph (b) of this Regulation shall be replaced by the factor BB determined by the following formula: 
L in metres 
(L = 55 and upwards) 
L in feet 
(L = 180 and upwards) 
(3) The subdivision abaft the forepeak of ships 131 metres (430 feet) in length and upwards having a criterion numeral of 23 or less shall be governed by the factor A given by formula (I) in paragraph (b) of this Regulation; of those having a criterion numeral of 123 or more by the factor BB given by the formula in sub-paragraph (ii)(2) of this paragraph; and of those having a criterion numeral between 23 and 123 by the factor F obtained by linear interpolation between the factors A and BB, using the formula: 

except that if the factor F so obtained is less than .50 the factor to be used shall be either .50 or the factor calculated according to the provisions of sub-paragraph (d)(i) of this Regulation, whichever is the smaller. 
(4) The subdivision abaft the forepeak of ships less than 131 metres (430 feet) but not less than 55 metres (180 feet) in length having a criterion numeral equal to S1 where - 
(L in metres) 
(L in feet) 
shall be governed by the factor unity; of those having a criterion numeral of 123 or more by the factor BB given by the formula in sub-paragraph (ii)(2) of this paragraph; of those having a criterion numeral between S1 and 123 by the factor F obtained by linear interpolation between unity and the factor BB using the formula: 

except that in either of the two latter cases if the factor so obtained is less than .50 the subdivision may be governed by a factor not exceeding .50. 
(5) The subdivision abaft the forepeak of ships less than 131 metres (430 feet) but not less than 55 metres (180 feet) in length and having a criterion numeral less than S1 and of all ships less than 55 metres (180 feet) in length shall be governed by the factor unity, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration to be impracticable to comply with this factor in particular compartments, in which event the Administration may allow such relaxations in respect of those compartments as appear to be justified, having regard to all the circumstances, provided that the aftermost compartment and as many as possible of the forward compartments (between the forepeak and the after end of the machinery space) shall be kept within the floodable length. 

Regulation 6 
Special rules concerning subdivision 
(a) Where in a portion or portions of a ship the watertight bulkheads are carried to a higher deck than in the remainder of the ship and it is desired to take advantage of this higher extension of the bulkheads in calculating the floodable length, separate margin lines may be used for each such portion of the ship provided that: 
(i) the sides of the ship are extended throughout the ship's length to the deck corresponding to the upper margin line and all openings in the shell plating below this deck throughout the length of the ship are treated as being below a margin line, for the purposes of Regulation 14 of this Chapter; and 
(ii) the two compartments adjacent to the "step" in the bulkhead deck are each within the permissible length corresponding to their respective margin lines, and, in addition, their combined length does not exceed twice the permissible length based on the lower margin line. 
(b) (i) A compartment may exceed the permissible length determined by the rules of Regulation 5 of this Chapter provided the combined length of each pair of adjacent compartments to which the compartment in question is common does not exceed either the floodable length or twice the permissible length, whichever is the less. 
(ii) If one of the two adjacent compartments is situated inside the machinery space, and the second is situated outside the machinery space, and the average permeability of the portion of the ship in which the second is situated differs from that of the machinery space, the combined length of the two compartments shall be adjusted to the mean average permeability of the two portions of the ship in which the compartments are situated. 
(iii) Where the two adjacent compartments have different factors of subdivision, the combined length of the two compartments shall be determined proportionately. 
(c) In ships 100 metres (330 feet) in length and upwards, one of the main transverse bulkheads abaft the forepeak shall be fitted at a distance from forward perpendicular which is not greater than the permissible length. 
(d) A main transverse bulkhead may be recessed provided that all parts of the recess lie inboard of vertical surfaces on both sides of the ship, situated at a distance from the shell plating equal to one-fifth the breadth of the ship, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter, and measured at right angles to the centre line at the level of the deepest subdivision load line. 
Any part of a recess which lies outside these limits shall be dealt with as a step in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Regulation. 
(e) A main transverse bulkhead may be stepped provided that it meets one of the following conditions: 
(i) the combined length of the two compartments, separated by the bulkhead in question, does not exceed either 90 per cent of the floodable length or twice the permissible length, except than in ships having a factor of subdivision greater than .9, the combined length of the two compartments in question shall not exceed the permissible length; 
(ii) additional subdivision is provided in way of the step to maintain the same measure of safety as that secured by a plane bulkhead; 
(iii) the compartment over which the step extends does not exceed the permissible length corresponding to a margin line taken 76 millimetres (3 inches) below the step. 
(f) Where a main transverse bulkhead is recessed or stepped, an equivalent plane bulkhead shall be used in determining the subdivision. 
(g) If the distance between two adjacent main transverse bulkheads, or their equivalent plane bulkheads, or the distance between the transverse planes passing through the nearest stepped portions of the bulkheads, is less than 3.05 metres (10 feet) plus 3 per cent of the length of the ship, or 10.67 metres (35 feet) whichever is the less, only one of these bulkheads shall be regarded as forming part of the subdivision of the ship in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 5 of this Chapter. 
(h) Where a main transverse watertight compartment contains local subdivision and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that, after any assumed side damage extending over a length of 3.05 metres (10 feet) plus 3 per cent of the length of the ship, or 10.67 metres (35 feet) whichever is the less, the whole volume of the main compartment will not be flooded, a proportionate allowance may be made in the permissible length otherwise required for such compartment. In such a case the volume of effective buoyancy assumed on the undamaged side shall not be greater than that assumed on the damaged side. 
(i) Where the required factor of subdivision is .50 or less, the combined length of any two adjacent compartments shall not exceed the floodable length. 

Regulation 7 
Stability of ships in damaged condition 
(a) Sufficient intact stability shall be provided in all service conditions so as to enable the ship to withstand the final stage of flooding of any one main compartment which is required to be within the floodable length. 
Where two adjacent main compartments are separated by a bulkhead which is stepped under the conditions of sub-paragraph (e)(i) of Regulation 6 of this Chapter the intact stability shall be adequate to withstand the flooding of those two adjacent main compartments. 
Where the required factor of subdivision is .50 or less but more than .33 intact stability shall be adequate to withstand the flooding of any two adjacent main compartments. 
Where the required factor of subdivision is .33 or less the intact stability shall be adequate to withstand the flooding of any three adjacent main compartments. 
(b) (i) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this Regulation shall be determined by calculations which are in accordance with paragraphs (c), (d) and (f) of this Regulation and which take into consideration the proportions and design characteristics of the ship and the arrangement and configuration of the damaged compartments. In making these calculations the ship is to be assumed in the worst anticipated service condition as regards stability. 
(ii) Where it is proposed to fit decks, inner skins or longitudinal bulkheads of sufficient tightness to seriously restrict the flow of water, the Administration shall be satisfied that proper consideration is given to such restrictions in the calculations. 
(iii) In cases where the Administration considers the range of stability in the damaged condition to be doubtful, it may require investigation thereof. 
(c) For the purpose of making damage stability calculations the volume and surface permeabilities shall be in general as follows: 
Spaces 
Permeability 





Appropriated to cargo, coal or stores 

60 

Occupied by accommodation 

95 

Occupied by machinery 

85 

Intended for liquids 

0 or 95[7] 
Higher surface permeabilities are to be assumed in respect of spaces which, in the vicinity of the damage waterplane, contain no substantial quantity of accommodation or machinery and spaces which are not generally occupied by any substantial quantity of cargo or stores. 
(d) Assumed extent of damage shall be as follows: 
(i) longitudinal extent: 3.05 metres (10 feet) plus 3 per cent of the length of the ship, or 10.67 metres (35 feet) whichever is the less. Where the required factor of subdivision is .33 or less the assumed longitudinal extent of damage shall be increased as necessary so as to include any two consecutive main transverse watertight bulkheads; 
(ii) transverse extent (measured inboard from the ship's side, at right angles to the centre line at the level of the deepest subdivision load line): a distance of one-fifth of the breadth of the ship, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter; and 
(iii) vertical extent: from the base line upwards without limit. 
(iv) If any damage of lesser extent than that indicated in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph would result in a more severe condition regarding heel or loss of metacentric height, such damage shall be assumed in the calculations. 
(e) Unsymmetrical flooding is to be kept to a minimum consistent with efficient arrangements. Where it is necessary to correct large angles of heel, the means adopted shall, where practicable, be self-acting, but in any case where controls to cross-flooding fittings are provided they shall be operable from above the bulkhead deck. These fittings together with their controls as well as the maximum heel before equalization shall be acceptable to the Administration. Where cross-flooding fittings are required the time for equalization shall not exceed 15 minutes. Suitable information concerning the use of cross-flooding fittings shall be supplied to the master of the ship.[8] 
(f) The final conditions of the ship after damage and, in the case of unsymmetrical flooding, after equalization measures have been taken shall be as follows: 
(i) in the case of symmetrical flooding there shall be a positive residual metacentric height of at least 50 millimetres (2 inches) as calculated by the constant displacement method; 
(ii) in the case of unsymmetrical flooding the total heel shall not exceed seven degrees, except that, in special cases, the Administration may allow additional heel due to the unsymmetrical moment, but in no case shall the final heel exceed fifteen degrees; 
(iii) in no case shall the margin line be submerged in the final stage of flooding. If it is considered that the margin line may become submerged during an intermediate stage of flooding, the Administration may require such investigations and arrangements as it considers necessary for the safety of the ship. 
(g) The master of the ship shall be supplied with the data necessary to maintain sufficient intact stability under service conditions to enable the ship to withstand the critical damage. In the case of ships requiring cross-flooding the master of the ship shall be informed of the conditions of stability on which the calculations of heel are based and be warned that excessive heeling might result should the ship sustain damage when in a less favourable condition. 
(h) (i) No relaxation from the requirements for damage stability may be considered by the Administration unless it is shown that the intact metacentric height in any service condition necessary to meet these requirements is excessive for the service intended. 
(ii) Relaxations from the requirements for damage stability shall be permitted only in exceptional cases and subject to the condition that the Administration is to be satisfied that the proportions, arrangements and other characteristics of the ship are the most favourable to stability after damage which can practically and reasonably be adopted in the particular circumstances. 

Regulation 8 
Ballasting 
When ballasting with water is necessary, the water ballast should not in general be carried in tanks intended for oil fuel. In ships in which it is not practicable to avoid putting water in oil fuel tanks, oily-water separator equipment to the satisfaction of the Administration shall be fitted, or other alternative means acceptable to the Administration shall be provided for disposing of the oily-water ballast. 

Regulation 9 
Peak and machinery space bulkheads, shaft tunnels, etc. 
(a) (i) A ship shall have a forepeak or collision bulkhead, which shall be watertight up to the bulkhead deck. This bulkhead shall be fitted not less than 5 per cent of the length of the ship, and not more than 3.05 metres (10 feet) plus 5 per cent of the length of the ship from the forward perpendicular. 
(ii) If the ship has a long forward superstructure, the forepeak bulkhead shall be extended weathertight to the deck next above the bulkhead deck. The extension need not be fitted directly over the bulkhead below, provided it is at least 5 per cent of the length of the ship from the forward perpendicular, and the part of the bulkhead deck which forms the step is made effectively weathertight. 
(b) An afterpeak bulkhead, and bulkheads dividing the machinery space, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter, from the cargo and passenger spaces forward and aft, shall also be fitted and made watertight up to the bulkhead deck. The afterpeak bulkhead may, however, be stepped below the bulkhead deck, provided the degree of safety of the ship as regards subdivision is not thereby diminished. 
(c) In all cases stem tubes shall be enclosed in watertight spaces of moderate volume. The stern gland shall be situated in a watertight shaft tunnel or other watertight space separate from the stern tube compartment and of such volume that, if flooded by leakage through the stem gland, the margin line will not be submerged. 

Regulation 10 
Double bottoms 
(a) A double bottom shall be fitted extending from the forepeak bulkhead to the after peak bulkhead as far as this is practicable and compatible with the design and proper working of the ship. 
(i) In ships 50 metres (165 feet) and under 61 metres (200 feet) in length a double bottom shall be fitted at least from the machinery space to the forepeak bulkhead, or as near thereto as practicable. 
(ii) In ships 61 metres (200 feet) and under 76 metres (249 feet) in length a double bottom shall be fitted at least outside the machinery space, and shall extend to the fore and after peak bulkheads, or as near thereto as practicable. 
(iii) In ships 76 metres (249 feet) in length and upwards, a double bottom shall be fitted amidships, and shall extend to the fore and after peak bulkheads, or as near thereto as practicable. 
(b) Where a double bottom is required to be fitted its depth shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration and the inner bottom shall be continued out to the ship's sides in such a manner as to protect the bottom to the turn of the bilge. Such protection will be deemed satisfactory if the line of intersection of the outer edge of the margin plate with the bilge plating is not lower at any part than a horizontal plane passing through the point of intersection with the frame line amidships of a transverse diagonal line inclined at 25 degrees to the base line and cutting it at a point one-half the ship's moulded breadth from the middle line. 
(c) Small wells constructed in the double bottom in connexion with drainage arrangements of holds, etc., shall not extend downwards more than necessary. The depth of the well shall in no case be more than the depth less 457 millimetres (18 inches) of the double bottom at the centreline, nor shall the well extend below the horizontal plane referred to in paragraph (b) of this Regulation. A well extending to the outer bottom is, however, permitted at the after end of the shaft tunnel of screw-ships. Other wells (e.g., for lubricating oil under main engines) may be permitted by the Administration if satisfied that the arrangements give protection equivalent to that afforded by a double bottom complying with this Regulation. 
(d) A double bottom need not be fitted in way of watertight compartments of moderate size used exclusively for the carriage of liquids, provided the safety of the ship, in the event of bottom or side damage, is not, in the opinion of the Administration, thereby impaired. 
(e) In the case of ships to which the provisions of paragraph (d) of Regulation 1 of this Chapter apply and which are engaged on regular service within the limits of a short international voyage as defined in Regulation 2 of Chapter III, the Administration may permit a double bottom to be dispensed with in any part of the ship which is subdivided by a factor not exceeding .50, if satisfied that the fitting of a double bottom in that part would not be compatible with the design and proper working of the ship. 

Regulation 11 
Assigning, marking and recording of subdivision load lines 
(a) In order that the required degree of subdivision shall be maintained, a load line corresponding to the approved subdivision draught shall be assigned and marked on the ship's sides. A ship having spaces which are specially adapted for the accommodation of passengers and the carriage of cargo alternatively may, if the owners desire, have one or more additional load lines assigned and marked to correspond with the subdivision draughts which the Administration may approve for the alternative service conditions. 
(b) The subdivision load lines assigned and marked shall be recorded in the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate, and shall be distinguished by the notation C.1 for the principal passenger condition, and C.2, C.3, etc., for the alternative conditions. 
(c) The freeboard corresponding to each of these load lines shall be measured at the same position and from the same deck line as the freeboards determined in accordance with the International Convention respecting Load Lines in force. 
(d) The freeboard corresponding to each approved subdivision load line and the conditions of service for which it is approved, shall be clearly indicated on the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate. 
(e) In no case shall any subdivision load line mark be placed above the deepest load line in salt water as determined by the strength of the ship and/or the International Convention respecting Load Lines in force. 
(f) Whatever may be the position of the subdivision load line marks, a ship shall in no case be loaded so as to submerge the load line mark appropriate to the season and locality as determined in accordance with the International Convention respecting Load Lines in force. 
(g) A ship shall in no case be so loaded that when she is in salt water the subdivision load line mark appropriate to the particular voyage and condition of service is submerged. 

Regulation 12 
Construction and initial testing of watertight bulkheads, etc. 
(a) Each watertight subdivision bulkhead, whether transverse or longitudinal, shall be constructed in such a manner that it shall be capable of supporting, with a proper margin of resistance, the pressure due to the maximum head of water which it might have to sustain in the event of damage to the ship but at least the pressure due to a head of water up to the margin line. The construction of these bulkheads shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration. 
(b) (i) Steps and recesses in bulkheads shall be watertight and as strong as the bulkhead at the place where each occurs. 
(ii) Where frames or beams pass through a watertight deck or bulkhead, such deck or bulkhead shall be made structurally watertight without the use of wood or cement. 
(c) Testing main compartments by filling them with water is not compulsory. When testing by filling with water is not carried out, a hose test is compulsory; this test shall be carried out in the most advanced stage of the fitting out of the ship. In any case, a thorough inspection of the watertight bulkheads shall be carried out. 
(d) The forepeak, double bottoms (including duct keels) and inner skins shall be tested with water to a head corresponding to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this Regulation. 
(e) Tanks which are intended to hold liquids, and which form part of the subdivision of the ship, shall be tested for tightness with water to a head up to the deepest subdivision load line or to a head corresponding to two-thirds of the depth from the top of keel to the margin line in way of the tanks, whichever is the greater; provided that in no case shall the test head be less than 0.92 metres (3 feet) above the top of the tank. 
(f) The tests referred to in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this Regulation are for the purpose of ensuring that the subdivision structural arrangements are watertight and are not to be regarded as a test of the fitness of any compartment for the storage of oil fuel or for other special purposes for which a test of a superior character may be required depending on the height to which the liquid has access in the tank or its connexions. 

Regulation 13 
Openings in watertight bulkheads 
(a) The number of openings in watertight bulkheads shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship; satisfactory means shall be provided for closing these openings. 
(b) (i) Where pipes, scuppers, electric cables, etc. are carried through watertight subdivision bulkheads, arrangements shall be made to ensure the integrity of the watertightness of the bulkheads. 
(ii) Valves and cocks not forming part of a piping system shall not be permitted in watertight subdivision bulkheads. 
(iii) Lead or other heat sensitive materials shall not be used in systems which penetrate watertight subdivision bulkheads, where deterioration of such systems in the event of fire would impair the watertight integrity of the bulkheads. 
(c) (i) No doors, manholes, or access openings are permitted: 
(1) in the collision bulkhead below the margin line; 
(2) in watertight transverse bulkheads dividing a cargo space from an adjoining cargo space or from a permanent or reserve bunker, except as provided in paragraph (1) of this Regulation. 
(ii) Except as provided in sub-paragraph (iii) of this paragraph, the collision bulkhead may be pierced below the margin line by not more than one pipe for dealing with fluid in the forepeak tank, provided that the pipe is fitted with a screwdown valve capable of being operated from above the bulkhead deck, the valve chest being secured inside the forepeak to the collision bulkhead. 
(iii) If the forepeak is divided to hold two different kinds of liquids the Administration may allow the collision bulkhead to be pierced below the margin line by two pipes, each of which is fitted as required by sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph, provided the Administration is satisfied that there is no practical alternative to the fitting of such a second pipe and that, having regard to the additional subdivision provided in the forepeak, the safety of the ship is maintained. 
(d) (i) Watertight doors fitted in bulkheads between permanent and reserve bunkers shall be always accessible, except as provided in sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (k) of this Regulation for between deck bunker doors. 
(ii) Satisfactory arrangements shall be made by means of screens or otherwise to prevent the coal from interfering with the closing of watertight bunker doors. 
(e) Within spaces containing the main and auxiliary propelling machinery including boilers serving the needs of propulsion and all permanent bunkers, not more than one door apart from the doors to bunkers and shaft tunnels may be fitted in each main transverse bulkhead. Where two or more shafts are fitted the tunnels shall be connected by an inter-communicating passage. There shall be only one door between the machinery space and the tunnel spaces where two shafts are fitted and only two doors where there are more than two shafts. All these doors shall be of the sliding type and shall be located so as to have their sills as high as practicable. The hand gear for operating these doors from above the bulkhead deck shall be situated outside the spaces containing the machinery if this is consistent with a satisfactory arrangement of the necessary gearing. 
(f) (i) Watertight doors shall be sliding doors or hinged doors or doors of an equivalent type. Plate doors secured only by bolts and doors required to be closed by dropping or by the action of a dropping weight are not permitted. 
(ii) Sliding doors may be either: 
hand-operated only, or 
power-operated as well as hand-operated. 
(iii) Authorized watertight doors may therefore be divided into three Classes: 
Class 1 - hinged doors; 
Class 2 - hand-operated sliding doors; 
Class 3 - sliding doors which are power-operated as well as hand-operated. 
(iv) The means of operation of any watertight door whether power-operated or not shall be capable of closing the door with the ship listed to 15 degrees either way. 
(v) In all classes of watertight doors indicators shall be fitted which show, at all operating stations from which the doors are not visible, whether the doors are open or closed. If any of the watertight doors, of whatever Class, is not fitted so as to enable it to be closed from a central control station, it shall be provided with a mechanical, electrical, telephonic, or any other suitable direct means of communication, enabling the officer of the watch promptly to contact the person who is responsible for closing the door in question, under previous orders. 
(g) Hinged doors (Class 1) shall be fitted with quick action closing devices, such as catches, workable from each side of the bulkhead. 
(h) Hand-operated sliding doors (Class 2) may have a horizontal or vertical motion. It shall be possible to operate the mechanism at the door itself from either side, and in addition, from an accessible position above the bulkhead deck, with an all round crank motion, or some other movement providing the same guarantee of safety and of an approved type. Departures from the requirement of operation on both sides may be allowed, if this requirement is impossible owing to the layout of the spaces. When operating a hand gear the time necessary for the complete closure of the door with the vessel upright, shall not exceed 90 seconds. 
(i) (i) Power-operated sliding doors (Class 3) may have a vertical or horizontal motion. If a door is required to be power-operated from a central control, the gearing shall be so arranged that the door can be operated by power also at the door itself from both sides. The arrangement shall be such that the door will close automatically if opened by local control after being closed from the central control, and also such that any door can be kept closed by local systems which will prevent the door from being opened from the upper control. Local control handles in connexion with the power gear shall be provided each side of the bulkhead and shall be so arranged as to enable persons passing through the doorway to hold both handles in the open position without being able to set the closing mechanism in operation accidentally. Power-operated sliding doors shall be provided with hand gear workable at the door itself on either side and from an accessible position above the bulkhead deck, with an all round crank motion or some other movement providing the same guarantee of safety and of an approved type. Provision shall be made to give warnings by sound signal that the door has begun to close and will continue to move until it is completely closed. The door shall take a sufficient time to close to ensure safety. 
(ii) There shall be at least two independent power sources capable of opening and closing all the doors under control, each of them capable of operating all the doors simultaneously. The two power sources shall be controlled from the central station on the bridge provided with all the necessary indicators for checking that each of the two power sources is capable of giving the required service satisfactorily. 
(iii) In the case of hydraulic operation, each power source shall consist of a pump capable of closing all doors in not more than 60 seconds. In addition, there shall be for the whole installation hydraulic accumulators of sufficient capacity to operate all the doors at least three times, i.e., closed-open- closed. The fluid used shall be one which does not freeze at any of the temperatures liable to be encountered by the ship during its service. 
(j) (i) Hinged watertight doors (Class 1) in passenger, crew and working spaces are only permitted above a deck the underside of which, at its lowest point at side, is at least 2.13 metres (7 feet) above the deepest subdivision load line. 
(ii) Watertight doors, the sills of which are above the deepest load line and below the line specified in the preceding sub-paragraph shall be sliding doors and may be hand-operated (Class 2), except in vessels engaged on short international voyages and required to have a factor of subdivision of .50 or less in which all such doors shall be power-operated. When trunkways in connexion with refrigerated cargo and ventilation or forced draught ducts are carried through more than one main watertight subdivision bulkhead, the doors at such openings shall be operated by power. 
(k) (i) Watertight doors which may sometimes be opened at sea, and the sills of which are below the deepest subdivision load line shall be sliding doors. The following rules shall apply: 
(1) when the number of such doors (excluding doors at entrances to shaft tunnels) exceeds five, all of these doors and those at the entrance to shaft tunnels or ventilation or forced draught ducts, shall be power-operated (Class 3) and shall be capable of being simultaneously closed from a central station situated on the bridge; 
(2) when the number of such doors (excluding doors at entrances to shaft tunnels) is greater than one, but does not exceed five, 
(a) where the ship has no passenger spaces below the bulkhead deck, all the above-mentioned doors may be hand-operated (Class 2); 
(b) where the ship has passenger spaces below the bulkhead deck all the above-mentioned doors shall be power-operated (Class 3) and shall be capable of being simultaneously closed from a central station situated on the bridge; 
(3) in any ship where there are only two such watertight doors and they are into or within the space containing machinery, the Administration may allow these two doors to be hand-operated only (Class 2). 
(ii) If sliding watertight doors which have sometimes to be open at sea for the purpose of trimming coal are fitted between bunkers in the between decks below the bulkhead deck, these doors shall be operated by power. The opening and closing of these doors shall be recorded in such log book as may be prescribed by the Administration. 
(l) (i) If the Administration is satisfied that such doors are essential, watertight doors of satisfactory construction may be fitted in watertight bulkheads dividing cargo between deck spaces. Such doors may be hinged, rolling or sliding doors but shall not be remotely controlled. They shall be fitted at the highest level and as far from the shell plating as practicable, but in no case shall the outboard vertical edges be situated at a distance from the shell plating which is less than one-fifth of the breadth of the ship, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter, such distance being measured at right angles to the centre line of the ship at the level of the deepest subdivision load line. 
(ii) Such doors shall be closed before the voyage commences and shall be kept closed during navigation; and the time of opening such doors in port and of closing them before the ship leaves port shall be entered in the log book. Should any of the doors be accessible during the voyage, they shall be fitted with a device which prevents unauthorized opening. When it is proposed to fit such doors, the number and arrangements shall receive the special consideration of the Administration. 
(m) Portable plates on bulkheads shall not be permitted except in machinery spaces. Such plates shall always be in place before the ship leaves port, and shall not be removed during navigation except in case of urgent necessity. The necessary precautions shall be taken in replacing them to ensure that the joints shall be watertight. 
(n) All watertight doors shall be kept closed during navigation except when necessarily opened for the working of the ship, and shall always be ready to be immediately closed. 
(o) (i) Where trunkways or tunnels for access from crew accommodation to the stokehold, for piping, or for any other purpose are carried through main transverse watertight bulkheads, they shall be watertight and in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 16 of this Chapter. The access to at least one end of each such tunnel or trunkway, if used as a passage at sea, shall be through a trunk extending watertight to a height sufficient to permit access above the margin line. The access to the other end of the trunkway or tunnel may be through a watertight door of the type required by its location in the ship. Such trunkways or tunnels shall not extend through the first subdivision bulkhead abaft the collision bulkhead. 
(ii) Where it is proposed to fit tunnels or trunkways for forced draught, piercing main transverse watertight bulkheads, these shall receive the special consideration of the Administration. 

Regulation 14 
Openings in the shell plating below the margin line 
(a) The number of openings in the shell plating shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship. 
(b) The arrangement and efficiency of the means for closing any opening in the shell plating shall be consistent with its intended purpose and the position in which it is fitted and generally to the satisfaction of the Administration. 
(c) (i) If in a between decks, the sills of any sidescuttles are below a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point 21/2 per cent of the breadth of the ship above the deepest sub-division load line, all sidescuttles in that between deck shall be of the non-opening type. 
(ii) All sidescuttles the sills of which are below the margin line, other than those required to be of a non-opening type by sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph, shall be of such construction as will effectively prevent any person opening them without the consent of the master of the ship. 
(iii) (1) Where in a between decks, the sills of any of the sidescuttles referred to in sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph are below a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point 1.37 metres (41/2 feet) plus 21/2 per cent of the breadth of the ship above the water when the ship departs from any port, all the sidescuttles in that between decks shall be closed watertight and locked before the ship leaves port, and they shall not be opened before the ship arrives at the next port. In the application of this sub-paragraph the appropriate allowance for fresh water may be made when applicable. 
(2) The time of opening such sidescuttles in port and of closing and locking them before the ship leaves port shall be entered in such log book as may be prescribed by the Administration. 
(3) For any ship that has one or more sidescuttles so placed that the requirements of clause (1) of this sub-paragraph would apply when she was floating at her deepest subdivision load line, the Administration may indicate the limiting mean draught at which these sidescuttles will have their sills above the line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side, and having its lowest point 1.37 metres (41/2 feet) plus 21/2 per cent of the breadth of the ship above the water-line corresponding to the limiting mean draught, and at which it will therefore be permissible to depart from port without previously closing and locking them and to open them at sea on the responsibility of the master during the voyage to the next port. In tropical zones as defined in the International Convention respecting Load Lines in force, this limiting draught may be increased by 0.305 metres (1 foot). 
(d) Efficient hinged inside deadlights arranged so that they can be easily and effectively closed and secured watertight shall be fitted to all sidescuttles except that abaft one-eighth of the ship's length from the forward perpendicular and above a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point at a height of 3.66 metres (12 feet) plus 21/2 per cent of the breadth of the ship above the deepest subdivision load line, the deadlights may be portable in passenger accommodation other than that for steerage passengers, unless the deadlights are required by the International Convention respecting Load Lines in force to be permanently attached in their proper positions. Such portable deadlights shall be stowed adjacent to the sidescuttles they serve. 
(e) Sidescuttles and their deadlights, which will not be accessible during navigation, shall be closed and secured before the ship leaves port. 
(f) (i) No sidescuttles shall be fitted in any spaces which are appropriated exclusively to the carriage of cargo or coal. 
(ii) Sidescuttles may, however, be fitted in spaces appropriated alternatively to the carriage of cargo or passengers, but they shall be of such construction as will effectively prevent any person opening them or their deadlights without the consent of the master of the ship. 
(iii) If cargo is carried in such spaces, the sidescuttles and their deadlights shall be closed watertight and locked before the cargo is shipped and such closing and locking shall be recorded in such log books as may be prescribed by the Administration. 
(g) Automatic ventilating sidescuttles shall not be fitted in the shell plating below the margin line without the special sanction of the Administration. 
(h) The number of scuppers, sanitary discharges and other similar openings in the shell plating shall be reduced to the minimum either by making each discharge serve for as many as possible of the sanitary and other pipes, or in any other satisfactory manner. 
(i) (i) All inlets and discharges in the shell plating shall be fitted with efficient and accessible arrangements for preventing the accidental admission of water into the ship. Lead or other heat sensitive materials shall not be used for pipes fitted outboard of shell valves in inlets or discharges, or any other application where the deterioration of such pipes in the event of fire would give rise to danger of flooding. 
(ii) (1) Except as provided in sub-paragraph (iii) of this paragraph, each separate discharge led through the shell plating from spaces below the margin line shall be provided either with one automatic non-return valve fitted with a positive means of closing it from above the bulkhead deck, or, alternatively, with two automatic non-return valves without such means, the upper of which is so situated above the deepest subdivision load line as to be always accessible for examination under service conditions, and is of a type which is normally closed. 
(2) Where a valve with positive means of closing is fitted, the operating position above the bulkhead deck shall always be readily accessible, and means shall be provided for indicating whether the valve is open or closed. 
(iii) Main and auxiliary sea inlets and discharges in connexion with machinery shall be fitted with readily accessible cocks or valves between the pipes and shell plating or between the pipes and fabricated boxes attached to the shell plating. 
(j) (i) Gangway, cargo and coaling ports fitted below the margin line shall be of sufficient strength. They shall be effectively closed and secured watertight before the ship leaves port, and shall be kept closed during navigation. 
(ii) Such ports shall be in no case fitted so as to have their lowest point below the deepest subdivision load line. 
(k) (i) The inboard opening of each ash-shoot, rubbish-shoot, etc. shall be fitted with an efficient cover. 
(ii) If the inboard opening is situated below the margin line, the cover shall be watertight, and in addition an automatic non-return valve shall be fitted in the shoot in an easily accessible position above the deepest subdivision load line. When the shoot is not in use both the cover and the valve shall be kept closed and secured. 

Regulation 15 
Construction and initial tests of watertight doors, sidescuttles, etc. 
(a) (i) The design, materials and construction of all watertight doors, sidescuttles, gangway, cargo and coaling ports, valves, pipes, ash-shoots and rubbish- shoots referred to in these Regulations shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration. 
(ii) The frames of vertical watertight doors shall have no groove at the bottom in which dirt might lodge and prevent the door closing properly. 
(iii) All cocks and valves for sea inlets and discharges below the bulkhead deck and all fittings outboard of such cocks and valves shall be made of steel, bronze or other approved ductile material. Ordinary cast iron or similar materials shall not be used. 
(b) Each watertight door shall be tested by water pressure to a head up to the bulkhead deck. The test shall be made before the ship is put in service, either before or after the door is fitted. 

Regulation 16 
Construction and initial tests of watertight decks, trunks, etc. 
(a) Watertight decks, trunks, tunnels, duct keels and ventilators shall be of the same strength as watertight bulkheads at corresponding levels. The means used for making them watertight, and the arrangements adopted for closing openings in them, shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration. Watertight ventilators and trunks shall be carried at least up to the bulkhead deck. 
(b) After completion, a hose or flooding test shall be applied to watertight decks and a hose test to watertight trunks, tunnels and ventilators. 

Regulation 17 
Watertight integrity above the margin line 
(a) The Administration may require that all reasonable and practicable measures shall be taken to limit the entry and spread of water above the bulkhead deck. Such measures may include partial bulkheads or webs. When partial watertight bulkheads and webs are fitted on the bulkhead deck, above or in the immediate vicinity of main subdivision bulkheads, they shall have watertight shell and bulkhead deck connexions so as to restrict the flow of water along the deck when the ship is in a heeled damaged condition. Where the partial watertight bulkhead does not line up with the bulkhead below, the bulkhead deck between shall be made effectively watertight. 
(b) The bulkhead deck or a deck above it shall be weathertight in the sense that in ordinary sea conditions water will not penetrate in a downward direction. All openings in the exposed weather deck shall have coamings of ample height and strength and shall be provided with efficient means for expeditiously closing them weathertight. Freeing ports, open rails and/or scuppers shall be fitted as necessary for rapidly clearing the weather deck of water under all weather conditions. 
(c) Sidescuttles, gangway, cargo and coaling ports and other means for closing openings in the shell plating above the margin line shall be of efficient design and construction and of sufficient strength having regard to the spaces in which they are fitted and their positions relative to the deepest subdivision load line. 
(d) Efficient inside deadlights, arranged so that they can be easily and effectively closed and secured watertight, shall be provided for all sidescuttles to spaces below the first deck above the bulkhead deck. 

Regulation 18 
Bilge pumping arrangements in passenger ships 
(a) Ships shall be provided with an efficient bilge pumping plant capable of pumping from and draining any watertight compartment which is neither a permanent oil compartment nor a permanent water compartment under all practicable conditions after a casualty whether the ship is upright or listed. For this purpose wing suctions will generally be necessary except in narrow compartments at the ends of the ship, where one suction may be sufficient. In compartments of unusual form, additional suctions may be required. Arrangements shall be made whereby water in the compartment may find its way to the suction pipes. Where in relation to particular compartments the Administration is satisfied that the provision of drainage may be undesirable, it may allow such provision to be dispensed with if calculations made in accordance with the conditions laid down in paragraph (b) of Regulation 7 of this Chapter show that the safety of the ship will not be impaired. Efficient means shall be provided for draining water from insulated holds. 
(b) (i) Ships shall have at least three power pumps connected to the bilge main, one of which may be attached to the propelling unit. Where the criterion numeral is 30 or more, one additional independent power pump shall be provided. 
(ii) The requirements are summarized in the following table: 
Criterion numeral 
Less than 30 

30 and over 







Main engine pump (may be replaced by one independent pump) 

1

(iii) Sanitary, ballast and general service pumps may be accepted as independent power bilge pumps if fitted with the necessary connexions to the bilge pumping system. 
(c) Where practicable, the power bilge pumps shall be placed in separate watertight compartments so arranged or situated that these compartments will not readily be flooded by the same damage. If the engines and boilers are in two or more watertight compartments, the pumps available for bilge service shall be distributed throughout these compartments as far as is possible. 
(d) On ships 91.5 metres (300 feet) or more in length or having a criterion numeral of 30 or more, the arrangements shall be such that at least one power pump shall be available for use in all ordinary circumstances in which a ship may be flooded at sea. This requirement will be satisfied if: 
(i) one of the required pumps is an emergency pump of a reliable submersible type having a source of power situated above the bulkhead deck; or 
(ii) the pumps and their sources of power are so disposed throughout the length of the ship that under any condition of flooding which the ship is required to withstand, at least one pump in an undamaged compartment will be available. 
(e) With the exception of additional pumps which may be provided for peak compartments only, each required bilge pump shall be arranged to draw water from any space required to be drained by paragraph (a) of this Regulation. 
(f) (i) Each power bilge pump shall be capable of giving a speed of water through the required main bilge pipe of not less than 122 metres (400 feet) per minute. Independent power bilge pumps situated in machinery spaces shall have direct suctions from these spaces, except that not more than two such suctions shall be required in any one space. Where two or more such suctions are provided there shall be at least one on the port side and one on the starboard side. The Administration may require independent power bilge pumps situated in other spaces to have separate direct suctions. Direct suctions shall be suitably arranged and those in a machinery space shall be of a diameter not less than that required for the bilge main. 
(ii) In coal-burning ships there shall be provided in the stokehold, in addition to the other suctions required by this Regulation, a flexible suction hose of suitable diameter and sufficient length, capable of being connected to the suction side of an independent power pump. 
(g) (i) In addition to the direct bilge suction or suctions required by paragraph (f) of this Regulation there shall be in the machinery space a direct suction from the main circulating pump leading to the drainage level of the machinery space and fitted with a non-return valve. The diameter of this direct suction pipe shall be at least two-thirds of the diameter of the pump inlet in the case of steamships, and of the same diameter as the pump inlet in the case of motorships. 
(ii) Where in the opinion of the Administration the main circulating pump is not suitable for this purpose, a direct emergency bilge suction shall be led from the largest available independent power driven pump to the drainage level of the machinery space; the suction shall be of the same diameter as the main inlet of the pump used. The capacity of the pump so connected shall exceed that of a required bilge pump by an amount satisfactory to the Administration. 
(iii) The spindles of the sea inlet and direct suction valves shall extend well above the engine room platform. 
(iv) Where the fuel is, or may be, coal and there is no watertight bulkhead between the engines and the boilers, a direct discharge overboard or alternatively a by-pass to the circulating pump discharge, shall be fitted from any circulating pump used in compliance with sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph. 
(h) (i) All pipes from the pumps which are required for draining cargo or machinery spaces shall be entirely distinct from pipes which may be used for filling or emptying spaces where water or oil is carried. 
(ii) All bilge pipes used in or under coal bunkers or fuel storage tanks or in boiler or machinery spaces, including spaces in which oil-settling tanks or oil fuel pumping units are situated, shall be of steel or other approved material. 
(i) The diameter of the bilge main shall be calculated according to the following formulae provided that the actual internal diameter of the bilge main may be of the nearest standard size acceptable to the Administration. 

where: 
d = internal diameter of the bilge main in millimetres, 
L and B are the length and the breadth of the ship in metres, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter, and 
D = moulded depth of the ship to bulkhead deck in metres; 
or 

where: 
d = internal diameter of the bilge main in inches, 
L and B are the length and the breadth of the ship in feet, as defined in Regulation 2 of this Chapter, and 
D = moulded depth of the ship to bulkhead deck in feet. 
The diameter of the bilge branch pipes shall be determined by rules to be made by the Administration. 
(j) The arrangement of the bilge and ballast pumping system shall be such as to prevent the possibility of water passing from the sea and from water ballast spaces into the cargo and machinery spaces, or from one compartment to another. Special provision shall be made to prevent any deep tank having bilge and ballast connexions being inadvertently run up from the sea when containing cargo, or pumped out through a bilge pipe when containing water ballast. 
(k) Provision shall be made to prevent the compartment served by any bilge suction pipe being flooded in the event of the pipe being severed, or otherwise damaged by collision or grounding in any other compartment. For this purpose, where the pipe is at any part situated nearer the side of the ship than one-fifth the breadth of the ship (measured at right angles to the centre line at the level of the deepest subdivision load line), or in a duct keel, a non-return valve shall be fitted to the pipe in the compartment containing the open end. 
(l) All the distribution boxes, cocks and valves in connexion with the bilge pumping arrangements shall be in positions which are accessible at all times under ordinary circumstances. They shall be so arranged that, in the event of flooding, one of the bilge pumps may be operative on any compartment; in addition, damage to a pump or its pipe connecting to the bilge main outboard of a line drawn at one-fifth of the breadth of the ship shall not put the bilge system out of action. If there is only one system of pipes common to all the pumps, the necessary cocks or valves for controlling the bilge suctions must be capable of being operated from above the bulkhead deck. Where in addition to the main bilge pumping system an emergency bilge pumping system is provided, it shall be independent of the main system and so arranged that a pump is capable of operating on any compartment under flooding conditions; in that case only the cocks and valves necessary for the operation of the emergency system need be capable of being operated from above the bulkhead deck. 
(m) All cocks and valves mentioned in paragraph (l) of this Regulation which can be operated from above the bulkhead deck shall have their controls at their place of operation clearly marked and provided with means to indicate whether they are open or closed. 

Regulation 19 
Stability information for passenger ships and cargo ships
[9] 
(a) Every passenger ship and cargo ship shall be inclined upon its completion and the elements of its stability determined. The master shall be supplied with such reliable information as is necessary to enable him by rapid and simple processes to obtain accurate guidance as to the stability of the ship under varying conditions of service, and a copy shall be furnished to the Administration. 
(b) Where any alterations are made to a ship so as to materially affect the stability information supplied to the master, amended stability information shall be provided. If necessary the ship shall be re-inclined. 
(c) The Administration may allow the inclining test of an individual ship to be dispensed with provided basic stability data are available from the inclining test of a sister ship and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that reliable stability information for the exempted ship can be obtained from such basic data. 
(d) The Administration may also allow the inclining test of an individual ship or class of ships, especially designed for the carriage of liquids or ore in bulk, to be dispensed with when reference to existing data for similar ships clearly indicates that due to the ship's proportions and arrangements more than sufficient metacentric height will be available in all probable loading conditions. 

Regulation 20 
Damage control plans 
There shall be permanently exhibited, for the guidance of the officer in charge of the ship, plans showing clearly for each deck and hold the boundaries of the watertight compartments, the openings therein with the means of closure and position of any controls thereof, and the arrangements for the correction of any list due to flooding. In addition, booklets containing the aforementioned information shall be made available to the officers of the ship. 

Regulation 21 
Marking, periodical operation and inspection of watertight doors, etc. 
(a) This Regulation applies to new and existing ships. 
(b) Drills for the operating of watertight doors, sidescuttles, valves and closing mechanisms of scuppers, ash-shoots and rubbish-shoots shall take place weekly.

(b) Special attention shall be given to the insulation of aluminium alloy components of columns, stanchions and other structural members required to support lifeboat and liferaft stowage, launching and embarkation areas, and "A" and "B" Class divisions to ensure: 
(i) that for such members supporting lifeboat and liferaft areas and "A" Class divisions the temperature rise limitation specified in paragraph (a) of this Regulation shall apply at the end of one hour; and 
(ii) that for such members required to support "B" Class divisions, the temperature rise limitation specified in paragraph (a) of this Regulation shall apply at the end of one half-hour. 
(c) Crowns and casings of machinery spaces of Category A shall be of steel construction adequately insulated and openings therein, if any, shall be suitably arranged and protected to prevent the spread of fire. 

Regulation 18 
Main vertical zones and horizontal zones 
(a) The hull, superstructure and deckhouses shall be subdivided into main vertical zones by "A" Class divisions. Steps and recesses shall be kept to a minimum, but where they are necessary, they shall also be "A" Class divisions. These divisions shall have insulation values in accordance with the applicable tables in Regulation 20 of this Chapter. 
(b) As far as practicable, the bulkheads forming the boundaries of the main vertical zones above the bulkhead deck shall be in line with watertight sub-division bulkheads situated immediately below the bulkhead deck. 
(c) Such bulkheads shall extend from deck to deck and to the shell or other boundaries. 
(d) Where a main vertical zone is subdivided by horizontal "A" Class divisions into horizontal zones for the purpose of providing an appropriate barrier between sprinklered and non-sprinklered zones of the ship the divisions shall extend between adjacent main vertical zone bulkheads and to the shell or exterior boundaries of the ship and shall be insulated in accordance with the fire insulation and integrity values given in Table 3 of Regulation 20 of this Chapter. 
(e) On ships designed for special purposes, such as automobile or railroad car ferries, where the provision of main vertical zone bulkheads would defeat the purpose for which the ship is intended, equivalent means for controlling and limiting a fire shall be substituted and specially approved by the Administration. 
Provided that in a ship with special category spaces, any such space shall comply with the applicable provisions of Regulation 30 of this Chapter, and in so far as such compliance would be inconsistent with compliance with other requirements of this Part of this Chapter, the requirements of Regulation 30 shall prevail. 

Regulation 19 
Bulkheads within a main vertical zone 
(a) All bulkheads which are not required to be "A" Class divisions shall be at least "B" Class or "C" Class divisions as prescribed in the tables in Regulation 20 of this Chapter. All such divisions may be faced with combustible materials in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 27 of this Chapter. 
(b) All corridor bulkheads where not required to be "A" Class shall be "B" Class divisions which shall extend from deck to deck except: 
(i) when continuous "B" Class ceilings and/or linings are fitted on both sides of the bulkhead, the portion of the bulkhead behind the continuous ceiling or lining shall be of material which in thickness and composition is acceptable in the construction of "B" Class divisions but which shall be required to meet "B" Class integrity standards only in so far as is reasonable and practicable in the opinion of the Administration; 
(ii) in the case of a ship protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of Regulation 12 of this Chapter, the corridor bulkheads of "B" Class materials may terminate at a ceiling in the corridor provided such a ceiling is of material which in thickness and composition is acceptable in the construction of "B" Class divisions. Notwithstanding the requirements of Regulation 20 of this Chapter, such bulkheads and ceilings shall be required to meet "B" Class integrity standards only in so far as is reasonable and practicable in the opinion of the Administration. All doors and frames in such bulkheads shall be of incombustible materials and shall be constructed and erected so as to provide substantial fire resistance to the satisfaction of the Administration. 
(c) All bulkheads required to be "B" Class divisions, except corridor bulkheads, shall extend from deck to deck and to the shell or other boundaries unless continuous "B" Class ceilings and/or linings are fitted on both sides of the bulkhead in which case the bulkhead may terminate at the continuous ceiling or lining. 

Regulation 20 
Fire integrity of bulkheads and decks 
(a) In addition to complying with the specific provisions for fire integrity of bulkheads and decks mentioned elsewhere in the Regulations of this Part, the minimum fire integrity of all bulkheads and decks shall be as prescribed in Tables 1 to 4 in this Regulation. Where, due to any particular structural arrangements in the ship, difficulty is experienced in determining from the tables the minimum fire integrity value of any divisions, such values shall be determined to the satisfaction of the Administration. 
(b) The following requirements shall govern application of the tables: 
(i) Table 1 shall apply to bulkheads bounding main vertical zones or horizontal zones. 
Table 2 shall apply to bulkheads not bounding either main vertical zones or horizontal zones. 
Table 3 shall apply to decks forming steps in main vertical zones or bounding horizontal zones. 
Table 4 shall apply to decks not forming steps in main vertical zones nor bounding horizontal zones. 
(ii) For the purpose of determining the appropriate fire integrity standards to be applied to boundaries between adjacent spaces, such spaces are classified according to their fire risk as shown in Categories (1) to (14) below. Where the contents and use of a space are such that there is a doubt as to its classification for the purpose of this Regulation, it shall be treated as a space within the relevant category having the most stringent boundary requirements.

(iii) Where a single value is shown for the fire integrity of a boundary between two spaces, that value shall apply in all cases. 
(iv) In determining the applicable fire integrity standard of a boundary between two spaces within a main vertical zone or horizontal zone which is not protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of Regulation 12 of this Chapter or between such zones neither of which is so protected, the higher of the two values given in the tables shall apply. 
(v) In determining the applicable fire integrity standard of a boundary between two spaces within a main vertical zone or horizontal zone which is protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of Regulation 12 of this Chapter or between such zones both of which are so protected, the lesser of the two values given in the tables shall apply. In instances where a sprinklered zone and a non-sprinklered zone meet within accommodation and service spaces, the higher of the two values given in the tables shall apply to the division between the zones. 
(vi) Where adjacent spaces are in the same numerical category and the superscript "1" appears in the tables, a bulkhead or deck between such spaces need not be fitted if deemed unnecessary by the Administration. For example, in Category (12) a bulkhead need not be required between a galley and its annexed pantries provided the pantry bulkheads and decks maintain the integrity of the galley boundaries. A bulkhead is, however, required between a galley and a machinery space even though both spaces are in Category (12). 
(vii) Where the superscript "2" appears in the tables, the lesser insulation value may be permitted only if at least one of the adjoining spaces is protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of Regulation 12 of this Chapter. 
(viii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Regulation 19 of this Chapter, there are no special requirements for material or integrity of boundaries where only a dash appears in the tables. 
(ix) The Administration shall determine in respect of Category (5) spaces whether the insulation values in Table 1 or 2 shall apply to ends of deckhouses and superstructures, and whether the insulation values in Table 3 or 4 shall apply to weather decks. In no case shall the requirements of Category (5) of Tables 1 to 4 necessitate enclosure of spaces which in the opinion of the Administration need not be enclosed. 
(c) Continuous "B" Class ceilings or linings, in association with the relevant decks or bulkheads, may be accepted as contributing wholly or in part, to the required insulation and integrity of a division. 
(d) In approving structural fire protection details, the Administration shall have regard to the risk of heat transmission at intersections and terminal points of required thermal barriers.

Regulation 21 
Means of escape 
(a) In and from all passenger and crew spaces and spaces in which the crew is normally employed, other than machinery spaces, stairways and ladders shall be arranged to provide ready means of escape to the lifeboat and liferaft embarkation deck. In particular, the following provisions shall be complied with: 
(i) Below the bulkhead deck, two means of escape, at least one of which shall be independent of watertight doors, shall be provided from each watertight compartment or similarly restricted space or group of spaces. Exceptionally, the Administration may dispense with one of the means of escape, due regard being paid to the nature and location of spaces and to the number of persons who normally might be quartered or employed there. 
(ii) Above the bulkhead deck, there shall be at least two means of escape from each main vertical zone or similarly restricted space or group of spaces at least one of which shall give access to a stairway forming a vertical escape. 
(iii) At least one of the means of escape required by sub-paragraphs (a)(i) and (ii) of this Regulation shall be by means of a readily accessible enclosed stairway, which shall provide continuous fire shelter from the level of its origin to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks or the highest level served by the stairway, whichever level is the highest. However, where an Administration has granted dispensation under the provisions of sub-paragraph (a)(i) of this Regulation the sole means of escape shall provide safe escape to the satisfaction of the Administration. The width, number and continuity of the stairways shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration. 
(iv) Protection of access from the stairway enclosures to the lifeboat and liferaft embarkation areas shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration. 
(v) Lifts shall not be considered as forming one of the required means of escape. 
(vi) Stairways serving only a space and a balcony in that space shall not be considered as forming one of the required means of escape. 
(vii) If a radiotelegraph station has no direct access to the weather deck, two means of escape shall be provided from such station. 
(viii) Dead-end corridors exceeding 13 metres (43 feet) shall not be permitted. 
(b) (i) In special category spaces the number and disposition of the means of escape both below and above the bulkhead deck shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration, and in general the safety of access to the embarkation deck shall be at least equivalent to that provided for under sub-paragraphs (a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this Regulation. 
(ii) One of the escape routes from the machinery spaces where the crew is normally employed shall avoid direct access to any special category space. 
(c) Two means of escape shall be provided from each machinery space. In particular, the following provisions shall be complied with: 
(i) Where the space is below the bulkhead deck the two means of escape shall consist of either: 
(1) two sets of steel ladders as widely separated as possible, leading to doors in the upper part of the space similarly separated and from which access is provided to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks. One of these ladders shall provide continuous fire shelter from the lower part of the space to a safe position outside the space; or 
(2) one steel ladder leading to a door in the upper part of the space from which access is provided to the embarkation deck and a steel door capable of being operated from each side and which provides a safe escape route to the embarkation deck. 
(ii) Where the space is above the bulkhead deck, two means of escape shall be as widely separated as possible and the doors leading from such means of escape shall be in position from which access is provided to the appropriate lifeboat and liferaft embarkation decks. Where such escapes require the use of ladders these shall be of steel. 
Provided that in a ship of less than 1,000 tons gross tonnage, the Administration may dispense with one of the means of escape due regard being paid to the width and disposition of the upper part of the space; and in a ship of 1,000 tons gross tonnage and above, the Administration may dispense with one means of escape from any such space so long as either a door or a steel ladder provides a safe escape route to the embarkation deck due regard being paid to the nature and location of the space and whether persons are normally employed in that space. 

Regulation 22 
Protection of stairways and lifts in accommodation and service spaces 
(a) All stairways shall be of steel frame construction except where the Administration sanctions the use of other equivalent material, and shall be within enclosures formed of "A" Class divisions, with positive means of closure at all openings, except that: 
(i) a stairway connecting only two decks need not be enclosed, provided the integrity of the deck is maintained by proper bulkheads or doors at one between deck space. When a stairway is closed at one between deck space, the stairway enclosure shall be protected in accordance with the tables for decks in Regulation 20 of this Chapter; 
(ii) stairways may be fitted in the open in a public space, provided they lie wholly within such public space. 
(b) Stairway enclosures shall have direct communication with the corridors and be of sufficient area to prevent congestion, having in view the number of persons likely to use them in an emergency. In so far as practicable, stairway enclosures shall not give direct access to cabins, service lockers, or other enclosed spaces containing combustibles in which a fire is likely to originate. 
(c) Lift trunks shall be so fitted as to prevent the passage of smoke and flame from one between deck to another and shall be provided with means of closing so as to permit the control of draught and smoke. 

Regulation 23 
Openings in "A" Class divisions 
(a) Where "A" Class divisions are pierced for the passage of electric cables, pipes, trunks, ducts, etc., for girders, beams or other structures, arrangements shall be made to ensure that the fire resistance is not impaired, subject to the provisions of paragraph (g) of this Regulation. 
(b) Where of necessity, a ventilation duct passes through a main vertical zone bulkhead, a fail-safe automatic closing fire damper shall be fitted adjacent to the bulkhead. The damper shall also be capable of being manually closed from each side of the bulkhead. The operating position shall be readily accessible and be marked in red light-reflecting colour. The duct between the bulkhead and the damper shall be of steel or other equivalent material and, if necessary, to an insulating standard such as to comply with paragraph (a) of this Regulation. The damper shall be fitted on at least one side of the bulkhead with a visible indicator showing if the damper is in the open position. 
(c) Except for hatches between cargo, special category, store, and baggage spaces, and between such spaces and the weather decks, all openings shall be provided with permanently attached means of closing which shall be at least as effective for resisting fires as the divisions in which they are fitted. 
(d) The construction of all doors and door frames in "A" Class divisions, with the means of securing them when closed, shall provide resistance to fire as well as to the passage of smoke and flame, as far as practicable, equivalent to that of the bulkheads in which the doors are situated. Such doors and door frames shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material. Watertight doors need not be insulated. 
(e) It shall be possible for each door to be opened and closed from each side of the bulkhead by one person only. 
(f) Fire doors in main vertical zone bulkheads and stairway enclosures, other than power-operated watertight doors and those which are normally locked, shall be of the self-closing type capable of closing against an inclination of 31/2 degrees opposing closure. The speed of door closure shall, if necessary, be controlled so as to prevent undue danger to personnel. All such doors, except those that are normally closed, shall be capable of release from a control station, either simultaneously or in groups, and also individually from a position at the door. The release mechanism shall be so designed that the door will automatically close in the event of disruption of the control system; however, approved power-operated watertight doors will be considered acceptable for this purpose. Hold-back hooks, not subject to control station release, will not be permitted. When double swing doors are permitted, they shall have a latch arrangement which is automatically engaged by the operation of the door release system. 
(g) Where a space is protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of Regulation 12 of this Chapter or fitted with a continuous "B" Class ceiling, openings in decks not forming steps in main vertical zones nor bounding horizontal zones shall be closed reasonably tight and such decks shall meet the "A" Class integrity requirements in so far as is reasonable and practicable in the opinion of the Administration. 
(h) The requirements for "A" Class integrity of the outer boundaries of a ship shall not apply to glass partitions, windows and sidescuttles. Similarly, the requirements for "A" Class integrity shall not apply to exterior doors in superstructures and deckhouses. 

Regulation 24 
Openings in "B" Class divisions 
(a) Where "B" Class divisions are penetrated for the passage of electrical cables, pipes, trunks, ducts, etc., or for the fitting of ventilation terminals, lighting fixtures and similar devices, arrangements shall be made to ensure that the fire resistance is not impaired. 
(b) Doors and door frames in "B" Class divisions and means of securing them shall provide a method of closure which shall have resistance to fire as far as practicable equivalent to the divisions except that ventilation openings may be permitted in the lower portion of such doors. Where such opening is in or under a door the total net area of any such opening or openings shall not exceed 0.05 square metres (78 square inches). When such opening is cut in a door it shall be fitted with a grill made of non-combustible material. Doors shall be non-combustible. 
(c) The requirements for "B" Class integrity of the outer boundaries of a ship shall not apply to glass partitions, windows and sidescuttles. Similarly, the requirements for "B" Class integrity shall not apply to exterior doors in superstructures and deckhouses. 
(d) Where an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of Regulation 12 of this Chapter is fitted: 
(i) openings in decks not forming steps in main vertical zones nor bounding horizontal zones shall be closed reasonably tight and such decks shall meet the "B" Class integrity requirements in so far as is reasonable and practicable in the opinion of the Administration; and 
(ii) openings in corridor bulkheads of "B" Class materials shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 19 of this Chapter. 

Regulation 25 
Ventilation systems 
(a) In general, the ventilation fans shall be so disposed that the ducts reaching the various spaces remain within the main vertical zone. 
(b) Where ventilation systems penetrate decks, precautions shall be taken, in addition to those relating to the fire integrity of the deck required by Regulation 23 of this Chapter, to reduce the likelihood of smoke and hot gases passing from one between deck space to another through the system. In addition to insulation requirements contained in this Regulation, vertical ducts shall, if necessary, be insulated as required by the appropriate tables in Regulation 20 of this Chapter. 
(c) The main inlets and outlets of all ventilation systems shall be capable of being closed from outside the space being ventilated. 
(d) Except in cargo spaces, ventilation ducts shall be constructed of the following materials: 
(i) Ducts not less than 0.075 square metres (116 square inches) in sectional area and all vertical ducts serving more than a single between deck space shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material. 
(ii) Ducts less than 0.075 square metres (116 square inches) in sectional area shall be constructed of non-combustible materials. Where such ducts penetrate "A" or "B" Class divisions due regard shall be given to ensuring the fire integrity of the division. 
(iii) Short lengths of duct, not in general exceeding 0.02 square metres (31 square inches) in sectional area nor 2 metres (79 inches) in length, need not be incombustible provided that all of the following conditions are met: 
(1) the duct is constructed of a material of restricted fire risk to the satisfaction of the Administration; 
(2) the duct is used only at the terminal end of the ventilation system; and 
(3) the duct is not located closer than 0.6 metres (24 inches) measured along its length to a penetration of an "A" or "B" Class division, including continuous "B" Class ceilings. 
(e) Where a stairway enclosure is ventilated, the duct or ducts (if any) shall be taken from the fan room independently of other ducts in the ventilation system and shall not serve any other space. 
(f) All power ventilation, except machinery and cargo spaces ventilation and any alternative system which may be required under paragraph (h) of this Regulation, shall be fitted with controls so grouped that all fans may be stopped from either of two separate positions which shall be situated as far apart as practicable. Controls provided for the power ventilation serving machinery spaces shall also be grouped so as to be operable from two positions, one of which shall be outside such spaces. Fans serving power ventilation systems to cargo spaces shall be capable of being stopped from a safe position outside such spaces. 
(g) Where they pass through accommodation spaces or spaces containing combustible materials, the exhaust ducts from galley ranges shall be constructed of "A" Class divisions. Each exhaust duct shall be fitted with: 
(i) a grease trap readily removable for cleaning; 
(ii) a fire damper located in the lower end of the duct; 
(iii) arrangements, operable from within the galley, for shutting off the exhaust fan; and 
(iv) fixed means for extinguishing a fire within the duct. 
(h) Such measures as are practicable shall be taken in respect of control stations outside machinery spaces in order to ensure that ventilation, visibility and freedom from smoke are maintained, so that in the event of fire the machinery and equipment contained therein may be supervised and continue to function effectively. Alternative and separate means of air supply shall be provided; air inlets of the two sources of supply shall be so disposed that the risk of both inlets drawing in smoke simultaneously is minimized. At the discretion of the Administration, such requirements need not apply to control stations situated on, and opening on to, an open deck, or where local closing arrangements would be equally effective. 
(i) Ducts provided for ventilation of machinery spaces of Category A shall not in general pass through accommodation, service spaces or control stations, except that the Administration may permit relaxation from this requirement, provided that: 
(i) the ducts are constructed of steel, and are insulated to "A-60" standard; or 
(ii) the ducts are constructed of steel and are fitted with an automatic fire damper close to the boundary penetrated and are insulated to "A-60" standard from the machinery space to a point at least 5 metres (16 feet) beyond the fire damper. 
(j) Ducts provided for ventilation of accommodation, service spaces, or control stations shall not in general pass through machinery spaces of Category A, except that the Administration may permit relaxation from this requirement provided that the ducts are constructed of steel and automatic fire dampers are fitted close the boundaries penetrated. 

Regulation 26 
Windows and sidescuttles 
(a) All windows and sidescuttles in bulkheads within accommodation and service spaces and control stations other than those to which the provisions of paragraph (h) of Regulation 23 and paragraph (c) of Regulation 24 of this Chapter apply, shall be constructed so as to preserve the integrity requirements of the type of bulkheads in which they are fitted. 
(b) Notwithstanding the requirements of the tables in Regulation 20 of this Chapter: 
(i) All windows and sidescuttles in bulkheads separating accommodation and service spaces and control stations from weather shall be constructed with frames of steel or other suitable material. The glass shall be retained by a metal glazing bead or angle. 
(ii) Special attention shall be given to the fire integrity of windows facing open or enclosed lifeboat and liferaft embarkation areas and to windows situated below such areas in such a position that their failure during a fire would impede the launching of, or embarkation into, lifeboats or liferafts. 

Regulation 27 
Restriction of combustible materials 
(a) Except in cargo spaces, mail rooms, baggage rooms, or refrigerated compartments of service spaces, all linings, grounds, ceilings and insulations shall be of non-combustible materials. Partial bulkheads or decks used to subdivide a space for utility or artistic treatment shall also be of non-combustible material. 
(b) Vapour barriers and adhesives used in conjunction with insulation, as well as insulation of pipe fittings, for cold service systems need not be non-combustible, but they shall be kept to the minimum quantity practicable and their exposed surfaces shall have qualities of resistance to the propagation of flame to the satisfaction of the Administration. 
(c) Bulkheads, linings and ceilings, in all accommodation and service spaces may have combustible veneer, provided that such veneer shall not exceed 2 millimetres (1/12 inch) within any such spaces except corridors, stairway enclosures and control stations where it shall not exceed 1.5 millimetres (1/17 inch). 
(d) The total volume of combustible facings, mouldings, decorations and veneers in any accommodation and service space shall not exceed a volume equivalent to 2.5 millimetres (1/10 inch) veneer on the combined area of the walls and ceilings. In the case of ships fitted with an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of Regulation 12 of this Chapter, the above volume may include some combustible material used for erection of "C" Class divisions. 
(e) All exposed surfaces in corridors or stairway enclosures and surfaces in concealed or inaccessible spaces in accommodation and service spaces and control stations shall have low flame-spread characteristics.[18] 
(f) Furniture in the passages and stairway enclosures shall be kept to a minimum. 
(g) Paints, varnishes and other finishes used on exposed interior surfaces shall not be of a nature to offer an undue fire hazard in the judgment of the Administration and shall not be capable of producing excessive quantities of smoke or other toxic properties. 
(h) Primary deck coverings, if applied, within accommodation and service spaces and control stations, shall be of approved material which will not readily ignite, or give rise to toxic or explosive hazards at elevated temperatures.[19] 
(i) Waste-paper receptacles shall be constructed of non-combustible materials and with solid sides and bottoms. 

Regulation 28 
Miscellaneous items 
Requirements applicable to all portions of the ship 
(a) Pipes penetrating "A" or "B" Class divisions shall be of a material approved by the Administration having regard to the temperature such divisions are required to withstand. Pipes conveying oil or combustible liquids shall be of a material approved by the Administration having regard to the fire risk. Materials readily rendered ineffective by heat shall not be used for overboard scuppers, sanitary discharges, and other outlets which are close to the water-line and where the failure of the material in the event of fire would give rise to danger of flooding. 
Requirements applicable to accommodation and service spaces, control stations, corridors and stairways 
(b) (i) Air spaces enclosed behind ceilings, panelling or linings shall be suitably divided by close-fitting draught stops not more than 14 metres (46 feet) apart. 
(ii) In the vertical direction, such spaces, including those behind linings of stairways, trunks, etc., shall be closed at each deck. 
(c) The construction of ceiling and bulkheading shall be such that it will be possible, without impairing the efficiency of the fire protection, for the fire patrols to detect any smoke originating in concealed and inaccessible places, except where in the opinion of the Administration there is no risk of fire originating in such places. 

Regulation 29 
Automatic sprinkler and fire alarm and fire detection systems or automatic fire alarm and fire detection systems 
In any ship to which this Part applies there shall be installed throughout each separate zone, whether vertical or horizontal, in all accommodation and service spaces and, where it is considered necessary by the Administration, in control stations, except spaces which afford no substantial fire risk (such as void spaces, sanitary spaces, etc.) either: 
(i) an automatic sprinkler and fire alarm and fire detection system of an approved type, complying with the provisions of Regulation 12 of this Chapter and installed and so arranged as to protect such spaces; or 
(ii) an automatic fire alarm and fire detection system of an approved type, complying with the provisions of Regulation 13 of this Chapter, and installed and so arranged as to detect the presence of fire in such spaces. 

Regulation 30 
Protection of special category spaces 
Provisions applicable to special category spaces whether above or below the bulkhead deck 
(a) General 
(i) The basic principle underlying the provisions in this Regulation is that as normal main vertical zoning may not be practicable in special category spaces, equivalent protection must be obtained in such spaces on the basis of a horizontal zone concept and the provisions of an efficient fixed fire-extinguishing system. Under this concept a horizontal zone for the purpose of this Regulation may include special category spaces on more than one deck provided that the overall height of the zone does not exceed 10 metres (33 feet). 
(ii) All requirements laid down in Regulations 23 and 25 of this Chapter for maintaining the integrity of vertical zones shall be applied equally to decks and bulkheads forming the boundaries separating horizontal zones from each other and from the remainder of the ship. 
(b) Structural protection 
(i) Boundary bulkheads of special category spaces shall be insulated as required for Category (11) spaces in Table 1 of Regulation 20 of this Chapter and the horizontal boundaries as required for Category (11) spaces in Table 3 of that Regulation. 
(ii) Indicators shall be provided on the navigating bridge which shall indicate when any fire door leading to or from the special category spaces is closed. 
(c) Fixed fire-extinguishing system[20] 
Each special category space shall be fitted with an approved fixed pressure water-spraying system for manual operation which shall protect all parts of any deck and vehicle platform, if any, in such space, provided that the Administration may permit the use of any other fixed fire-extinguishing system that has been shown by full-scale test in conditions simulating a flowing petrol fire in a special category space to be not less effective in controlling fires likely to occur in such a space. 
(d) Patrols and detection 
(i) An efficient patrol system shall be maintained in special category spaces. In any such space in which the patrol is not maintained by a continuous fire watch at all times during the voyage there shall be provided in that space an automatic fire detection system of an approved type. 
(ii) Manual fire alarms shall be provided as necessary throughout the special category spaces and one shall be placed close to each exit from such spaces. 
(e) Fire-extinguishing equipment 
There shall be provided in each special category space: 
(i) a number of hydrants with hoses and dual-purpose nozzles of an approved type so arranged that at least two jets of water each from a single length of hose not emanating from the same hydrant may reach any part of such space; 
(ii) at least three water fog applicators; 
(iii) one portable applicator unit complying with the provisions of Regulation 7(d) of this Chapter, provided that at least two such units are available in the ship for use in such spaces; and 
(iv) such number of portable fire extinguishers of an approved type as the Administration may deem sufficient. 
(f) Ventilation system 
(i) There shall be provided an effective power ventilation system for the special category spaces sufficient to give at least 10 air changes per hour. The system for such spaces shall be entirely separated from other ventilation systems and shall be operating at all times when vehicles are in such spaces. The Administration may require an increased number of air changes when vehicles are being loaded and unloaded. 
(ii) The ventilation shall be such as to prevent air stratification and the formation of air pockets. 
(iii) Means shall be provided to indicate on the navigating bridge any loss or reduction of the required ventilating capacity. 
Additional provisions applicable only to special category spaces above the bulkhead deck 
(g) Scuppers 
In view of the serious loss of stability which could arise due to large quantities of water accumulating on the deck or decks consequent on the operation of the fixed pressure water-spraying system, scuppers shall be fitted so as to ensure that such water is rapidly discharged directly overboard. 
(h) Precautions against ignition of inflammable vapours 
(i) Equipment which may constitute a source of ignition of inflammable vapours and in particular electrical equipment and wiring, shall be installed at least 450 millimetres (18 inches) above the deck, provided that if the Administration is satisfied that the installation of such electrical equipment and wiring below this level is necessary for the safe operation of the ship, such electrical equipment and wiring shall be of a type approved for use in an explosive petrol and air mixture. Electrical equipment installed at more than 450 millimetres (18 inches) above the deck shall be of a type so enclosed and protected as to prevent the escape of sparks. The reference to a level of 450 millimetres (18 inches) above the deck shall be construed to mean each deck on which vehicles are carried and on which explosive vapours might be expected to accumulate. 
(ii) Electrical equipment and wiring, if installed in an exhaust ventilation duct, shall be of a type approved for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures and the outlet from any exhaust duct shall be sited in a safe position, having regard to other possible sources of ignition. 
Additional provisions applicable only to special category spaces below the bulkhead deck 
(i) Bilge pumping and drainage 
In view of the serious loss of stability which could arise due to large quantities of water accumulating on the deck or tank top consequent on the operation of the fixed pressure water-spraying system, the Administration may require pumping and drainage facilities to be provided additional to the requirements of Regulation 18 of Chapter II-1 of the present Convention. 
(j) Precautions against ignition of inflammable vapours 
(i) Electrical equipment and wiring, if fitted, shall be of a type suitable for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures. Other equipment which may constitute a source of ignition of inflammable vapours shall not be permitted. 
(ii) Electrical equipment and wiring, if installed in an exhaust ventilation duct, shall be of a type approved for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures and the outlet from any exhaust duct shall be sited in a safe position, having regard to other possible sources of ignition. 

Regulation 31 
Protection of cargo spaces other than special category spaces intended for the carriage of motor vehicles with fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion 
In any cargo space (other than special category spaces) containing motor vehicles with fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion, the following provisions shall be complied with: 
(a) Fire detection 
There shall be provided an approved fire detection and fire alarm system. 
(b) Fire-extinguishing arrangements 
(i) There shall be fitted a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system which shall comply with the provisions of Regulation 8 of this Chapter, except that if a carbon dioxide system is fitted, the quantity of gas available shall be at least sufficient to give a minimum volume of free gas equal to 45 per cent of the gross volume of the largest of such cargo spaces which is capable of being sealed, and the arrangements shall be such as to ensure that the gas is introduced rapidly and effectively into the space. Any other fixed gas fire-extinguishing system or fixed high expansion froth fire-extinguishing system may be fitted provided it gives equivalent protection. 
(ii) There shall be provided for use in any such space such number of portable fire extinguishers of an approved type as the Administration may deem sufficient. 
(c) Ventilation system 
(i) In any such cargo space there shall be provided an effective power ventilation system sufficient to give at least 10 air changes per hour. The system for such cargo spaces shall be entirely separated from other ventilation systems and shall be operating at all times when vehicles are in such spaces. 
(ii) The ventilation shall be such as to prevent air stratification and the formation of air pockets. 
(iii) Means shall be provided to indicate on the navigating bridge any loss or reduction of the required ventilating capacity. 
(d) Precautions against ignition of inflammable vapours 
(i) Electrical equipment and wiring, if fitted, shall be of a type suitable for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures. Other equipment which may constitute a source of ignition of inflammable vapours shall not be permitted. 
(ii) Electrical equipment and wiring, if installed in an exhaust ventilation duct, shall be of a type approved for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures and the outlet from any exhaust duct shall be sited in a safe position, having regard to other possible sources of ignition. 

Regulation 32 
Maintenance of fire patrols, etc., and provision for fire-extinguishing equipment 
(a) Fire patrols and detection, alarms and public address systems 
(i) An efficient patrol system shall be maintained so that an outbreak of fire may be promptly detected. Each member of the fire patrol shall be trained to be familiar with the arrangements of the ship as well as the location and operation of any equipment he may be called upon to use. 
(ii) Manual alarms shall be fitted throughout the accommodation and service spaces to enable the fire patrol to give an alarm immediately to the navigating bridge or main fire control station. 
(iii) An approved fire alarm or fire detecting system shall be provided which will automatically indicate at one or more suitable points or stations the presence or indication of fire and its location in any cargo space which, in the opinion of the Administration, is not accessible to the patrol system, except where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that the ship is engaged on voyages of such short duration that it would be unreasonable to apply this requirement. 
(iv) The ship shall at all times when at sea, or in port (except when out of service), be so manned or equipped as to ensure that any initial fire alarm is immediately received by a responsible member of the crew. 
(v) A special alarm, operated from the navigating bridge of fire control station, shall be fitted to summon the crew. This alarm may be part of the ship's general alarm system but it shall be capable of being sounded independently of the alarm to the passenger spaces. 
(vi) A public address system or other effective means of communication shall be available throughout the accommodation and service spaces and control stations. 
(b) Fire pumps and fire main system 
The ship shall be provided with fire pumps, fire main system, hydrants and hoses complying with the provisions of Regulation 5 of this Chapter and shall comply with the following requirements:

Regulation 2 
Definitions 
For the purpose of this Chapter: 
(a) "Short international voyage" means an international voyage in the course of which a ship is not more than 200 miles from a port or place in which the passengers and crew could be placed in safety, and which does not exceed 600 miles in length between the last port of call in the country in which the voyage begins and the final port of destination. 
(b) "Liferaft" means a liferaft complying with either Regulation 15 or Regulation 16 of this Chapter.

(e) "Buoyant apparatus" means flotation equipment (other than lifeboats, liferafts, lifebuoys and life-jackets) designed to support a specified number of persons who are in the water and of such construction that it retains its shape and properties. 

Regulation 3 
Exemptions 
(a) The Administration, if it considers that the sheltered nature and conditions of the voyage are such as to render the application of the full requirements of this Chapter unreasonable or unnecessary, may to that extent exempt from the requirements of this Chapter individual ships or classes of ships which, in the course of their voyage, do not go more than 20 miles from the nearest land. 
(b) In the case of passenger ships which are employed in special trades for the carriage of large numbers of special trade passengers, such as the pilgrim trade, the Administration, if satisfied that it is impracticable to enforce compliance with the requirements of this Chapter, may exempt such ships, when they belong to its country, from those requirements, provided that they comply fully with the provisions of: 
(i) the Rules annexed to the Special Trade Passenger Ships Agreement, 1971; and 
(ii) the Rules annexed to the Protocol on Space Requirements for Special Trade Passenger Ships, 1973, when it enters into force. 

Regulation 4 
Ready availability of lifeboats, liferafts and buoyant apparatus 
(a) The general principle governing the provision of lifeboats, liferafts and buoyant apparatus in a ship to which this Chapter applies is that they shall be readily available in case of emergency. 
(b) To be readily available, the lifeboats, liferafts and buoyant apparatus shall comply with the following conditions: 
(i) they shall be capable of being put into the water safely and rapidly even under unfavourable conditions of trim and of 15 degree of list; 
(ii) it shall be possible to effect embarkation into the lifeboats and liferafts rapidly and in good order; 
(iii) the arrangement of each lifeboat, liferaft and article of buoyant apparatus shall be such that it will not interfere with the operation of other boats, liferafts and buoyant apparatus. 
(c) All the life-saving appliances shall be kept in working order and available for immediate use before the ship leaves port and at all times during the voyage. 

Regulation 5 
Construction of lifeboats 
(a) All lifeboats shall be properly constructed and shall be of such form and proportions that they shall have ample stability in a seaway, and sufficient freeboard when loaded with their full complement of persons and equipment. All lifeboats shall be capable of maintaining positive stability when open to the sea and loaded with their full complement of persons and equipment. 
(b) (i) All lifeboats shall have rigid sides and internal buoyancy only. The Administration may approve lifeboats with a rigid shelter, provided that it may be readily opened from both inside and outside, and does not impede rapid embarkation and disembarkation or the launching and handling of the lifeboat. 
(ii) Motor lifeboats may be fitted to the satisfaction of the Administration with a means for preventing the entry of water at the fore end. 
(iii) All lifeboats shall be not less than 7.3 metres (24 feet) in length except where owing to the size of the ship, or for other reasons, the Administration considers the carriage of such lifeboats unreasonable or impracticable. In no ship shall the lifeboats be less than 4.9 metres (16 feet) in length. 
(c) No lifeboat may be approved the weight of which when fully laden with persons and equipment exceeds 20,300 kilogrammes (20 tons) or which has a carrying capacity calculated in accordance with Regulation 7 of this Chapter of more than 150 persons. 
(d) All lifeboats permitted to carry more than 60 persons but not more than 100 persons shall be either motor lifeboats complying with the requirements of Regulation 9 of this Chapter or be lifeboats fitted with an approved means of mechanical propulsion complying with Regulation 10 of this Chapter. All lifeboats permitted to carry more than 100 persons shall be motor lifeboats complying with the requirements of Regulation 9 of this Chapter. 
(e) All lifeboats shall be of sufficient strength to enable them to be safely lowered into the water when loaded with their full complement of persons and equipment. All lifeboats shall be of such strength that they will not suffer residual deflection if subjected to an overload of 25 per cent. 
(f) All lifeboats shall have a mean sheer at least equal to 4 per cent of their length. The sheer shall be approximately parabolic in form. 
(g) In lifeboats permitted to carry 100 or more persons the volume of the buoyancy shall be increased to the satisfaction of the Administration. 
(h) All lifeboats shall have inherent buoyancy, or shall be fitted with watertight air cases or other equivalent non-corrodible buoyant material which shall not be adversely affected by oil or oil products, sufficient to float the boat and its equipment when the boat is flooded and open to the sea. An additional volume of watertight air cases or other equivalent non-corrodible buoyant material, which shall not be adversely affected by oil or oil products, equal to at least one-tenth of the cubic capacity of the boat shall also be provided. The Administration may permit the watertight air cases to be filled with a non-corrodible buoyant material which shall not be adversely affected by oil or oil products. 
(i) All thwarts and side-seats shall be fitted as low in the lifeboat as practicable. 
(j) The block coefficient of the cubic capacity as determined in accordance with Regulation 6 of this Chapter of all lifeboats, except wooden lifeboats made of planks, shall be not less than 0.64 provided that any such lifeboat may have a block coefficient of less than 0.64 if the Administration is satisfied with the sufficiency of the metacentric height and freeboard when the lifeboat is loaded with its full complement of persons and equipment. 

Regulation 6 
Cubic capacity of lifeboats 
(a) The cubic capacity of a lifeboat shall be determined by Simpson's (Stirling's) Rule or by any other method giving the same degree of accuracy. The capacity of a square-sterned lifeboat shall be calculated as if the lifeboat had a pointed stern. 
(b) For example, the capacity in cubic metres (or cubic feet) of a lifeboat, calculated by the aid of Simpson's Rule, may be considered as given by the following formula: 
Capacity = 
L being the length of the lifeboat in metres (or feet) from the inside of the planking or plating at the stem to the corresponding point at the stern post: in the case of a lifeboat with a square stern, the length is measured to the inside of the transom. 
A, B, C denote respectively the areas of the cross-sections at the quarter-length forward, amidships, and the quarter-length aft, which correspond to the three points obtained by dividing L into four equal parts. (The areas corresponding to the two ends of the lifeboat are considered negligible.) 
The areas A, B, C shall be deemed to be given in square metres (or square feet) by the successive application of the following formula to each of the three cross-sections: 
Area = h (a + 4b + 2c + 4d + e) 
12 
h being the depth measured in metres (or in feet) inside the planking or plating from the keel to the level of the gunwale, or, in certain cases, to a lower level as determined hereafter. 
a, b, c, d, e denote the horizontal breadths of the lifeboat measured in metres (or in feet) at the upper and lower points of the depth and at the three points obtained by dividing h into four equal parts (a and e being the breadths at the extreme point, and c at the middle point of h). 
(c) If the sheer of the gunwale, measured at the two points situated at a quarter of the length of the lifeboat from the ends, exceeds 1 per cent of the length of the lifeboat the depth employed in calculating the area of the cross-sections A or C shall be deemed to be the depth amidships plus I per cent of the length of the lifeboat. 
(d) If the depth of the lifeboat amidships exceeds 45 per cent of the breadth, the depth employed in calculating the area of the amidship cross-section B shall be deemed to be equal to 45 per cent of the breadth, and the depth employed in calculating the areas of the quarter-length sections A and C is obtained by increasing this last figure by an amount equal to 1 per cent of the length of the lifeboat, provided that in no case shall the depths employed in the calculation exceed the actual depths at these points. 
(e) If the depth of the lifeboat is greater than 1.22 metres (4 feet) the number of persons given by the application of this Rule shall be reduced in proportion to the ratio of 1.22 metres (4 feet) to the actual depth, until the lifeboat has been satisfactorily tested afloat with that number of persons on board, all wearing life-jackets. 
(f) The Administration shall impose, by suitable formulae, a limit for the number of persons allowed in lifeboats with very fine ends and in lifeboats very full in form. 
(g) The Administration may assign to a lifeboat constructed of wooden planks capacity equal to the product of the length, the breadth and the depth multiplied by 0.6 if it is evident that this formula does not give a greater capacity than that obtained by the above method. The dimensions shall then be measured in the following manner: 
Length - From the intersection of the outside of the planking with the stem to the corresponding point at the stern post or, in the case of a square-sterned boat, to the after side of the transom. 
Breadth - From the outside of the planking at the point where the breadth of the boat is greatest. 
Depth - Amidships inside the planking from the keel to the level of the gunwale, but the depth used in calculating the cubic capacity may not in any case exceed 45 per cent of the breadth. 
In all cases the shipowner has the right to require that the cubic capacity of the lifeboat shall be determined by exact measurement. 
(h) The cubic capacity of a motor lifeboat or a lifeboat fitted with other propelling gear shall be obtained from the gross capacity by deducting a volume equal to that occupied by the motor and its accessories or the gearbox of the other propelling gear, and, when carried, the radiotelegraph installation and searchlight with their accessories. 

Regulation 7 
Carrying capacity of lifeboats 
The number of persons which a lifeboat shall be permitted to accommodate shall be equal to the greatest whole number obtained by dividing the capacity in cubic metres by: 
In the case of a lifeboat of 7.3 metres (24 feet) in length or over 
0.283 (or where the capacity is 


measured in cubic feet 10); 





in the case of lifeboats of 4.9 metres (16 feet) in length 

0.396 (or where the capacity is 


measured in cubic feet 14); and 





in the case of lifeboats of 4.9 metres (16 feet) in length or over but under 7.3 metres (24 feet) 

a number between 0.396 and 0.283 (or 


where the capacity is measured in cubic feet between 14 and 10) to be obtained by interpolation; 

provided that the number shall in no case exceed the number of adult persons wearing life-jackets which can be seated without in any way interfering with the use of oars or the operation of other propulsion equipment. 

Regulation 8 
Number of motor lifeboats to be carried 
(a) In every passenger ship there shall be carried on each side of the ship at least one motor lifeboat complying with the requirements of Regulation 9 of this Chapter.

(2) In the case of any other motor lifeboat, at least four knots. 
(b) The volume of the internal buoyancy appliances of a motor lifeboat shall be increased above that required by Regulation 5 of this Chapter by the amount, if any, by which the volume of the internal buoyancy appliances required to support the engine and its accessories, and, if fitted, the searchlight and radiotelegraph installation and their accessories, exceeds the volume of the internal buoyancy appliances required, at the rate of 0.0283 cubic metres (one cubic foot) per person, to support the additional persons which the lifeboat could accommodate if the motor and its accessories, and, if fitted, the searchlight and radiotelegraph installation and their accessories, were removed. 

Regulation 10 
Specification of mechanically propelled lifeboats other than motor lifeboats 
A mechanically propelled lifeboat, other than a motor lifeboat, shall comply with the following conditions: 
(a) The propelling gear shall be of an approved type and shall have sufficient power to enable the lifeboat to be readily cleared from the ship's side when launched and be able to hold course under adverse weather conditions. If the gear is manually operated it shall be capable of being worked by persons untrained in its use and shall be capable of being operated when the lifeboat is flooded. 
(b) A device shall be fitted by means of which the helmsman can cause the lifeboat to go astern at any time when the propelling gear is in operation. 
(c) The volume of the internal buoyancy of a mechanically propelled lifeboat, other than a motor lifeboat, shall be increased to compensate for the weight of the propelling gear.

(b) Passenger ships engaged on international voyages which are not short international voyages shall carry: 
(i) Lifeboats on each side of such aggregate capacity as will accommodate half the total number of persons on board. Provided that the Administration may permit the substitution of lifeboats by liferafts of the same total capacity so however that there shall never be less than sufficient lifeboats on each side of the ship to accommodate 371/2 per cent of all on board. 
(ii) Liferafts of sufficient aggregate capacity to accommodate 25 per cent of the total number of persons on board, together with buoyant apparatus for 3 per cent of that number. Provided that ships which have a factor of subdivision of 0.33 or less shall be permitted to carry, in lieu of liferafts for 25 per cent of all on board and buoyant apparatus for 3 per cent of all on board, buoyant apparatus for 25 per cent of that number. 
(c) (i) A passenger ship engaged on short international voyages shall be provided with sets of davits in accordance with its length as specified in Column A of the Table in Regulation 28 of this Chapter. Each set of davits shall have a lifeboat attached to it and these lifeboats shall provide at least the minimum capacity required by Column C of the Table or the capacity required to provide accommodation for all on board if this is less. 
Provided that when in the opinion of the Administration it is impracticable or unreasonable to place on a ship engaged on short international voyages the number of sets of davits required by Column A of the Table in Regulation 28, the Administration may authorize, under exceptional conditions, a smaller number of davits, except that this number shall never be less than the minimum number fixed by Column B of the Table, and that the total capacity of the lifeboats on the ship will be at least equal to the minimum capacity required by Column C or the capacity required to provide for all persons on board if this is less. 
(ii) If the lifeboats so provided are not sufficient to accommodate all on board, additional lifeboats under davits or liferafts shall be provided so that the accommodation provided in the lifeboats and the liferafts in the ship shall be sufficient for all on board. 
(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph in any ship engaged on short international voyages the number of persons carried shall not exceed the total capacity of the lifeboats provided in accordance with sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph unless the Administration considers that this is necessitated by the volume of traffic and then only if the ship complies with the provisions of paragraph (d) of Regulation I of Chapter II-1. 
(iv) Where under the provisions of sub-paragraph (iii) of this paragraph the Administration has permitted the carriage of persons in excess of the lifeboat capacity and is satisfied that it is impracticable in that ship to stow the liferafts carried in accordance with sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph it may permit a reduction in the number of lifeboats. 
Provided that: 
(1) the number of lifeboats shall, in the case of ships of 58 metres (190 feet) in length and over, never be less than four, two of which shall be carried on each side of the ship, and in the case of ships of less than 58 metres (190 feet) in length, shall never be less than two, one of which shall be carried on each side of the ship; and 
(2) the number of lifeboats and liferafts shall always be sufficient to accommodate the total number of persons on board. 
(v) Every passenger ship engaged on short international voyages shall carry in addition to the lifeboats and liferafts required by the provisions of this paragraph, liferafts sufficient to accommodate 10 per cent of the total number of persons for whom there is accommodation in the lifeboats carried in that ship. 
(vi) Every passenger ship engaged on short international voyages shall also carry buoyant apparatus for at least 5 per cent of the total number of persons on board. 
(vii) The Administration may permit individual ships or classes of ships with short international voyage certificates to proceed on voyages in excess of 600 miles but not exceeding 1,200 miles if such ships comply with the provisions of paragraph (d) of Regulation 1 of Chapter II-l, if they carry lifeboats which provide for 75 per cent of the persons on board and otherwise comply with the provisions of this paragraph.

Note on (C): Where the length of the ship is under 31 metres (100 feet) or over 168 metres (550 feet) the minimum number of sets of davits and the cubic capacity of the lifeboats shall be prescribed by the Administration. 

Regulation 29 
Stowage and handling of lifeboats, liferafts and buoyant apparatus 
(a) Lifeboats and liferafts shall be stowed to the satisfaction of the Administration in such a way that: 
(i) they can all be launched in the shortest possible time and in not more than 30 minutes; 
(ii) they will not impede in any way the prompt handling of any of the other lifeboats, liferafts or buoyant apparatus or the marshalling of the persons on board at the launching stations, or their embarkation; 
(iii) the lifeboats, and the liferafts for which approved launching devices are required to be carried, shall be capable of being put into the water loaded with their full complement of persons and equipment even in unfavourable conditions of trim and of 15 degrees of list either way; and 
(iv) the liferafts for which approved launching devices are not required to be carried, and the buoyant apparatus, shall be capable of being put into the water even in unfavourable conditions of trim and of 15 degrees of list either way. 
(b) Every lifeboat shall be attached to a separate set of davits. 
(c) Lifeboats may only be stowed on more than one deck if proper measures are taken to prevent lifeboats on a lower deck being fouled by those stowed on a deck above. 
(d) Lifeboats, and liferafts for which approved launching devices are required to be carried, shall not be placed in the bow of the ship. They shall be stowed in such positions as to ensure safe launching having particular regard to clearance from the propeller and steeply overhanging portions of the hull aft. 
(e) Davits shall be of approved design and shall be suitably placed to the satisfaction of the Administration. They shall be so disposed on one or more decks that the lifeboats placed under them can be safely lowered without interference from the operation of any other davits. 
(f) Davits shall be as follows: 
(i) luffing or gravity type for operating lifeboats weighing not more than 2,300 kilogrammes (21/4 tons) in their turning out condition; 
(ii) gravity type for operating lifeboats weighing more than 2,300 kilogrammes (21/4 tons) in their turning out condition. 
(g) Davits, falls, blocks and all other gear shall be of such strength that the lifeboats can be turned out manned by a launching crew and then safely lowered with the full complement of persons and equipment, with the ship listed to 15 degrees either way and with a 10 degrees trim. 
(h) Skates or other suitable means shall be provided to facilitate launching the lifeboats against a list of 15 degrees. 
(i) Means shall be provided for bringing the lifeboats against the ship's side and there holding them so that persons may be safely embarked. 
(j) Lifeboats, together with the emergency boats required by Regulation 27 of this Chapter, shall be served by wire rope falls, together with winches of an approved type which, in the case of the emergency boats, shall be capable of quick recovery of those boats. Exceptionally, the Administration may allow manila rope falls or falls of another approved material with or without winches (except that the emergency boats shall be required to be served by winches which are capable of quick recovery of those boats) where they are satisfied that manila rope falls or falls of another approved material are adequate. 
(k) At least two lifelines shall be fitted to the davit span, and the falls and lifelines shall be long enough to reach the water with the ship at its lightest seagoing draught and listed to 15 degrees either way. Lower fall blocks shall be fitted with a suitable ring or long link for attaching to the sling hooks unless an approved type of disengaging gear is fitted. 
(l) Where mechanically-powered appliances are fitted for the recovery of the lifeboats, efficient hand gear shall also be provided. Where davits are recovered by action of the falls by power, safety devices shall be fitted which will automatically cut off the power before the davits come against the stops in order to avoid overstressing the wire rope falls or davits. 
(m) Lifeboats attached to davits shall have the falls ready for service and arrangements shall be made for speedily, but not necessarily simultaneously, detaching the lifeboats from the falls. The point of attachment of the lifeboats to the falls shall be at such height above the gunwale as to ensure stability when lowering the lifeboats. 
(n) (i) In passenger ships engaged on international voyages which are not short international voyages in which there are carried lifeboats and liferafts in accordance with sub-paragraph (b)(i) of Regulation 27 of this Chapter, there shall be provided approved launching devices sufficient in number in the opinion of the Administration to enable that number of liferafts which, together with the lifeboats, is required in accordance with that sub-paragraph to provide accommodation for all on board, to be put into the water loaded with the number of persons they are permitted to accommodate, in not more than thirty minutes in calm conditions. Approved launching devices so provided shall, so far as practicable, be distributed equally on each side of the ship and there shall never be less than one such device on each side. No such devices need, however, be provided for the additional liferafts required to be carried by sub-paragraph (b)(ii) of Regulation 27 of this Chapter for 25 per cent of all on board, but every liferaft carried in accordance with that sub-paragraph shall, where an approved launching device is provided in the ship, be of a type which is capable of being launched from such a device. 
(ii) In passenger ships engaged on short international voyages, the number of approved launching devices to be provided shall be at the discretion of the Administration. The number of liferafts allocated to each such device carried shall not be more than the number which, in the opinion of the Administration, can be put into the water fully loaded with the number of persons they are permitted to carry by that device in not more than 30 minutes in calm conditions. 

Regulation 30 
Lighting for decks, lifeboats, liferafts, etc. 
(a) Provision shall be made for an electric or equivalent system of lighting sufficient for all the requirements of safety in the different parts of a passenger ship, and particularly for decks on which the lifeboats and liferafts are stowed. The self-contained emergency source of electrical power required by Regulation 25 of Chapter II-1 shall be capable of supplying where necessary this lighting system and also the lighting required by sub-paragraphs (a)(ii), (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) of Regulation 19 of this Chapter. 
(b) The exit from every main compartment occupied by passengers or crew shall be continuously lighted by an emergency lamp. The power for these emergency lamps shall be so arranged that they will be supplied from the emergency source of power referred to in paragraph (a) of this Regulation in the event of failure of the main generating plant. 

Regulation 31 
Manning of lifeboats and liferafts 
(a) A deck officer or certified lifeboatman shall be placed in charge of each lifeboat and a second-in-command shall also be nominated. The person in charge shall have a list of the lifeboat's crew, and shall see that the men placed under his orders are acquainted with their several duties. 
(b) A man capable of working the motor shall be assigned to each motor lifeboat. 
(c) A man capable of working the radio and searchlight installations shall be assigned to each lifeboat carrying this equipment. 
(d) A man practised in the handling and operation of liferafts shall be assigned to each liferaft carried, except where in ships engaged on short international voyages the Administration is satisfied that this is not practicable. 

Regulation 32 
Certificated lifeboatmen 
(a) In passenger ships there shall be, for every lifeboat carried in order to comply with this Chapter, a number of lifeboatmen at least equal to that specified in the following table: 
Prescribed complement of lifeboat

PART C - CARGO SHIPS ONLY 

Regulation 35 
Number and capacity of lifeboats and liferafts 
(a) (i) Every cargo ship, except ships employed as whale factory ships, fish processing or canning factory ships, and ships engaged in the carriage of persons employed in the whaling, fish processing or canning industries, shall carry lifeboats on each side of the ship of such aggregate capacity as will accommodate all persons on board, and in addition shall carry liferafts sufficient to accommodate half that number. 
Provided that, in the case of such cargo ships engaged on international voyages between near neighbouring countries, the Administration, if it is satisfied that the conditions of the voyage are such as to render the compulsory carriage of liferafts unreasonable or unnecessary, may to that extent exempt individual ships or classes of ships from this requirement. 
(ii) (1) Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (ii)(2) of this paragraph, every tanker of 3,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall carry not less than four lifeboats, two of which shall be carried aft and two amidships, except that in tankers which have no amidships superstructure all lifeboats shall be carried aft. 
(2) A tanker of 3,000 tons gross tonnage and upwards which has no amidships superstructure may be permitted by the Administration to carry two lifeboats only, provided that: 
(aa) one lifeboat is carried aft on each side of the ship; 
(bb) each such lifeboat shall not exceed 8.5 metres (28 feet) in length; 
(cc) each such lifeboat shall be stowed as far forward as practicable, but at least so far forward that the after end of the lifeboat is one-and-a-half times the length of the lifeboat forward of the propeller; and 
(dd) each such lifeboat shall be stowed as near sea level as is safe and practicable. 
(b) (i) Every ship employed as a whale factory ship, every ship employed as a fish processing or canning factory ship and every ship engaged in the carriage of persons employed in the whaling, fish processing or canning industries shall carry: 
(1) Lifeboats on each side of such aggregate capacity as will accommodate half the total number of persons on board; provided that the Administration may permit the substitution of lifeboats by liferafts of the same total capacity so however that there shall never be less than sufficient lifeboats on each side of the ship to accommodate 371/2 per cent of all on board. 
(2) Liferafts of sufficient aggregate capacity to accommodate half the total number of persons on board; provided that, if in ships employed as fish processing or canning factory ships, it is impracticable to carry lifeboats which comply fully with the requirements of this Chapter, the Administration may permit instead the carriage of other boats, which shall however provide not less than the accommodation required by this Regulation and shall have at least the buoyancy and equipment required by this Chapter for lifeboats. 
(ii) Every ship employed as a whale factory ship, every ship employed as a fish processing or canning factory ship and every ship engaged in the carriage of persons employed in the whaling, fish processing or canning industries shall carry two boats - one on each side - for use in an emergency. These boats shall be of an approved type and shall be not more than 8.5 metres (28 feet) in length. They may be counted for the purposes of this paragraph provided that they comply fully with the requirements for lifeboats of this Chapter and for the purposes of Regulation 8 provided that in addition they comply with the requirements of Regulation 9, and, where appropriate, Regulation 14 of this Chapter. They shall be kept ready for immediate use while the ship is at sea. In ships in which the requirements of paragraph (g) of Regulation 36 of this Chapter are met by means of appliances fitted to the sides of the lifeboats, such appliances shall not be required to be fitted to the two boats provided to meet the requirements of this Regulation. 
(c) Every cargo ship with no amidships superstructure having a registered length of 150 metres (492 feet) and upwards shall carry, in addition to the liferafts required under sub-paragraph (a)(i) of this Regulation, a liferaft capable of accommodating at least six persons which shall be stowed as far forward as is reasonable and practicable. 

Regulation 36 
Davits and launching arrangements 
(a) In cargo ships lifeboats and liferafts shall be stowed to the satisfaction of the Administration. 
(b) Every lifeboat shall be attached to a separate set of davits. 
(c) Lifeboats and liferafts for which approved launching devices are required to be carried shall preferably be positioned as close to accommodation and service spaces as possible. They shall be stowed in such positions as to ensure safe launching, having particular regard to clearance from the propeller and steeply overhanging portions of the hull, with the object of ensuring so far as practicable that they can be launched down the straight side of the ship. If positioned forward they shall be stowed abaft the collision bulkhead in a sheltered position and in this respect the Administration shall give special consideration to the strength of the davits. 
(d) Davits shall be of approved design and shall be suitably placed to the satisfaction of the Administration. 
(e) In tankers of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards, ships employed as whale factory ships, ships employed as fish processing or canning factory ships and ships engaged in the carriage of persons employed in the whaling, fish processing or canning industries, all davits shall be of the gravity type. In other ships, davits shall be as follows: 
(i) luffing or gravity type for operating lifeboats weighing not more than 2,300 kilogrammes (21/4 tons) in their turning out condition; 
(ii) gravity type for operating lifeboats weighing more than 2,300 kilogrammes (21/4 tons) in their turning out condition. 
(f) Davits, falls, blocks and all other gear shall be of such strength that the lifeboats can be turned out manned by a launching crew and then safely lowered with the full complement of persons and equipment, with the ship listed to 15 degrees either way, and with a 10 degrees trim. 
(g) Skates or other suitable means shall be provided to facilitate launching the lifeboats against a list of 15 degrees. 
(h) Means shall be provided for bringing the lifeboats against the ship' s side and there holding them so that persons may be safely embarked. 
(i) Lifeboats, together with the emergency boats required by sub-paragraph (b)(ii) of Regulation 35 of this Chapter, shall be served by wire rope falls, together with winches of an approved type which, in the case of the emergency boats, shall be capable of quick recovery of those boats. Exceptionally, the Administration may allow manila rope falls or falls of another approved material with or without winches (except that the emergency boats shall be required to be served by winches which are capable of quick recovery of those boats) where they are satisfied that manila rope falls or falls of another approved material are adequate. 
(j) At least two lifelines shall be fitted to the davit spans, and the falls and lifelines shall be long enough to reach the water with the ship at its lightest sea-going draught and listed to 15 degrees either way. Lower fall blocks shall be fitted with a suitable ring or long link for attaching to the sling hooks unless an approved type of disengaging gear is fitted. 
(k) Where mechanically powered appliances are fitted for the recovery of the lifeboats, efficient hand gear shall also be provided. Where davits are recovered by action of the falls by power, safety devices shall be fitted which will automatically cut off the power before the davits come against the stops in order to avoid overstressing the wire rope falls or davits. 
(l) Lifeboats shall have the falls ready for service, and arrangements shall be made for speedily, but not necessarily simultaneously, detaching the lifeboats from the falls. The point of attachment of the lifeboats to the falls shall be at such height above the gunwale as to ensure stability when lowering the lifeboats. 
(m) In ships employed as whale factory ships, ships employed as fish processing or canning factory ships and ships engaged in the carriage of persons employed in the whaling, fish processing or canning industries, in which there are carried lifeboats and liferafts in accordance with sub-paragraph (b)(i)(2) of Regulation 35 no approved launching devices need be provided for the liferafts, but there shall be provided such devices sufficient in number, in the opinion of the Administration, to enable the liferafts carried in accordance with sub-paragraph (b)(i)(1) of that Regulation to be put into the water loaded with the number of persons they are permitted to accommodate, in not more than 30 minutes in calm conditions. Approved launching devices so provided shall, so far as practicable, be distributed equally on each side of the ship. Every liferaft carried on ships in which an approved launching device is required to be provided shall be of a type which is capable of being launched by such a device. 

Regulation 37 
Number of lifebuoys to be provided 
At least eight lifebuoys of a type which satisfies the requirements of Regulation 21 of this Chapter shall be carried. 

Regulation 38 
Emergency lighting 
The lighting required by sub-paragraphs (a)(ii), (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) of Regulation 19 of this Chapter shall be capable of being supplied for at least three hours by the emergency source of power required by Regulation 26 of Chapter II-1. In cargo ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards the Administration shall ensure that the lighting of the alleyways, stairways and exits is such that the access of all persons on board to the launching stations and stowage positions of lifeboats and liferafts is not impeded. 

CHAPTER IV

(c) No provision in this Chapter shall prevent the use by a ship or survival craft in distress of any means at its disposal to attract attention, make known its position and obtain help. 

Regulation 2 
Terms and definitions 
For the purpose of this Chapter the following terms shall have the meanings defined below. All other terms which are used in this Chapter and which are also defined in the Radio Regulations shall have the same meanings as defined in those Regulations: 
(a) "Radio Regulations" means the Radio Regulations annexed to, or regarded as being annexed to, the most recent International Telecommunication Convention which may be in force at any time. 
(b) "Radiotelegraph auto alarm" means an automatic alarm receiving apparatus which responds to the radiotelegraph alarm signal and has been approved. 
(c) "Radiotelephone auto alarm" means an automatic alarm receiving apparatus which responds to the radiotelephone alarm signal and has been approved. 
(d) "Radiotelephone station", "Radiotelephone installation" and "Watches - radiotelephone" shall be considered as relating to the medium frequency band, unless expressly provided otherwise. 
(e) "Radio Officer" means a person holding at least a first or second class radiotelegraph operator's certificate, or a radiocommunication operator's general certificate for the maritime mobile service, complying with the provisions of the Radio Regulations, who is employed in the radiotelegraph station of a ship which is provided with such a station in compliance with the provisions of Regulation 3 or Regulation 4 of this Chapter. 
(f) "Radiotelephone operator" means a person holding an appropriate certificate complying with the provisions of the Radio Regulations. 
(g) "Existing installation" means: 
(i) an installation wholly installed on board a ship before the date on which the present Convention enters into force irrespective of the date on which acceptance by the respective Administration takes effect; and 
(ii) an installation part of which was installed on board a ship before the date of entry into force of the present Convention and the rest of which consists either of parts installed in replacement of identical parts, or parts which comply with the requirements of this Chapter. 
(h) "New installation" means any installation which is not an existing installation. 

Regulation 3 
Radiotelegraph station 
Passenger ships irrespective of size and cargo ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards, unless exempted under Regulation 5 of this Chapter, shall be fitted with a radiotelegraph station complying with the provisions of Regulations 9 and 10 of this Chapter. 

Regulation 4 
Radiotelephone station 
Cargo ships of 300 tons gross tonnage and upwards but less than 1,600 tons gross tonnage, unless fitted with a radiotelegraph station complying with the provisions of Regulations 9 and 10 of this Chapter shall, provided they are not exempted under Regulation 5 of this Chapter, be fitted with a radiotelephone station complying with the provisions of Regulations 15 and 16 of this Chapter. 

Regulation 5 
Exemptions from Regulations 3 and 4 
(a) The Contracting Governments consider it highly desirable not to deviate from the application of Regulations 3 and 4 of this Chapter; nevertheless the Administration may grant to individual passenger or cargo ships exemptions of a partial and/or conditional nature, or complete exemption from the requirements of Regulation 3 or Regulation 4 of this Chapter. 
(b) The exemptions permitted under paragraph (a) of this Regulation shall be granted only to a ship engaged on a voyage where the maximum distance of the ship from the shore, the length of the voyage, the absence of general navigational hazards, and other conditions affecting safety are such as to render the full application of Regulation 3 or Regulation 4 of this Chapter unreasonable or unnecessary. When deciding whether or not to grant exemptions to individual ships, Administrations shall have regard to the effect that exemptions may have upon the general efficiency of the distress service for the safety of all ships. Administrations should bear in mind the desirability of requiring ships which are exempted from the requirement of Regulation 3 of this Chapter to be fitted with a radiotelephone station which complies with the provisions of Regulations 15 and 16 of this Chapter as a condition of exemption. 
(c) Each Administration shall submit to the Organization as soon as possible after the first of January in each year a report showing all exemptions granted under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Regulation during the previous calendar year and giving the reasons for granting such exemptions.

CHAPTER V 
SAFETY OF NAVIGATION 

Regulation 1 
Application 
This Chapter, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Chapter, applies to all ships on all voyages, except ships of war and ships solely navigating the Great Lakes of North America and their connecting and tributary waters as far east as the lower exit of the St. Lambert Lock at Montreal in the Province of Quebec, Canada. 

Regulation 2 
Danger messages 
(a) The master of every ship which meets with dangerous ice, a dangerous derelict, or any other direct dangers to navigation, or a tropical storm, or encounters sub-freezing air temperatures associated with gale force winds causing severe ice accretion on superstructures, or winds of force 10 or above on the Beaufort scale for which no storm warning has been received, is bound to communicate the information by all the means at his disposal to ships in the vicinity, and also to the competent authorities at the first point on the coast with which he can communicate. The form in which the information is sent is not obligatory. It may be transmitted either in plain language (preferably English) or by means of the International Code of Signals. It should be broadcast to all ships in the vicinity and sent to the first point on the coast to which communication can be made, with a request that it be transmitted to the appropriate authorities. 
(b) Each Contracting Government will take all steps necessary to ensure that when intelligence of any of the dangers specified in paragraph (a) of this Regulation is received, it will be promptly brought to the knowledge of those concerned and communicated to other interested Governments. 
(c) The transmission of messages respecting the dangers specified is free of cost to the ships concerned. 
(d) All radio messages issued under paragraph (a) of this Regulation shall be preceded by the Safety Signal, using the procedure as prescribed by the Radio Regulations as defined in Regulation 2 of Chapter IV. 

Regulation 3 
Information required in danger messages 
The following information is required in danger messages: 
(a) Ice, derelicts and other direct dangers to navigation 
(i) The kind of ice, derelict or danger observed. 
(ii) The position of the ice, derelict or danger when last observed. 
(iii) The time and date (Greenwich Mean Time) when danger last observed. 
(b) Tropical storms (Hurricanes in the West Indies, Typhoons in the China Sea, Cyclones in Indian waters, and storms of a similar nature in other regions) 
(i) A statement that a tropical storm has been encountered. The obligation should be interpreted in a broad spirit, and information transmitted whenever the master has good reason to believe that a tropical storm is developing or exists in his neighbourhood. 
(ii) Time, date (Greenwich Mean Time) and position of ship when the observation was taken. 
(iii) As much of the following information as is practicable should be included in the message: 
- barometric pressure, preferably corrected (stating millibars, millimetres, or inches, and whether corrected or uncorrected); 
- barometric tendency (the change in barometric pressure during the past three hours); 
- true wind direction; 
- wind force (Beaufort scale); 
- state of the sea (smooth, moderate, rough, high); 
- swell (slight, moderate, heavy) and the true direction from which it comes. Period or length of swell (short, average, long) would also be of value; 
- true course and speed of ship. 
(c) Subsequent observations 
When a master has reported a tropical or other dangerous storm, it is desirable, but not obligatory, that further observations be made and transmitted hourly, if practicable, but in any case at intervals of not more than three hours, so long as the ship remains under the influence of the storm. 
(d) Winds of force 10 or above on the Beaufort scale for which no storm warning has been received 
This is intended to deal with storms other than the tropical storms referred to in paragraph (b) of this Regulation; when such a storm is encountered, the message should contain similar information to that listed under that paragraph but excluding the details concerning sea and swell. 
(e) Sub-freezing air temperatures associated with gale force winds causing severe ice accretion on superstructures 
(i) Time and date (Greenwich Mean Time).

Regulation 4 
Meteorological services 
(a) The Contracting Governments undertake to encourage the collection of meteorological data by ships at sea and to arrange for their examination, dissemination and exchange in the manner most suitable for the purpose of aiding navigation. Administrations shall encourage the use of instruments of a high degree of accuracy, and shall facilitate the checking of such instruments upon request. 
(b) In particular, the Contracting Governments undertake to co-operate in carrying out, as far as practicable, the following meteorological arrangements: 
(i) To warn ships of gales, storms and tropical storms, both by the issue of radio messages and by the display of appropriate signals at coastal points. 
(ii) To issue daily, by radio, weather bulletins suitable for shipping, containing data of existing weather, waves and ice, forecasts and, when practicable, sufficient additional information to enable simple weather charts to be prepared at sea and also to encourage the transmission of suitable facsimile weather charts. 
(iii) To prepare and issue such publications as may be necessary for the efficient conduct of meteorological work at sea and to arrange, if practicable, for the publication and making available of daily weather charts for the information of departing ships. 
(iv) To arrange for selected ships to be equipped with tested instruments (such as a barometer, a barograph, a psychrometer, and suitable apparatus for measuring sea temperature) for use in this service, and to take meteorological observations at main standard times for surface synoptic observations (at least four times daily, whenever circumstances permit) and to encourage other ships to take observations in a modified form, particularly when in areas where shipping is sparse; these ships to transmit their observations by radio for the benefit of the various official meteorological services, repeating the information for the benefit of ships in the vicinity. When in the vicinity of a tropical storm, or of a suspected tropical storm, ships should be encouraged to take and transmit their observations at more frequent intervals whenever practicable, bearing in mind navigational preoccupations of ships' officers during storm conditions. 
(v) To arrange for the reception and transmission by coast radio stations of weather messages from and to ships. Ships which are unable to communicate direct with shore shall be encouraged to relay their weather messages through ocean weather ships or through other ships which are in contact with shore. 
(vi) To encourage all masters to inform ships in the vicinity and also shore stations whenever they experience a wind speed of 50 knots or more (force 10 on the Beaufort scale). 
(vii) To endeavour to obtain a uniform procedure in regard to the international meteorological services already specified, and, as far as is practicable, to conform to the Technical Regulations and recommendations made by the World Meteorological Organization, to which the Contracting Governments may refer for study and advice any meteorological question which may arise in carrying out the present Convention. 
(c) The information provided for in this Regulation shall be furnished in form for transmission and transmitted in the order of priority prescribed by the Radio Regulations, and during transmission "to all stations" of meteorological information, forecasts and warnings, all ship stations must conform to the provisions of the Radio Regulations. 
(d) Forecasts, warnings, synoptic and other meteorological reports intended for ships shall be issued and disseminated by the national service in the best position to serve various zones and areas, in accordance with mutual arrangements made by the Contracting Governments concerned. 

Regulation 5 
Ice patrol service 
(a) The Contracting Governments undertake to continue an ice patrol and a service for study and observation of ice conditions in the North Atlantic. During the whole of the ice season the south-eastern, southern and south-western limits of the regions of icebergs in the vicinity of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland shall be guarded for the purpose of informing passing ships of the extent of this dangerous region; for the study of ice conditions in general; and for the purpose of affording assistance to ships and crews requiring aid within the limits of operation of the patrol ships. During the rest of the year the study and observation of ice conditions shall be maintained as advisable. 
(b) Ships and aircraft used for the ice patrol service and the study and observation of ice conditions may be assigned other duties by the managing Government, provided that such other duties do not interfere with their primary purpose or increase the cost of this service. 

Regulation 6 
Ice patrol. Management and cost 
(a) The Government of the United States of America agrees to continue the management of the ice patrol service and the study and observation of ice conditions, including the dissemination of information received therefrom. The Contracting Governments specially interested in these services undertake to contribute to the expense of maintaining and operating these services; each contribution to be based upon the total gross tonnage of the vessels of each contributing Government passing through the regions of icebergs guarded by the Ice Patrol; in particular, each Contracting Government specially interested undertakes to contribute annually to the expense of maintaining and operating these services a sum determined by the ratio which the total gross tonnage of that Contracting Government's vessels passing during the ice season through the regions of icebergs guarded by the Ice Patrol bears to the combined total gross tonnage of the vessels of all contributing Governments passing during the ice season through the regions of icebergs guarded by the Ice Patrol. Non-contracting Governments specially interested may contribute to the expense of maintaining and operating these services on the same basis. The managing Government will furnish annually to each contributing Government a statement of the total cost of maintaining and operating the Ice Patrol and the proportionate share of each contributing Government. 
(b) Each of the contributing Governments has the right to alter or discontinue its contribution, and other interested Governments may undertake to contribute to the expense. The contributing Government which avails itself of this right will continue responsible for its current contribution up to 1 September following the date of giving notice of intention to alter or discontinue its contribution. To take advantage of the said right it must give notice to the managing Government at least six months before the said 1 September. 
(c) If, at any time, the United States Government should desire to discontinue these services, or if one of the contributing Governments should express a wish to relinquish responsibility for its pecuniary contribution, or to have its contribution altered, or another Contracting Government should desire to undertake to contribute to the expense, the contributing Governments shall settle the question in accordance with their mutual interests. 
(d) The contributing Governments shall have the right by common consent to make from time to time such alterations in the provisions of this Regulation and of Regulation 5 of this Chapter as appear desirable. 
(e) Where this Regulation provides that a measure may be taken after agreement among the contributing Governments, proposals made by any Contracting Government for effecting such a measure shall be communicated to the managing Government which shall approach the other contributing Governments with a view to ascertaining whether they accept such proposals, and the results of the enquiries thus made shall be sent to the other contributing Governments and the Contracting Government making the proposals. In particular, the arrangements relating to contributions to the cost of the services shall be reviewed by the contributing Governments at intervals not exceeding three years. The managing Government shall initiate the action necessary to this end. 

Regulation 7 
Speed near ice 
When ice is reported on or near his course the master of every ship at night is bound to proceed at a moderate speed or to alter his course so as to go well clear of the danger zone. 

Regulation 8 
Routeing 
(a) The practice of following, particularly in converging areas, routes adopted for the purpose of separation of traffic including avoidance of passage through areas designated as areas to be avoided by ships or certain classes of ships, or for the purpose of avoiding unsafe conditions, has contributed to the safety of navigation and is recommended for use by all ships concerned. 
(b) The Organization is recognized as the only international body for establishing and adopting measures on an international level concerning routeing and areas to be avoided by ships or certain classes of ships. It will collate and disseminate to Contracting Governments all relevant information. 
(c) The selection of the routes and the initiation of action with regard to them, and the delineation of what constitutes converging areas, will be primarily the responsibility of the Governments concerned. In the development of routeing schemes which impinge upon international waters, or such other schemes they may wish adopted by the Organization, they will give due consideration to relevant information published by the Organization. 
(d) Contracting Governments will use their influence to secure the appropriate use of adopted routes and will do everything in their power to ensure adherence to the measures adopted by the Organization in connexion with routeing of ships. 
(e) Contracting Governments will also induce all ships proceeding on voyages in the vicinity of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to avoid, as far as practicable, the fishing banks of Newfoundland north of latitude 43deg. N and to pass outside regions known or believed to be endangered by ice. 

Regulation 9 
Misuse of distress signals 
The use of an international distress signal, except for the purpose of indicating that a ship or aircraft is in distress, and the use of any signal which may be confused with an international distress signal, are prohibited on every ship or aircraft. 

Regulation 10 
Distress messages - obligations and procedures 
(a) The master of a ship at sea, on receiving a signal from any source that a ship or aircraft or survival craft thereof is in distress, is bound to proceed with all speed to the assistance of the persons in distress informing them if possible that he is doing so. If he is unable or, in the special circumstances of the case, considers it unreasonable or unnecessary to proceed to their assistance, he must enter in the logbook the reason for failing to proceed to the assistance of the persons in distress. 
(b) The master of a ship in distress, after consultation, so far as may be possible, with the masters of the ships which answer his call for assistance, has the right to requisition such one or more of those ships as he considers best able to render assistance, and it shall be the duty of the master or masters of the ship or ships requisitioned to comply with the requisition by continuing to proceed with all speed to the assistance of persons in distress. 
(c) The master of a ship shall be released from the obligation imposed by paragraph (a) of this Regulation when he learns that one or more ships other than his own have been requisitioned and are complying with the requisition. 
(d) The master of a ship shall be released from the obligation imposed by paragraph (a) of this Regulation, and, if his ship has been requisitioned, from the obligation imposed by paragraph (b) of this Regulation, if he is informed by the persons in distress or by the master of another ship which has reached such persons that assistance is no longer necessary. 
(e) The provisions of this Regulation do not prejudice the International Convention for the unification of certain rules of law relating to Assistance and Salvage at Sea, signed at Brussels on 23 September 1910, particularly the obligation to render assistance imposed by Article 11 of that Convention. 

Regulation 11 
Signalling lamps 
All ships of over 150 tons gross tonnage, when engaged on international voyages, shall have on board an efficient daylight signalling lamp which shall not be solely dependent upon the ship's main source of electrical power. 

Regulation 12 
Shipborne navigational equipment 
(a) All ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards shall be fitted with a radar of a type approved by the Administration. Facilities for plotting radar readings shall be provided on the bridge in those ships. 
(b) All ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards, when engaged on international voyages, shall be fitted with radio direction-finding apparatus complying with the provisions of Regulation 12 of Chapter IV. The Administration may, in areas where it considers it unreasonable or unnecessary for such apparatus to be carried, exempt any ship of less than 5,000 tons gross tonnage from this requirement, due regard being had to the fact that radio direction-finding apparatus is of value both as a navigational instrument and as an aid to locating ships, aircraft or survival craft. 
(c) All ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards, when engaged on international voyages, shall be fitted with a gyro-compass in addition to the magnetic compass. The Administration, if it considers it unreasonable or unnecessary to require a gyro-compass, may exempt any ship of less than 5,000 tons gross tonnage from this requirement. 
(d) All new ships of 500 tons gross tonnage and upwards, when engaged on international voyages, shall be fitted with an echo-sounding device. 
(e) Whilst all reasonable steps shall be taken to maintain the apparatus in an efficient condition, malfunction of the radar equipment, the gyro-compass or the echo-sounding device shall not be considered as making the ship unseaworthy or as a reason for delaying the ship in ports where repair facilities are not readily available. 
(f) All new ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards, when engaged on international voyages, shall be fitted with radio equipment for homing on the radiotelephone distress frequency complying with the relevant provisions of paragraph (b) of Regulation 12 of Chapter IV. 

Regulation 13

Regulation 14 
Aids to navigation 
The Contracting Governments undertake to arrange for the establishment and maintenance of such aids to navigation, including radio beacons and electronic aids as, in their opinion, the volume of traffic justifies and the degree of risk requires, and to arrange for information relating to these aids to be made available to all concerned. 

Regulation 15 
Search and rescue 
(a) Each Contracting Government undertakes to ensure that any necessary arrangements are made for coast watching and for the rescue of persons in distress at sea round its coasts. These arrangements should include the establishment, operation and maintenance of such maritime safety facilities as are deemed practicable and necessary having regard to the density of the seagoing traffic and the navigational dangers and should, so far as possible, afford adequate means of locating and rescuing such persons. 
(b) Each Contracting Government undertakes to make available information concerning its existing rescue facilities and the plans for changes therein, if any. 

Regulation 16 
Life-saving signals 
The following signals shall be used by life-saving stations and maritime rescue units when communicating with ships or persons in distress and by ships or persons in distress when communicating with life-saving stations and maritime rescue units.

(ii) The ladder shall be secured in a position so that it is clear from any possible discharges from the ship, that each step rests firmly against the ship's side, that it is clear so far as is practicable of the finer lines of the ship and that the pilot can gain safe and convenient access to the ship after climbing not less than 1.5 metres (5 feet) and not more than 9 metres (30 feet). A single length of ladder shall be used capable of reaching the water from the point of access to the ship; in providing for this due allowance shall be made for all conditions of loading and trim of the ship and for an adverse list of 15 degrees. Whenever the distance from sea level to the point of access to the ship is more than 9 metres (30 feet), access from the pilot ladder to the ship shall be by means of an accommodation ladder or other equally safe and convenient means. 
(iii) The steps of the pilot ladder shall be: 
(1) of hardwood, or other material of equivalent properties, made in one piece free of knots, having an efficient non-slip surface; the four lowest steps may be made of rubber of sufficient strength and stiffness or of other suitable material of equivalent characteristics; 
(2) not less than 480 millimetres (19 inches) long, 115 millimetres (41/2 inches) wide, and 25 millimetres (1 inch) in depth, excluding any non-slip device; 
(3) equally spaced not less than 300 millimetres (12 inches) nor more than 380 millimetres (15 inches) apart and be secured in such a manner that they will remain horizontal. 
(iv) No pilot ladder shall have more than two replacement steps which are secured in position by a method different from that used in the original construction of the ladder and any steps so secured shall be replaced as soon as reasonably practicable by steps secured in position by the method used in the original construction of the ladder. When any replacement step is secured to the side ropes of the ladder by means of grooves in the sides of the step, such grooves shall be in the longer sides of the step. 
(v) The side ropes of the ladder shall consist of two uncovered manila ropes not less than 60 millimetres (21/4 inches) in circumference on each side. Each rope shall be continuous with no joints below the top step. Two man-ropes properly secured to the ship and not less than 65 millimetres (21/2 inches) in circumference and a safety line shall be kept at hand ready for use if required. 
(vi) Battens made of hardwood, or other material of equivalent properties, in one piece and not less than 1.80 metres (5 feet 10 inches) long shall be provided at such intervals as will prevent the pilot ladder from twisting. The lowest batten shall be on the fifth step from the bottom of the ladder and the interval between any batten and the next shall not exceed 9 steps. 
(vii) Means shall be provided to ensure safe and convenient passage on to or into and off the ship between the head of the pilot ladder or of any accommodation ladder or other appliance provided. Where such passage is by means of a gateway in the rails or bulwark, adequate handholds shall be provided. Where such passage is by means of a bulwark ladder, such ladder shall be securely attached to the bulwark rail or platform and two handhold stanchions shall be fitted at the point of boarding or leaving the ship not less than 0.70 metre (2 feet 3 inches) nor more than 0.80 metre (2 feet 7 inches) apart.

(viii) Lighting shall be provided at night such that both the pilot ladder overside and also the position where the pilot boards the ship shall be adequately lit. A lifebuoy equipped with a self-igniting light shall be kept at hand ready for use. A heaving line shall be kept at hand ready for use if required. 
(ix) Means shall be provided to enable the pilot ladder to be used on either side of the ship. 
(x) The rigging of the ladder and the embarkation and disembarkation of a pilot shall be supervised by a responsible officer of the ship. 
(xi) Where on any ship constructional features such as rubbing bands would prevent the implementation of any of these provisions, special arrangements shall be made to the satisfaction of the Administration to ensure that persons are able to embark and disembark safely. 
(b) Mechanical pilot hoists 
(i) A mechanical pilot hoist, if provided, and its ancillary equipment shall be of a type approved by the Administration. It shall be of such design and construction as to ensure that the pilot can be embarked and disembarked in a safe manner including a safe access from the hoist to the deck and vice versa. 
(ii) A pilot ladder complying with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Regulation shall be kept on deck adjacent to the hoist and available for immediate use. 

Regulation 18 
VHF radiotelephone stations 
When a Contracting Government requires ships navigating in an area under its sovereignty to be provided with a Very High Frequency (VHF) radiotelephone station to be used in conjunction with a system which it has established in order to promote safety of navigation, such station shall comply with the provisions of Regulation 17 of Chapter IV and shall be operated in accordance with Regulation 8 of Chapter IV. 

Regulation 19 
Use of the automatic pilot 
(a) In areas of high traffic density, in conditions of restricted visibility and in all other hazardous navigational situations where the automatic pilot is used, it shall be possible to establish human control of the ship's steering immediately. 
(b) In circumstances as above, it shall be possible for the officer of the watch to have available without delay the services of a qualified helmsman who shall be ready at all times to take over steering control. 
(c) The change-over from automatic to manual steering and vice versa shall be made by or under the supervision of a responsible officer. 

Regulation 20

This publication shall also be carried by any other ship which in the opinion of the Administration has a need to use it. 

CHAPTER VI 
CARRIAGE OF GRAIN 

PART A - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Regulation 1 
Application 
Unless expressly provided otherwise, this Chapter, including Parts A, B and C, applies to the carriage of grain in all ships to which the present Regulations apply. 

Regulation 2 
Definitions 
(a) The term "grain" includes wheat, maize (corn), oats, rye, barley, rice, pulses, seeds and processed forms thereof, whose behaviour is similar to that of grain in its natural state. 
(b) The term "filled compartment" refers to any compartment in which, after loading and trimming as required under Regulation 3, the bulk grain is at its highest possible level. 
(c) The term "partly filled compartment" refers to any compartment wherein bulk grain is not loaded in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b) of this Regulation. 
(d) The term "angle of flooding" (f) means an angle of heel at which openings in the hull, superstructures or deckhouses, which cannot be closed weathertight, immerse. In applying this definition, small openings through which progressive flooding cannot take place need not be considered as open. 

Regulation 3 
Trimming of grain 
All necessary and reasonable trimming shall be performed to level all free grain surfaces and to minimize the effect of grain shifting. 
(a) In any "filled compartment", the bulk grain shall be trimmed so as to fill all the spaces under the decks and hatch covers to the maximum extent possible. 
(b) After loading, all free grain surfaces in "partly filled compartments" shall be level. 
(c) The Administration issuing the document of authorization may, under Regulation 9 of this Chapter, grant dispensation from trimming in those cases where the underdeck void geometry resulting from free flowing grain into a compartment, which may be provided with feeding ducts, perforated decks or other similar means, is taken into account to its satisfaction when calculating the void depths. 

Regulation 4 
Intact stability requirements 
(a) The calculations required by this Regulation shall be based upon the stability information provided in accordance with Regulation 19 of Chapter II-l, of the present Convention, or with the requirements of the Administration issuing the document of authorization under Regulation 10 of this Chapter. 
(b) The intact stability characteristics of any ship carrying bulk grain shall be shown to meet, throughout the voyage, at least the following criteria after taking into account in the manner described in Part B, the heeling moments due to grain shift: 
(i) the angle of heel due to the shift of grain shall be not greater than 12 degrees except that an Administration giving authorization in accordance with Regulation 10 of this Chapter may require a lesser angle of heel if it considers that experience shows this to be necessary;[37] 
(ii) in the statical stability diagram, the net or residual area between the heeling arm curve and the righting arm curve up to the angle of heel of maximum difference between the ordinates of the two curves, or 40 degrees or the "angle of flooding" (f), whichever is the least, shall in all conditions of loading be not less than 0.075 metre-radians; and 
(iii) the initial metacentric height, after correction for the free surface effects of liquids in tanks, shall be not less than 0.30 metre. 
(c) Before loading bulk grain the master shall, if so required by the Contracting Government of the country of the port of loading, demonstrate the ability of the ship at all stages of any voyage to comply with the stability criteria required by paragraph (b) of this Regulation using the information approved and issued under Regulations 10 and 11 of this Chapter, 
(d) After loading, the master shall ensure that the ship shall be upright before proceeding to sea. 

Regulation 5 
Longitudinal divisions and saucers 
(a) In both "filled compartments" and "partly filled compartments", longitudinal divisions may be provided as a device either to reduce the adverse heeling effect of grain shift or to limit the depth of cargo used for securing the grain surface. Such divisions shall be fitted grain-tight and constructed in accordance with the provisions of Section I of Part C of this Chapter. 
(b) In a "filled compartment", a division, if fitted to reduce the adverse effects of grain shift, shall: 
(i) in a 'tween-deck compartment extend from deck to deck; and 
(ii) in a hold extend downwards from the underside of the deck or hatch covers as described in Section II of Part B of this Chapter. 
Except in the case of linseed and other seeds having similar properties, a longitudinal division beneath a hatchway may be replaced by a saucer formed in the manner described in Section I of Part C of this Chapter. 
(c) In a "partly filled compartment", a division, if fitted, shall extend from one-eighth of the maximum breadth of the compartment above the level of the grain surface and to the same distance below the grain surface. When used to limit the depth of overstowing, the height of the centreline division shall be at least 0.6 metre above the level grain surface. 
(d) Furthermore, the adverse heeling effects of grain shift may be reduced by tightly stowing the wings and ends of a compartment with bagged grain or other suitable cargo adequately restrained from shifting. 

Regulation 6 
Securing 
(a) Unless account is taken of the adverse heeling effect due to grain shift in accordance with these Regulations, the surface of the bulk grain in any "partly filled compartment" shall be level and topped off with bagged grain tightly stowed and extending to a height of not less than one-sixteenth of the maximum breadth of the free grain surface or 1.2 metres, whichever is the greater. Instead of bagged grain, other suitable cargo exerting at least the same pressure may be used. 
(b) The bagged grain or such other suitable cargo shall be supported in the manner described in Section II of Part C of this Chapter. Alternatively, the bulk grain surface may be secured by strapping or lashing as described in that Section. 

Regulation 7 
Feeders and trunks 
If feeders or trunks are fitted, proper account shall be taken of the effects thereof when calculating the heeling moments as described in Section III of Part B of this Chapter. The strength of the divisions forming the boundaries of such feeders shall conform with the provisions of Section I of Part C of this Chapter. 

Regulation 8 
Combination arrangements 
Lower holds and 'tween-deck spaces in way thereof may be loaded as one compartment provided that, in calculating transverse heeling moments, proper account is taken of the flow of grain into the lower spaces. 

Regulation 9 
Application of Parts B and C 
An Administration or a Contracting Government on behalf of an Administration may authorize departure from the assumptions contained in Parts B and C of this Chapter in those cases where it considers this to be justified having regard to the provisions for loading or the structural arrangements, provided the stability criteria in paragraph (b) of Regulation 4 of this Chapter are met. Where such authorization is granted under this Regulation, particulars shall be included in the document of authorization or grain loading data. 

Regulation 10 
Authorization 
(a) A document of authorization shall be issued for every ship loaded in accordance with the Regulations of this Chapter either by the Administration or an organization recognized by it or by a Contracting Government on behalf of the Administration. It shall be accepted as evidence that the ship is capable of complying with the requirements of these Regulations. 
(b) The document shall accompany and refer to the grain loading stability booklet provided to enable the master to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of Regulation 4 of this Chapter. This booklet shall meet the requirements of Regulation 11 of this Chapter. 
(c) Such a document, grain loading stability data and associated plans may be drawn up in the official language or languages of the issuing country. If the language used is neither English nor French, the text shall include a translation into one of these languages. 
(d) A copy of such a document, grain loading stability data and associated plans shall be placed on board in order that the master, if so required, shall produce them for the inspection of the Contracting Government of the country of the port of loading. 
(e) A ship without such a document of authorization shall not load grain until the master demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administration or the Contracting Government of the port of loading on behalf of the Administration that the ship in its proposed loaded condition will comply with the requirements of these Regulations. 

Regulation 11 
Grain loading information 
This information shall be sufficient to allow the master to determine in all reasonable loading conditions the heeling moments due to grain shift calculated in accordance with Part B of this Chapter. It shall include the following: 
(a) Information which shall be approved by the Administration or by a Contracting Government on behalf of the Administration: 
(i) curves or tables of grain heeling moments for every compartment, filled or partly filled, or combination thereof, including the effects of temporary fittings; 
(ii) tables of maximum permissible heeling moments or other information sufficient to allow the master to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of Regulation 4 of this Chapter; 
(iii) details of the scantlings of any temporary fittings and where applicable the provisions necessary to meet the requirements of Section I(E) of Part C of this Chapter; 
(iv) typical loaded service departure and arrival conditions and where necessary, intermediate worst service conditions; 
(v) a worked example for the guidance of the master; 
(vi) loading instructions in the form of notes summarizing the requirements of this Chapter. 
(b) Information which shall be acceptable to the Administration or to a Contracting Government on behalf of the Administration: 
(i) ship's particulars; 
(ii) lightship displacement and the vertical distance from the intersection of the moulded base line and midship section to the centre of gravity (KG); 
(iii) table of free surface corrections; 
(iv) capacities and centres of gravity. 

Regulation 12 
Equivalents 
Where an equivalent accepted by the Administration in accordance with Regulation 5 of Chapter I of this Convention is applied, particulars shall be included in the document of authorization or grain loading data. 

Regulation 13 
Exemptions for certain voyages 
The Administration, or a Contracting Government on behalf of the Administration may, if it considers that the sheltered nature and conditions of the voyage are such as to render the application of any of the requirements of Regulations 3 to 12 of this Chapter unreasonable or unnecessary, exempt from those particular requirements individual ships or classes of ships. 

PART B - CALCULATION OF ASSUMED HEELING MOMENTS 

SECTION I - DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSUMED VOIDS AND METHOD OF CALCULATING INTACT STABILITY 
(A) GENERAL 
(a) For the purpose of calculating the adverse heeling moment due to a shift of cargo surface in ships carrying bulk grain it shall be assumed that: 
(i) In "filled compartments" which have been trimmed in accordance with Regulation 3 of this Chapter a void exists under all boundary surfaces having an inclination to the horizontal less than 30 degrees and that the void is parallel to the boundary surface having an average depth calculated according to the formula: 

Where: 
Vd = Average void depth in mm; 
Vd1 = Standard void depth from Table I below; 
d = Actual girder depth in mm. 
In no case shall Vd be assumed to be less than 100 mm.

Notes on Table I: 
For distances greater than 8.0 metres the standard void depth Vd1 shall be linearly extrapolated at 80 mm increase for each 1.0 metre increase in distance. Where there is a difference in depth between the hatchside girder or its continuation and the hatchend beam the greater depth shall be used except that: 
(1) when the hatchside girder or its continuation is shallower than the hatchend beam the voids abreast the hatchway may be calculated using the lesser depth; and 
(2) where the hatchend beam is shallower than the hatchside girder or its continuation the voids fore and aft of the hatchway inboard of the continuation of the hatchside girder may be calculated using the lesser depth; 
(3) where there is a raised deck clear of a hatchway the average void depth measured from the underside of the raised deck shall be calculated using the standard void depth in association with a girder depth of the hatchend beam plus the height of the raised deck. 
(ii) In "filled compartments" which are not trimmed in accordance with Regulation 3 of this Chapter and where the boundary surface has an inclination to the horizontal which is less than 30 degrees, the cargo surface has an inclination of 30 degrees to the horizontal after loading. 
(iii) Within filled hatchways and in addition to any open void within the hatch cover there is a void of average depth of 150 mm measured down to the grain surface from the lowest part of the hatch cover or the top of the hatchside coaming, whichever is the lower. 
(b) The description of the pattern of grain surface behaviour to be assumed in "partly filled compartments" is shown in Section IV of this Part. 
(c) For the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the stability criteria in paragraph (b) of Regulation 4 of this Chapter (see Figure 1), the ship's stability calculations shall be normally based upon the assumption that the centre of gravity of cargo in a "filled compartment" is at the volumetric centre of the whole cargo space. In those cases where the Administration authorizes account to be taken of the effect of assumed underdeck voids on the vertical position of the centre of gravity of the cargo in "filled compartments" it will be necessary to compensate for the adverse effect of the vertical shift of grain surfaces by increasing the assumed heeling moment due to the transverse shift of grain as follows: 
total heeling moment = 1.06 x calculated transverse heeling moment. 
In all cases the weight of cargo in a "filled compartment" shall be the volume of the whole cargo space divided by the stowage factor. 

(d) In "partly filled compartments" the adverse effect of the vertical shift of grain surfaces shall be taken into account as follows: 
total heeling moment = 1.12 x calculated transverse heeling moment. 
(e) Any other equally effective method may be adopted to make the compensation required in paragraphs (c) and (d) above. 
SECTION II - ASSUMED VOLUMETRIC HEELING MOMENT OF A FILLED COMPARTMENT 
(A) GENERAL 
(a) The pattern of grain surface movement relates to a transverse section across the portion of the compartment being considered and the resultant heeling moment should be multiplied by the length to obtain the total moment for that portion. 
(b) The assumed transverse heeling moment due to grain shifting is a consequence of final changes of shape and position of voids after grain has moved from the high side to the low side. 
(c) The resulting grain surface after shifting shall be assumed to be at 15 degrees to the horizontal. 
(d) In calculating the maximum void area that can be formed against a longitudinal structural member, the effects of any horizontal surfaces, e.g. flanges or face bars, shall be ignored. 
(e) The total areas of the initial and final voids shall be equal. 
(f) A discontinuous longitudinal division shall be considered effective over its full length. 
(B) ASSUMPTIONS 
In the following paragraphs it is assumed that the total heeling moment for a compartment is obtained by adding the results of separate considerations of the following portions: 
(a) Before and abaft hatchways: 
(i) If a compartment has two or more main hatchways through which loading may take place the depth of the underdeck void for the portion(s) between such hatchways shall be determined using the fore and aft distance to the midpoint between the hatchways. 
(ii) After the assumed shift of grain the final void pattern shall be as shown in Figure 2 below: 

(b) In and abreast hatchways: 
After the assumed shift of grain the final void pattern shall be as shown in the following Figure 3 or Figure 4. 


(C) COMPARTMENTS LOADED IN COMBINATION 
The following paragraphs describe the pattern of void behaviour which shall be assumed when compartments are loaded in combination: 
(a) Without effective centreline divisions: 
(i) under the upper deck - as for the single deck arrangement described in Section II(B) of this Part. 
(ii) Under the second deck - the area of void available for transfer from the low side, i.e. original void area less area against the hatchside girder, shall be assumed to transfer as follows: 
one half to the upper deck hatchway and one quarter each to the high side under the upper and second deck. 
(iii) Under the third and lower decks - the void areas available for transfer from the low side of each of these decks shall be assumed to transfer in equal quantities to all the voids under the decks on the high side and the void in the upper deck hatchway. 
(b) With effective centreline divisions which extend into the upper deck hatchway: 
(i) At all deck levels abreast the division the void areas available for transfer from the low side shall be assumed to transfer to the void under the low side half of the upper deck hatchway. 
(ii) At the deck level immediately below the bottom of the division the void area available for transfer from the low side shall be assumed to transfer as follows: 
one half to the void under the low side half of the upper deck hatchway and the remainder in equal quantities to the voids under the decks on the high side. 
(iii) At deck levels lower than those described in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph the void area available for transfer from the low side of each of those decks shall be assumed to transfer in equal quantities to the voids in each of the two halves of the upper deck hatchway on each side of the division and the voids under the decks on the high side. 
(c) With effective centreline divisions which do not extend into the upper deck hatchway: 
Since no horizontal transfer of voids may be assumed to take place at the same deck level as the division the void area available for transfer from the low side at this level shall be assumed to transfer above the division to voids on the high sides in accordance with the principles of paragraphs (a) and (b) above. 
SECTION III - ASSUMED VOLUMETRIC HEELING MOMENT OF FEEDERS AND TRUNKS 
(A) SUITABLY PLACED WING FEEDERS (See Figure 5) 
It may be assumed that under the influence of ship motion underdeck voids will be substantially filled by the flow of grain from a pair of longitudinal feeders provided that: 
(a) the feeders extend for the full length of the deck and that the perforations therein are adequately spaced; 
(b) the volume of each feeder is equal to the volume of the underdeck void outboard of the hatchside girder and its continuation. 

(B) TRUNKS SITUATED OVER MAIN HATCHWAYS 
After the assumed shift of grain the final void pattern shall be as shown in Figure 6. 

SECTION IV - ASSUMED VOLUMETRIC HEELING MOMENT OF PARTLY FILLED COMPARTMENTS 

(A) GENERAL 
When the free surface of the bulk grain has not been secured in accordance with Regulation 6 of this Chapter it shall be assumed that the grain surface after shifting shall be at 25 degrees to the horizontal. 

(B) DISCONTINUOUS LONGITUDINAL DIVISIONS 
In a compartment in which the longitudinal divisions are not continuous between the transverse boundaries, the length over which any such divisions are effective as devices to prevent full width shifts of grain surfaces shall be taken to be the actual length of the portion of the division under consideration less two-sevenths of the greater of the transverse distances between the division and its adjacent division or ship's side. 
This correction does not apply in the lower compartments of any combination loading in which the upper compartment is either a "filled compartment" or a "partly filled compartment". 

SECTION V - ALTERNATIVE LOADING ARRANGEMENTS FOR EXISTING SHIPS 

(A) GENERAL 
A ship loaded in accordance with either Sub-Section (B) or Sub-Section (C) below shall be considered to have intact stability characteristics at least equivalent to the requirements of paragraph (b) of Regulation 4 of this Chapter. Documents of authorization permitting such loadings shall be accepted under the provisions of paragraph (e) of Regulation 10 of this Chapter. 
For the purpose of this Part, the term "Existing Ship" means a ship, the keel of which is laid before the date of coming into force of this Chapter. 

(B) STOWAGE OF SPECIALLY SUITABLE SHIPS 
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in Part B of this Chapter, bulk grain may be carried without regard to the requirements specified therein in ships which are constructed with two or more vertical or sloping grain-tight longitudinal divisions suitably disposed to limit the effect of any transverse shift of grain under the following conditions: 
(i) as many holds and compartments as possible shall be full and trimmed full; 
(ii) for any specified arrangement of stowage the ship will not list to an angle greater than 5 degrees at any stage of the voyage where: 
(1) in holds or compartments which have been trimmed full the grain surface settled 2 per cent by volume from the original surface and shifts to an angle of 12 degrees with that surface under all boundaries of these holds and compartments which have an inclination of less than 30 degrees to the horizontal; 
(2) in "partly filled compartments or holds" free grain surfaces settle and shift as in sub-paragraph (ii)(1) of this paragraph or to such larger angle as may be deemed necessary by the Administration, or by a Contracting Government on behalf of the Administration, and grain surfaces if overstowed in accordance with Regulation 5 of this Chapter shift to an angle of 8 degrees with the original levelled surfaces. For the purpose of sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph shifting boards, if fitted, will be considered to limit the transverse shift of the surface of the grain; 
(iii) the master is provided with a grain loading plan covering the stowage arrangements to be adopted and a stability booklet, both approved by the Administration, or by a Contracting Government on behalf of the Administration, showing the stability conditions upon which the calculations given in sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph are based. 
(b) The Administration, or a Contracting Government on behalf of the Administration, shall prescribe the precautions to be taken against shifting in all other conditions of loading of ships designed in accordance with paragraph (B)(a) of this Section which meet the requirements of sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of that paragraph. 

(C) SHIPS WITHOUT DOCUMENTS OF AUTHORIZATION 
A ship not having on board documents of authorization issued in accordance with Regulations 4 and 10 of this Chapter may be permitted to load bulk grain under the requirements of Sub-Section (B) of this Section or provided that: 
(a) All "filled compartments" shall be fitted with centreline divisions extending for the full length of such compartments which extend downwards from the underside of the deck or hatch covers to a distance below the deck line of at least one-eighth of the maximum breadth of the compartment or 2.4 metres, whichever is the greater except that saucers constructed in accordance with Section II of Part C may be accepted in lieu of a centreline division in and beneath a hatchway except in the case of linseed and other seeds having similar properties. 
(b) All hatches to "filled compartments" shall be closed and covers secured in place. 
(c) All free grain surfaces in "partly filled compartments" shall be trimmed level and secured in accordance with Section II of Part C. 
(d) Throughout the voyage the metacentric height after correction for the free surface effects of liquids in tanks shall be 0.3 metre or that given by the following formula, whichever is the greater: 

Where: 
L = total combined length of all full compartments; 
B = moulded breadth of vessel; 
SF = stowage factor; 
Vd = calculated average void depth as per paragraph (a)(i) of Section I(A) of this Part; 
= displacement. 

PART C - GRAIN FITTINGS AND SECURING 
SECTION I - STRENGTH OF GRAIN FITTINGS 

(A) GENERAL 
(a) Timber 
All timber used for grain fittings shall be of good sound quality and of a type and grade which has been proved to be satisfactory for this purpose. The actual finished dimensions of the timber shall be in accordance with the dimensions hereinafter specified in this Part. Plywood of an exterior type bonded with waterproof glue and fitted so that the direction of the grain in the face plies is perpendicular to the supporting uprights or binder may be used provided that its strength is equivalent to that of solid timber of the appropriate scantlings. 
(b) Working stresses 
When calculating the dimensions of divisions loaded on one side, using the Tables in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sub-Section (C) of this Section, the following working stresses should be adopted: 
For divisions of steel ........ 2000 kg per square cm 
For divisions of wood ....... 160 kg per square cm 
(c) Other materials 
Materials other than wood or steel may be approved for such divisions provided that proper regard has been paid to their mechanical properties. 
(d) Uprights 
(i) Unless means are provided to prevent the end of uprights being dislodged from their sockets, the depth of housing at each end of each upright shall be not less than 75 mm. If an upright is not secured at the top, the uppermost shore or stay shall be fitted as near thereto as is practicable. 
(ii) The arrangements provided for inserting shifting boards by removing a part of the cross-section of an upright shall be such that the local level of stresses is not unduly high. 
(iii) The maximum bending moment imposed upon an upright supporting a division loaded on one side shall normally be calculated assuming that the ends of the uprights are freely supported. However, if an Administration is satisfied that any degree of fixity assumed will be achieved in practice, account may be taken of any reduction in the maximum bending moment arising from any degree of fixity provided at the ends of the upright. 
(e) Composite section 
Where uprights, binders or any other strength members are formed by two separate sections, one fitted on each side of a division and inter-connected by through bolts at adequate spacing, the effective section modules shall be taken as the sum of the two moduli of the separate sections. 
(f) Partial division 
Where divisions do not extend to the full depth of the hold such divisions and their uprights shall be supported or stayed so as to be as efficient as those which do extend to the full depth of the hold. 

(B) DIVISIONS LOADED ON BOTH SIDES 
(a) Shifting boards 
(i) Shifting boards shall have a thickness of not less than 50 mm and shall be fitted grain-tight and where necessary supported by uprights. 
(ii) The maximum unsupported span for shifting boards of various thicknesses shall be as follows: 
Thickness 
Maximum unsupported span 





50 mm 

2.5 metres 

60 mm 

3.0 metres 

70 mm 

3.5 metres 

80 mm 

4.0 metres 

If thicknesses greater than these are provided the maximum unsupported span will vary directly with the increase in thickness. 
(iii) The ends of all shifting boards shall be securely housed with 75 mm minimum bearing length. 
(b) Other materials 
Divisions formed by using materials other than wood shall have a strength equivalent to the shifting boards required in paragraph (a) of this Sub-Section. 
(c) Uprights 
(i) Steel uprights used to support divisions loaded on both sides shall have a section modulus given by 

Where: 
W = section modulus in cm3; 
a = horizontal span between uprights in metres. 
The section modulus per metre span W1 shall be not less than that given by the formula: 
= 14.8 cm3 per metre; 
Where: 
h1 is the vertical unsupported span in metres and shall be taken as the maximum value of the distance between any two adjacent stays or between the stay or either end of the upright. Where this distance is less than 2.4 metres the respective modulus shall be calculated as if the actual value was 2.4 metres. 
(ii) The moduli of wood uprights shall be determined by multiplying by 12.5 the corresponding moduli for steel uprights. If other materials are used their moduli shall be at least that required for steel increased in proportion to the ratio of the permissible stresses for steel to that of the material used. In such cases attention shall be paid also to the relative rigidity of each upright to ensure that the deflection is not excessive. 
(iii) The horizontal distance between uprights shall be such that the unsupported spans of the shifting boards do not exceed the maximum span specified in sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of this Sub-Section. 
(d) Shores 
(i) Wood shores, when used, shall be in a single piece and shall be securely fixed at each end and heeled against the permanent structure of the ship except that they shall not bear directly against the side plating of the ship. 
(ii) Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraphs (iii) and (iv) below, the minimum size of wood shores shall be as follows: 
Length of shore in metres 
Rectangular section 

Diameter of circular section

Shores of 7 metres or more in length shall be securely bridged at approximately mid-length. 
(iii) When the horizontal distance between the uprights differs significantly from 4 metres, the moments of inertia of the shores may be changed in direct proportion. 
(iv) Where the angle of the shore to the horizontal exceeds 10 degrees the next larger shore to that required by sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph shall be fitted provided that in no case shall the angle between any shore and the horizontal exceed 45 degrees. 
(e) Stays 
Where stays are used to support divisions loaded on both sides, they shall be fitted horizontally or as near thereto as practicable, well secured at each end and formed of steel wire rope. The sizes of the wire rope shall be determined assuming that the divisions and upright which the stay supports are uniformly loaded at 500 kg/m2. The working load so assumed in the stay shall not exceed one-third of its breaking load. 

(C) DIVISIONS LOADED ON ONE SIDE ONLY

L = longitudinal extent of the bulk grain in metres 
For other values of h or L the reaction loads shall be determined by linear interpolation or extrapolation as necessary. 
The strength of the end connexions of such vertical members or uprights may be calculated on the basis of the maximum load likely to be imposed at either end. These loads are as follows: 
Longitudinal Divisions 
Maximum load at the top 50% of the appropriate total load from Table I 
Maximum load at the bottom 55% of the appropriate total load from Table I 
Transverse Divisions 
Maximum load at the top 45% of the appropriate total load from Table II 
Maximum load at the bottom 60% of the appropriate total load from Table II 
The thickness of horizontal wooden boards may also be determined having regard to the vertical distribution of the loading represented by Tables III and IV above and in such cases 

Where: 
t = thickness of board in mm; 
a = horizontal span of the board i.e. distance between uprights in metres; 
h = head of grain to the bottom of the division in metres; 
p = total load per unit length derived from Table I or II in kilogrammes; 
k = factor dependent upon vertical distribution of the loading. 
When the vertical distribution of the loading is assumed to be uniform, i.e. rectangular, k shall be taken as equal to 1.0. For a trapezoidal distribution 
k = 1.0 + 0.06 (50 - R) 
Where: 
R is the upper end bearing reaction taken from Table III or IV. 
(d) Stays or shores 
The sizes of stays and shores shall be so determined that the loads derived from Tables I and II in the preceding paragraphs (a) and (b) shall not exceed one-third of the breaking loads. 
(D) SAUCERS 
When a saucer is used to reduce the heeling moments in a "filled compartment", its depth, measured from the bottom of the saucer to the deck line, shall be as follows: 
For ships with a moulded breadth of up to 9.1 metres, not less than 1.2 metres. 
For ships with a moulded breadth of 18.3 metres or more, not less than 1.8 metres. 
For ships with a moulded breadth between 9.1 metres and 18.3 metres, the minimum depth of the saucer shall be calculated by interpolation. 
The top (mouth) of the saucer shall be formed by the underdeck structure in the way of the hatchway, i.e. hatchside girders or coamings and hatchend beams. The saucer and hatchway above shall be completely filled with bagged grain or other suitable cargo laid down on a separation cloth or its equivalent and stowed tightly against adjacent structures and the portable hatchway beams if the latter are in place. 

(E) BUNDLING OF BULK 
As an alternative to filling the saucer with bagged grain or other suitable cargo a bundle of bulk grain may be used provided that: 
(a) The saucer is lined with a material acceptable to the Administration having a tensile strength of not less than 274 kg per 5 cm strip and which is provided with suitable means for securing at the top. 
(b) As an alternative to paragraph (a) above a material acceptable to the Administration having a tensile strength of not less than 137 kg per 5 cm strip may be used if the saucer is constructed as follows: 
Athwartship lashings acceptable to the Administration shall be placed inside the saucer formed in the bulk grain at intervals of not more than 2.4 metres. These lashing shall be of sufficient length to permit being drawn up tight and secured at the top of the saucer. 
Dunnage not less than 25 mm in thickness or other suitable material of equal strength and between 150 to 300 mm in width shall be placed fore and aft over these lashings to prevent the cutting or chafing of the material which shall be placed thereon to line the saucer. 
(c) The saucer shall be filled with bulk grain and secured at the top except that when using material approved under paragraph (b) above further dunnage shall be laid on top after lapping the material before the saucer is secured by setting up the lashings. 
(d) If more than one sheet of material is used to line the saucer they shall be joined at the bottom either by sewing or a double lap, 
(e) The top of the saucer shall be coincidental with the bottom of the beams when these are in place and suitable general cargo or bulk grain may be placed between the beams on top of the saucer. 

(F) SECURING HATCH COVERS OF FILLED COMPARTMENTS 
If there is no bulk grain or other cargo above a "filled compartment" the hatch covers shall be secured in an approved manner having regard to the weight and permanent arrangements provided for securing such covers. 
The documents of authorization issued under Regulation 10 of this Chapter shall include reference to the manner of securing considered necessary by the Administration issuing such documents. 

SECTION II - SECURING OF PARTLY FILLED COMPARTMENTS 

(A) STRAPPING OR LASHING 
(a) When, in order to eliminate heeling moments in "partly filled compartments", strapping or lashing is utilized, the securing shall be accomplished as follows: 
(i) The grain shall be trimmed and levelled to the extent that it is very slightly crowned and covered with burlap separation cloths, tarpaulins or the equivalent. 
(ii) The separation cloths and/or tarpaulins shall overlap at least 1.8 metres. 
(iii) Two solid floors of rough 25 mm by 150 mm to 300 mm lumber shall be laid with the top floor running longitudinally and nailed to an athwartships bottom floor. Alternatively, one solid floor of 50 mm lumber, running longitudinally and nailed over the top of a 50 mm bottom bearer not less than 150 mm wide, may be used. The bottom bearers shall extend the full breadth of the compartment and shall be spaced not more than 2.4 metres apart. Arrangements utilizing other materials and deemed by an Administration to be equivalent to the foregoing may be accepted, 
(iv) Steel wire rope (19 mm diameter or equivalent), doubled steel strapping (50 mm x 1.3 mm and having a breaking load of at least 5000 kg), or chain of equivalent strength, each of which shall be set tight by means of a 32 mm turnbuckle, may be used for lashings. A winch tightener, used in conjunction with a locking arm, may be substituted for the 32 mm turnbuckle when steel strapping is used, provided suitable wrenches are available for setting up as necessary. When steel strapping is used, not less than three crimp seals shall be used for securing the ends. When wire is used, not less than four clips shall be used for forming eyes in the lashings. 
(v) Prior to the completion of loading the lashing shall be positively attached to the framing at a point approximately 450 mm below the anticipated final grain surface by means of either a 25 mm shackle or beam clamp of equivalent strength. 
(vi) The lashings shall be spaced not more than 2.4 metres apart and each shall be supported by a bearer nailed over the top of the fore and aft floor. This bearer shall consist of not less than 25 mm by 150 mm lumber or its equivalent and shall extend the full breadth of the compartment. 
(vii) During the voyage the strapping shall be regularly inspected and set up where necessary. 

(B) OVERSTOWING ARRANGEMENTS 
Where bagged grain or other suitable cargo is utilized for the purpose of securing "partly filled compartments", the free grain surface shall be covered with a separation cloth or equivalent or by a suitable platform. Such platforms shall consist of bearers spaced not more than 1.2 metres apart and 25 mm boards laid thereon spaced not more than 100 mm apart. Platforms may be constructed of other materials provided they are deemed by an Administration to be equivalent. 

(C) BAGGED GRAIN 
Bagged grain shall be carried in sound bags which shall be well filled and securely closed.

[30] In the absence of a direct measurement of the field strength the following data may be used as a guide for approximately determining the normal range: 
Normal range in milesMetre-amperes1Total antenna power (watts)22001282001751021251507671125584110045257534141 This figure represents the product of the maximum height of the antenna above the deepest load water-line in metres and the antenna current in amperes (R.M.S. value). 
The values given in the second column of the table correspond to an average value of the ratio 
This ratio varies with local conditions of the antenna and may very between about 0.3 and 0.7. 
2 The values given in the third column of the table correspond to an average value of the ratio 
This ratio varies considerably according to the values of effective antenna height and antenna resistance. [Footnote appeared in original text.] 
[31] For the purpose of determining the electrical load to he supplied by the reserve source of energy, the following formula is recommended as a guide: 
1/2 of the transmitter current consumption with the key down (mark) 
+ 1/2 of the transmitter current consumption with the key up (space) 
+ 1/2 current consumption of receiver and additional circuits connected to the reserve source of energy. [Footnote appeared in original text.] 
[32] In the absence of a measurement of the field strength, it may be assumed that this range will be obtained it the product of the height of the antenna above the water-line and the antenna current (R.M.S. value) is 10 metre-amperes. [Footnote appeared in original text.] 
[33] It may be assumed that the purposes of the Regulation will be satisfied by the following performance: 
At least 10 watts input to the anode of the final stage or a radio-frequency output of at least 2.0 watts (A2 emission) at 500 kHz into an artificial antenna having an effective resistance of 15 ohms and 100 x 10-12 farads capacitance in series. The depth of modulation shall be at least 70 per cent. [Footnote appeared in original text.] 
[34] In the absence of field strength measurements, it may be assumed that this range will be obtained by a power in the antenna of 15 watts (unmodulated carrier) with an antenna efficiency of 27 per cent. [Footnote appeared in original text.] 
[35] For the purpose of determining the electrical load to be supplied by batteries required to have six hours reserve capacity, the following formula is recommended as a guide: 
1/2 of the current consumption necessary for speech transmission 
+ current consumption of receiver 
+ current consumption of all additional loads to which the batteries may supply energy in time of distress or emergency. [Footnote appeared in original text.] 
[36] For guidance purposes, it is assumed that each ship would be fitted with a vertically polarized unity gain antenna at a nominal height of 9.15 metres (30 feet) above water, a transmitter R.F. power output of 10 watts, and a receiver sensitivity of 2 microvolts across the input terminals for 20 db signal-to-noise ratio.
