CONVENTION FOR CO-OPERATION IN THE PROTECTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE
MARINE AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE WEST AND CENTRAL AFRICAN REGION

Abidjan, 23 March 1981

      The Contracting Parties,

      Conscious of the economic, social and health value of the marine
environment and coastal areas of the West and Central African Region,

      Fully aware of their responsibility to preserve their natural
heritage  for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future
generations, 

      Recognizing the threat to the marine and coastal environment, its
ecological equilibrium, resources and legitimate uses posed by
pollution and by the absence of an integration of an environmental
dimension into the development process,

Realizing fully the need for co-operation among the Contracting Parties
in order to ensure sustainable, environmentally-sound development
through a co-ordinated and comprehensive approach,

      Realizing also the need for a carefully planned research,
monitoring and assessment programme in view of the scarcity of
scientific information on marine pollution in the West and Central
African Region,

      Noting that existing conventions concerning marine pollution do
not cover, in spite of the progress achieved, all aspects and sources
of marine pollution and do not entirely meet the special requirements
of the West and Central African Region,

      Have agreed as follows:


Article 1
