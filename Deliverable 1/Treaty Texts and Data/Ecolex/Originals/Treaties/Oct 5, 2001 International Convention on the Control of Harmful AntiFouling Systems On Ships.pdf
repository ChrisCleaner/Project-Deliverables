INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE CONTROL OF HARMFUL ANTI-FOULING SYSTEMS ON SHIPS, 2001

THE PARTIES TO THIS CONVENTION,

NOTING that scientific studies and investigations by Governments and competent international  organizations have shown that certain anti-fouling systems used on ships pose a substantial risk of toxicity and other chronic impacts to ecologically and economically important marine organisms and also that human health may be harmed as a result of the consumption of affected seafood,

NOTING IN PARTICULAR the serious concern regarding anti-fouling systems that use organotin compounds as biocides and being convinced that the introduction of such organotins into the environment must be phased-out,

RECALLING that Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, 1992, calls upon States to take measures to reduce pollution caused by organotin compounds used in anti-fouling systems,

RECALLING ALSO that resolution A.895(21), adopted by the Assembly of the International Maritime Organization on 25 November 1999, urges the Organization's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) to work towards the expeditious development of a global legally binding instrument to address the harmful effects of anti-fouling systems as a matter of urgency,

MINDFUL OF the precautionary approach set out in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and referred to in resolution MEPC.67(37) adopted by MEPC on 15 September 1995,

RECOGNIZING the importance of protecting the marine environment and human health from adverse effects of anti-fouling systems,

RECOGNIZING ALSO that the use of anti-fouling systems to prevent the build-up of
organisms on the surface of ships is of critical importance to efficient commerce, shipping and impeding the spread of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens,

RECOGNIZING FURTHER the need to continue to develop anti-fouling systems which are effective and environmentally safe and to promote the substitution of harmful systems by less harmful systems or preferably harmless systems,

HAVE AGREED as follows:

ARTICLE 6

Process for Proposing Amendments to Controls on Anti-Fouling Systems
(1) Any Party may propose an amendment to Annex 1 in accordance with this article.
(2) An initial proposal shall contain the information required in Annex 2, and shall be
submitted to the Organization. When the Organization receives a proposal, it shall bring the proposal to the attention of the Parties, Members of the Organization, the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies, intergovernmental organizations having agreements with the Organization and non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Organization and shall make it available to them.
(3) The Committee shall decide whether the anti-fouling system in question warrants a more in-depth review based on the initial proposal. If the Committee decides that further review is warranted, it shall require the proposing Party to submit to the Committee a comprehensive proposal containing the information required in Annex 3, except where the initial proposal also includes all the information required in Annex 3. Where the Committee is of the view that there is a threat of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a AFS/CONF/26
reason to prevent a decision to proceed with the evaluation of the proposal. The Committee shall establish a technical group in accordance with article 7.
(4) The technical group shall review the comprehensive proposal along with any additional data submitted by any interested entity and shall evaluate and report to the Committee whether the proposal has demonstrated a potential for unreasonable risk of adverse effects on non-target organisms or human health such that the amendment of Annex 1 is warranted. In this regard:
(a) The technical group's review shall include:
(i) an evaluation of the association between the anti-fouling system in
question and the related adverse effects observed either in the environment
or on human health, including, but not limited to, the consumption of
affected seafood, or through controlled studies based on the data described
in Annex 3 and any other relevant data which come to light;
(ii) an evaluation of the potential risk reduction attributable to the proposed
control measures and any other control measures that may be considered
by the technical group;
(iii) consideration of available information on the technical feasibility of
control measures and the cost-effectiveness of the proposal;
(iv) consideration of available information on other effects from the
introduction of such control measures relating to:
- the environment (including, but not limited to, the cost of inaction
and the impact on air quality);
- shipyard health and safety concerns (i.e. effects on shipyard
workers);
- the cost to international shipping and other relevant sectors; and
(v) consideration of the availability of suitable alternatives, including a
consideration of the potential risks of alternatives.
(b) The technical group's report shall be in writing and shall take into account each of
the evaluations and considerations referred to in subparagraph (a), except that the
technical group may decide not to proceed with the evaluations and considerations
described in subparagraph (a)(ii) through (a)(v) if it determines after the
evaluation in subparagraph (a)(i) that the proposal does not warrant further
consideration.
(c) The technical group's report shall include, inter alia, a recommendation on
whether international controls pursuant to this Convention are warranted on the
anti-fouling system in question, on the suitability of the specific control measures
suggested in the comprehensive proposal, or on other control measures which it
believes to be more suitable.
(5) The technical group's report shall be circulated to the Parties, Members of the
Organization, the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies, intergovernmental organizations having agreements with the Organization and non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Organization, prior to its consideration by the Committee. The Committee shall decide whether to approve any proposal to amend Annex 1, and any modifications thereto, if appropriate, taking into account the technical group's report. If the report finds a threat of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not, itself, be used as a reason to prevent a decision from being taken to list an anti-fouling system in Annex 1. The proposed
amendments to Annex 1, if approved by the Committee, shall be circulated in accordance with article 16(2)(a). A decision not to approve the proposal shall not preclude future submission of a new proposal with respect to a particular anti-fouling system if new information comes to light. (6) Only Parties may participate in decisions taken by the Committee described in paragraphs (3) and (5).

ARTICLE 7

Technical Groups
(1) The Committee shall establish a technical group pursuant to article 6 when a
comprehensive proposal is received. In circumstances where several proposals are received concurrently or sequentially, the Committee may establish one or more technical groups as needed.
(2) Any Party may participate in the deliberations of a technical group, and should draw on the relevant expertise available to that Party.
(3) The Committee shall decide on the terms of reference, organization and operation of the technical groups. Such terms shall provide for protection of any confidential information that may be submitted. Technical groups may hold such meetings as required, but shall endeavour to conduct their work through written or electronic correspondence or other media as appropriate.
(4) Only the representatives of Parties may participate in formulating any recommendation to the Committee pursuant to article 6. A technical group shall endeavour to achieve unanimity among the representatives of the Parties. If unanimity is not possible, the technical group shall communicate any minority views of such representatives.
ARTICLE 8
Scientific and Technical Research and Monitoring
(1) The Parties shall take appropriate measures to promote and facilitate scientific and
technical research on the effects of anti-fouling systems as well as monitoring of such effects. In particular, such research should include observation, measurement, sampling, evaluation and analysis of the effects of anti-fouling systems.
(2) Each Party shall, to further the objectives of this Convention, promote the availability of relevant information to other Parties who request it on:
(a) scientific and technical activities undertaken in accordance with this Convention;
(b) marine scientific and technological programmes and their objectives; and
(c) the effects observed from any monitoring and assessment programmes relating to
anti-fouling systems.

developed by the Organization. * However, the time required to process the results
of such sampling shall not be used as a basis for preventing the movement and
departure of the ship.
(2) If there are clear grounds to believe that the ship is in violation of this Convention, a thorough inspection may be carried out taking into account guidelines developed by the
Organization.*
(3) If the ship is detected to be in violation of this Convention, the Party carrying out the inspection may take steps to warn, detain, dismiss, or exclude the ship from its ports. A Party taking such action against a ship for the reason that the ship does not comply with this Convention shall immediately inform the Administration of the ship concerned.
(4) Parties shall co-operate in the detection of violations and the enforcement of this
Convention. A Party may also inspect a ship when it enters the ports, shipyards, or offshore terminals under its jurisdiction, if a request for an investigation is received from any Party, together with sufficient evidence that a ship is operating or has operated in violation of this Convention. The report of such investigation shall be sent to the Party requesting it and to the competent authority of the Administration of the ship concerned so that the appropriate action may be taken under this Convention.

ARTICLE 12

Violations
(1) Any violation of this Convention shall be prohibited and sanctions shall be established therefor under the law of the Administration of the ship concerned wherever the violation occurs.
If the Administration is informed of such a violation, it shall investigate the matter and may request the reporting Party to furnish additional evidence of the alleged violation. If the Administration is satisfied that sufficient evidence is available to enable proceedings to be brought in respect of the alleged violation, it shall cause such proceedings to be taken as soon as possible, in accordance with its laws. The Administration shall promptly inform the Party that reported the alleged violation, as well as the Organization, of any action taken. If the Administration has not taken any action within one year after receiving the information, it shall so inform the Party which reported the alleged violation.
Guidelines to be developed.
(2) Any violation of this Convention within the jurisdiction of any Party shall be prohibited and sanctions shall be established therefor under the law of that Party. Whenever such a violation occurs, that Party shall either:
(a) cause proceedings to be taken in accordance with its law; or
(b) furnish to the Administration of the ship concerned such information and evidence
as may be in its possession that a violation has occurred.
(3) The sanctions established under the laws of a Party pursuant to this article shall be
adequate in severity to discourage violations of this Convention wherever they occur.

it.
(b) An Administration nominating surveyors or recognizing organizations ** to
conduct surveys shall, as a minimum, empower any nominated surveyor or
recognized organization to:
(i) require a ship that it surveys to comply with the provisions of Annex 1;
and
(ii) carry out surveys if requested by the appropriate authorities of a port State
that is a Party to this Convention.
* Guidelines to be developed.
** Refer to the guidelines adopted by the Organization by resolution A.739(18), as may be amended by the

 (c) When the Administration, a nominated surveyor, or a recognized organization
determines that the ship's anti-fouling system does not conform either to the
particulars of a Certificate required under regulation 2 or 3, or to the requirements
of this Convention, such Administration, surveyor or organization shall
immediately ensure that corrective action is taken to bring the ship into
compliance. A surveyor or organization shall also in due course notify the
Administration of any such determination. If the required corrective action is not
taken, the Administration shall be notified forthwith and it shall ensure that the
Certificate is not issued or is withdrawn as appropriate.
(d) In the situation described in subparagraph (c), if the ship is in the port of another
Party, the appropriate authorities of the port State shall be notified forthwith.
When the Administration, a nominated surveyor, or a recognized organization has
notified the appropriate authorities of the port State, the Government of the port
State concerned shall give such Administration, surveyor, or organization any
necessary assistance to carry out their obligations under this regulation, including
any action described in article 11 or 12.

REGULATION 2
Issue or Endorsement of an International Anti-fouling System Certificate
(1) The Administration shall require that a ship to which regulation 1 applies is issued with a Certificate after successful completion of a survey in accordance with regulation 1. A Certificate issued under the authority of a Party shall be accepted by the other Parties and regarded for all purposes covered by this Convention as having the same validity as a Certificate issued by them.
(2) Certificates shall be issued or endorsed either by the Administration or by any person or organization duly authorized by it. In every case, the Administration assumes full responsibility for the Certificate.
(3) For ships bearing an anti-fouling system controlled under Annex 1 that was applied
before the date of entry into force of a control for such a system, the Administration shall issue a Certificate in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) of this regulation not later than two years after entry into force of that control. This paragraph shall not affect any requirement for ships to comply with Annex 1.
(4) The Certificate shall be drawn up in the form corresponding to the model given in
Appendix 1 to this Annex and shall be written at least in English, French, or Spanish. If an official language of the issuing State is also used this shall prevail in the case of the dispute or discrepancy.

REGULATION 3
Issue or Endorsement of an International Anti-fouling System Certificate by Another Party
(1) At the request of the Administration, another Party may cause a ship to be surveyed and, if satisfied that this Convention has been complied with, it shall issue or authorize the issue of a Certificate to the ship and, where appropriate, endorse or authorize the endorsement of that Certificate for the ship, in accordance with this Convention.
(2) A copy of the Certificate and a copy of the survey report shall be transmitted as soon as possible to the requesting Administration.
(3) A Certificate so issued shall contain a statement that it has been issued at the request of the Administration referred to in paragraph (1) and it shall have the same force and receive the same recognition as a Certificate issued by the Administration.
(4) No Certificate shall be issued to a ship which is entitled to fly the flag of a State which is not a Party.

REGULATION 4
Validity of an International Anti-fouling System Certificate
(1) A Certificate issued under regulation 2 or 3 shall cease to be valid in either of the
following cases:
(a) if the anti-fouling system is changed or replaced and the Certificate is not
endorsed in accordance with this Convention; and
(b) upon transfer of the ship to the flag of another State. A new Certificate shall only
be issued when the Party issuing the new Certificate is fully satisfied that the ship
is in compliance with this Convention. In the case of a transfer between Parties, if
requested within three months after the transfer has taken place, the Party whose
flag the ship was formerly entitled to fly shall, as soon as possible, transmit to the
Administration a copy of the Certificates carried by the ship before the transfer
and, if available, a copy of the relevant survey reports.
(2) The issue by a Party of a new Certificate to a ship transferred from another Party may be based on a new survey or on a valid Certificate issued by the previous Party whose flag the ship was entitled to fly.

REGULATION 5
Declaration on Anti-fouling System
(1) The Administration shall require a ship of 24 meters or more in length, but less than 400 gross tonnage engaged in international voyages and to which article 3(1)(a) applies (excluding fixed or floating platforms, FSUs, and FPSOs) to carry a Declaration signed by the owner or owner's authorized agent. Such Declaration shall be accompanied by appropriate documentation (such as a paint receipt or a contractor invoice) or contain appropriate endorsement.
(2) The Declaration shall be drawn up in the form corresponding to the model given in
Appendix 2 to this Annex and shall be written at least in English, French, or Spanish. If an official language of the State whose flag the ship is entitled to fly is also used, this shall prevail in the case of a dispute or discrepancy.
