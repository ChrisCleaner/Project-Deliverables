CONVENTION ON FUTURE MULTILATERAL CO-OPERATION IN NORTH EAST
ATLANTIC FISHERIES 

London, 18 November 1980


      The Contracting Parties,

      Noting that the coastal States of the North-East Atlantic
have, in accordance with relevant principles of international law,
extended their jurisdiction over the living resources of the
adjacent waters to limits of up to two hundred nautical miles from
the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is
measured, and exercise within these areas sovereign rights for the
purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing these
resources,

      Taking into account the work of the Third United Nations
Conference on the Law of the Sea in the field of fisheries,

      Desiring to promote the conservation and optimum utilization
of the fishery resources of the North-East Atlantic area within a
framework appropriate to the regime of extended coastal State
jurisdiction over fisheries, and accordingly to encourage
international co-operation and consultation with respect to these
resources,

      Considering that the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Convention
of 24 January 1959 should accordingly be replaced,

      Have agreed as follows:


Article 1

1.    The area to which this Convention applies, hereinafter
 referred to as "the Convention area", shall be the waters:

(a)   within those parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and their
dependent seas which lie north of 360 north latitude and between 420
west longitude and 510 east longitude, but excluding:

      (i)  the Baltic Sea and the Belts lying to the south and east
           of lines drawn from Hasenore Head to Gniben Point, from
           Korshage to Spodsbierg and from Gilbierg Head to the
           Kullen, and

      (ii) the Mediterranean Sea and its dependent seas as far as
           the point of intersection of the parallel of 360 latitude
           and the meridian of 5036' west longitude,

(b)   within that part of the Atlantic Ocean north of 590 north
latitude and between 440 west longitude and 420 west longitude.

2.    This Convention applies to all fishery resources of the
Convention area with the exception of sea mammals, sedentary
species, i.e. organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are
immobile on or under the seabed or are unable to move except in
constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil and, in so
far as they are dealt with by other international agreements, highly
migratory species and anadromous stocks.


Article 2

      Nothing in this Convention shall be deemed to affect the
rights, claims, or views of any Contracting Party with regard to the
limits or extent of jurisdiction over fisheries.


Article 3

1.    For the purposes of this Convention the Contracting Parties
agree to establish and maintain a North-East Atlantic Fisheries
Commission, hereinafter referred to as "the Commission".

2.    The Commission shall have legal personality and shall enjoy in
its relations with other international organizations and in the
territories of the Contracting Parties such legal capacity as may be
necessary to perform its functions and achieve its ends.

3.    Each Contracting Party shall appoint to the Commission not
more than two representatives who may be accompanied at any of its

two vice-presidents.

5.    The office of the Commission shall be in London.

6.    Except when the Commission determines otherwise, it shall meet
once a year in London at such time as it decides; provided, however,
that upon the request of a Contracting Party and subject to the
concurrence of three other Contracting Parties, the President shall,
as soon as practicable, convene a meeting at such time and place as
he may determine.

7.    The Commission shall appoint its own secretary and such other
staff as it may require.

8.    The Commission may set up such committees and other subsidiary
bodies as it considers desirable for the exercise of its duties and
functions.

9.    Each Contracting Party shall have one vote in the Commission.
Decisions of the Commission shall be taken by a simple majority, or,
if this Convention specifically requires a qualified majority, by a
two-thirds majority of the votes of all Contracting Parties present
and casting affirmative or negative votes, provided that no vote
shall be taken unless there is a quorum of at least two-thirds of
the Contracting Parties. If there is an even division of votes on
any matter which is subject to a simple majority decision, the
proposal shall be regarded as rejected.

10.   Subject to the provisions of this Article, the Commission
shall adopt its own Rules of Procedure including provisions for the
election of the president and vice-presidents and their terms of
office.

11.   Reports of the proceedings of the Commission shall be
transmitted as soon as possible to the Contracting Parties in
English and French.


Article 4

1.    The Commission shall perform its functions in the interests of
the conservation and optimum utilization of the fishery resources of
the Convention area and shall take into account the best scientific
evidence available to it.

exchange of information on the state of the fishery resources in the
Convention area and on management policies, including examination of
the overall effect of such policies on the fishery resources.


Article 5

1.    The Commission shall, as appropriate, make recommendations
concerning fisheries conducted beyond the areas under fisheries
jurisdiction of Contracting Parties. Such recommendations shall be
adopted by a qualified majority.

2.    The Commission in the exercise of its functions under
paragraph 1 shall seek to ensure consistency between:

(a)   any recommendation that applies to a stock or group of stocks
occurring both within an area under the fisheries jurisdiction of a
Contracting Party and beyond, or any recommendation that would have
an effect through species inter-relationships on a stock or group of
stocks occurring in whole or in part within an area under the
fisheries jurisdiction of a Contracting Party, and

(b)   any measures and decisions taken by such Contracting Party for
the management and conservation of that stock or group of stocks
with respect to fisheries conducted within the area under its
fisheries jurisdiction.

      The appropriate Contracting Party and the Commission shall
accordingly promote the co-ordination of such recommendations,
measures and decisions.

3.    For the purpose of paragraph 2 each Contracting Party shall
keep the Commission informed of its measures and decisions.

conducted beyond areas under the fisheries jurisdiction of
Contracting Parties for the purpose of ensuring the application of
this Convention and any recommendations adopted thereunder.

2.    The Commission may also make recommendations concerning
measures of control relating to fisheries conducted within an area
under the fisheries jurisdiction of a Contracting Party, provided
that the Contracting Party in question so requests and the
recommendation receives its affirmative vote.

3.    Recommendations adopted under this Article may include
provisions for termination different from those provided for in
Article 13.


Article 9

1.    The Commission may by a qualified majority make
recommendations providing for the collection of statistical

Contracting Party under the annual budgets according to the
following formula:

(a)   one-third of the budget shall be divided equally among the
Contracting Parties;

(b)   two-thirds of the budget shall be divided among the
Contracting Parties in proportion to their nominal catches in the
Convention area, on the basis of the International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea definitive catch statistics for the calendar
year ending not more than 24 and not less than 18 months before the
beginning of the budget year;

(c)   however, the annual contribution of any Contracting Party
which has a population of less than 300,000 inhabitants shall be
limited to a maximum of 5% of the total budget. When this
contribution is so limited, the remaining part of the budget shall
be divided among the other Contracting Parties in accordance with
sub-paragraphs (a) and (b). This rule shall be effective for the
first five budget years of the Commission and thereafter it shall be
subject to annual review by the Commission which may change it by a
decision adopted by a three-fourths majority of all Contracting
Parties.

5.    The Commission shall notify each Contracting Party of the
contribution due from that Party as determined under paragraph 4 and
of the date as determined by the Commission by which this
contribution shall be paid.

6.    The contribution of a Contracting Party which has acceded to
this Convention during the course of a financial year shall, in
respect of that year, be a part proportional to the number of
complete months remaining in the year of the annual contribution
calculated in accordance with paragraph 4.

7.    Contributions shall be payable in the currency of the country
in which the office of the Commission is located.

8.    A Contracting Party which has not paid by the date determined
by the Commission its contributions for two years shall not enjoy
the right of casting votes and of making objections under this
Convention until it has fulfilled its obligations, unless, at the
request of the Contracting Party concerned, the Commission decides
otherwise.

9.    The Commission shall adopt rules for the conduct of its
financial affairs.


Article 18

      By a qualified majority the Commission may sub-divide the
Convention area into regions and may alter the boundaries and vary
the number of regions provided that the decision receives the
affirmative vote of each Contracting Party exercising fisheries
jurisdiction in any part of the area affected.


Article 19

1.    Any Contracting Party may propose amendments to this
Convention. Any such proposed amendment shall be sent to the
Secretary at least 90 days prior to the meeting at which the
Contracting Party proposes it to be acted upon. The Secretary shall
transmit the proposal immediately to the Contracting Parties.

2.    The adoption of a proposed amendment requires a three-fourths
majority of all Contracting Parties. The text of any proposed
amendment so adopted shall be transmitted by the Commission to the
Depositary which shall forthwith forward it to the Contracting
Parties.

3.    An amendment shall take effect for the Contracting Parties 120
days following the date of the notification by the Depositary of
receipt of written notification of approval by three-fourths of all

Depositary of such receipt, that it objects to the amendment, in
which case the amendment shall not take effect for any Contracting
Party. A Contracting Party which has objected to an amendment may at
any time withdraw its objection. If all objections to an amendment
are withdrawn, the amendment shall take effect for the Contracting
Parties 120 days following the date of the notification by the
Depositary of receipt of the last withdrawal.
