Recognizing the importance of natural resources for present and 
future generations;

Conscious of their ever-growing value from a scientific, 
cultural, social and economic point of view;

socio-economic development is necessary for the achievement of 
conservation on a lasting basis;

Recognizing the interdependence of living resources, between 
them and with other natural resources, within ecosystems of which 
they are part;

Wishing to undertake individual and joint action for the 
conservation and management of their living resources and the 
other natural elements on which they depend;

Recognizing that international co-operation is essential to 
attain many of these goals;
