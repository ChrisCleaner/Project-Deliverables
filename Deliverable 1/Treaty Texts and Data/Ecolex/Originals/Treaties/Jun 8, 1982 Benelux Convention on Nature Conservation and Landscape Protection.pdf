BENELUX CONVENTION ON NATURE CONSERVATION AND LANDSCAPE 
PROTECTION*

[Translation by UNEP Secretariat]

Brussels, 8 June 1982


The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Government of the 
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Government of the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands,

Considering that the Third Benelux Intergovernmental Conference, 
held in Brussels on 20 and 21 October 1975, decided that, within 
the framework of an active Benelux environmental policy, nature 
conservation, the preservation of natural areas and the 
protection of landscapes of value constitute a practical 
objective,

Having regard to the advice issued on 13 December 1980 by the 
Benelux Consultative Interparliamentary Council,

Have decided to conclude a Convention to this end and have 
agreed as follows:


Article 1

1. The purpose of this Convention is to regulate concerted action 
and co-operation among the three Governments in the field of 
conservation, management and rehabilitation of the natural 
environment and landscapes.

2. For the purposes of this Convention, these terms shall have 
the following meaning:

 - natural environment: the physical surroundings of man, 
   including a-biotic (non-living) elements such as rocks, water 
   and the atmosphere and biotic (living) elements embracing 
   natural and semi-natural biocenoses including plants and 
   animals in the wild states;
 
 - natural area: an area in which the biocenoses are not, are no 
   longer, or are only slightly influenced by human action, 
   except where such action is intended to preserve or develop 
   these biocenoses;
 
 - landscape: a tangible part of the earth defined by the 
   relation and interaction of various factors: soil, relief, 
   water, climate, flora, fauna and man. Within a specified 
   landscape unit, these phenomena give rise to a pattern 
   resulting from the combination of natural, cultural, 
   historical, functional and visual aspects. The landscape may 
   be considered as a reflection of the attitude of the community 
   to its natural environment and the way in which it acts on 
   this environment;
 
 - conservation, management and rehabilitation: passive or active 
   measures intended to preserve or develop biological, cultural, 
   historical and aesthetic values;
  
 - transboundary park or area: a park or area lying across an 
   intra-Benelux border.

 
Article 2
 
 To achieve the purposes referred to in article 1, the three 
Governments agree to co-operate in the following areas:
 
1. harmonization of relevant policy principles and instruments, 
to the extent that they deem necessary, and, in particular, the 
harmonization of laws and regulations governing the subject of 
this Convention;

2. information exchange and concerted action on new measures and 
new developments to align or coordinate the policies of each of 
the three countries with regard to transboundary natural areas 
and landscapes of value;

3. organization of co-ordinated information and education 
campaigns;

4. exchange of scientific data and, as appropriate, the conduct 
of joint research;

5. co-ordinated implementation of agreements concluded within a 
wider international framework.


Article 3

 To ensure effective protection of their transboundary natural 
areas and landscapes of value, the three Governments shall 
undertake or develop the following activities:
 
1. development of protection and management concepts for 
transboundary natural areas and landscapes of value, including 
transboundary parks, as well as areas of importance for migratory 
species; definition of criteria to be fulfilled by the aforesaid 
areas, their protection and management;
 
2. establishment of an inventory, demarcation and granting of 
protective status to the areas referred to in subparagraph 1, on 
which a decision has been taken in accordance with article 1 of 
the present Convention;

3. establishment of harmonious programmes for the management and 
protection of the areas referred to in subparagraph 1, on which a 
decision has been taken in accordance with article 4 of the 
present Convention;

4. regular concerted action with a view to implementing the 
programmes referred to in subparagraph 3 above:

5. reciprocal consultation on development projects involving the 
aforesaid transboundary areas and which might adversely affect 
them.

Union and taking into account the particular circumstances of 
each country or part of a country. Such decisions shall be 
binding on the three Governments and shall be published in each 
of the three States in the form laid down for the publication of

decisions taken to implement it, subject to the prior approval of 
the Committee of Ministers recorded in a decision taken in 
conformity with article 4 of this Convention.

2. In the cases of emergency, however, and as long as there is no 
prejudice to the objectives of this Convention, each of the 
Governments may adopt and apply measures that depart from the 
provisions of this Convention, over a maximum period of three 
months, pending decision by the Committee of Ministers. The other 
Governments shall be informed of such provisional departure from 
this Convention through the Secretary-General of the Benelux

to the institution and statute of a Benelux Court of Justice, the
