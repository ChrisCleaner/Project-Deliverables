<h3>
<b><font size=-1>EMERGENCY COOPERATIVE MEASURES TO SUPPLY MUNICIPAL NEEDS<br>
OF MEXICAN COMMUNITIES LOCATED ALONG THE RIO GRANDE<br>
DOWNSTREAM OF AMISTAD DAM</font></b></h3></center>

<p><br>
<p>The Commission met at 1:00 p.m. on October 4, 1995 in the Secretariat
of Foreign Relations in Tlatelolco, D.F. to consider emergency cooperative
measures to cover needs of a domestic and municipal nature for Mexican
communities located along the Rio Grande, downstream of Amistad Dam utilizing
for this purpose, those waters that flow from the Rio Conchos to the Rio
Grande that correspond to the U.S. in accordance with the Water Treaty
of 1944, along with improvements in data gathering and distribution and
in hydrographic operations of these waters in both countries.
<p>The Commissioners referred to the diplomatic notes presented by the
Government of Mexico, in which there was outlined to the United States
Government, the critical situation prevailing in the Rio Grande Basin,
especially in the states of Chihuahua, Coahuila and Tamaulipas, where drought
has dramatically reduced inflows to the storage dams, including those corresponding
to Mexico at the International Amistad and Falcon Darns. At these international
dams, inflows are below historic minimums and threaten the water supply
for domestic uses in Mexican communities located along the Rio Grande.
In view of this the request presented by Mexico in the referenced diplomatic
notes was analyzed to cover the eventual need for such purposes.
<p>The Mexican Commissioner informed about the measures that have been
taken in his country to deal with this extreme drought situation among
which were the elimination of irrigation releases, utilization of farm
labor to rehabilitate the hydraulic/agricultural infrastructure, drilling
of wells for municipal uses and maintenance of a reserve of 150 million
cubic meters (mcm) or 121,606 acre feet (af) at the international dams
for domestic and municipal supply. He observed that Amistad Dam releases
were reduced to 10 cubic meters per second (cms) or 353 cubic feet per
second (cfs) with the corresponding release of 7 cms (247 cfs) at Falcon
Dam. The United States Commissioner informed about the measures that have
been taken in his country in managing the waters allotted to the United
States in the same period of low storage and less than normal inflows of
United States waters to the international reservoirs. He observed that
in such periods, a reserve of 278 mcm (225,000 af) is maintained at the
international dams for domestic and municipal supply.
<p>The Commissioners then reviewed the present storage corresponding to
the United States and Mexico at the Amistad and Falcon Dams. They observed
that even with recent rains, these have not been sufficient to alleviate
the situation and that even when utilizing a program of protection and
efficient use of the water, the present storage of waters belonging to
Mexico at the dams would just be sufficient to cover needs for Mexico through
June 1996. They pointed out that if significant precipitation is not experienced
during the present rainy season, inflows of Mexican water at Amistad and
Falcon Dams would not be sufficient to maintain that water supply in storage.
In such case, Mexico would face a serious threat to meeting the water supply
demands for its riverside communities. They also observed that while the
United States continues to maintain municipal and domestic needs reserve
in the international dams, amounts of authorized diversions of waters for
other uses, including irrigation, continue to be reduced.
<p>Similarly the Commissioners referred to the diplomatic note presented
by the United States Department of State which recognized the seriousness
of the situation in Mexico and provided an instruction to the United States
Commissioner to join the Mexican Commissioner in identifying the mechanisms
that would allow Mexico, in case of an urgent need, to make use of United
States waters to cover domestic and municipal use requirements in the Mexican
communities.
<p>The Commissioners referred to the powers, duties and responsibilities
given to the International Boundary and Water Commission in Articles 2,
20 and 24 of the Treaty between the United States of America and the United
Mexican States for Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers
and of the Rio Grande signed on February 3, 1944, regarding the utilization,
measurement, conveyance, storage and diversion of the waters of the Rio
Grande allotted to the United States and Mexico under this treaty.
<p>At the same time, the Commissioners observed that even though the storage
corresponding to the United States at Amistad and Falcon Dams is not in
abundance, it exceeds the stored waters available to Mexico. Thus in the
spirit of Article 9 of the 1944 Water Treaty, a framework of cooperation
between the two countries could be considered to allow Mexico to alleviate
the extreme drought that affects Mexico, giving preference to domestic
and municipal uses of the international waters in accordance to Article
3 of the 1944 Water Treaty.
<p>The Commissioners considered that in the event during 18 months after
this Minute enters into force, the combined storage of waters belonging
to Mexico in the international Amistad and Falcon reservoirs declines to
150 mcm or 121,606 af due to the continuous release of 10 cms (353 cfs)
of Mexican waters from Amistad Dam and the corresponding releases at Falcon
Dam of 7 cms (247 cfs), and inflows of waters belonging to Mexico are less
than 10 cms or 353 cfs, municipal water supplies for Mexican communities
would be seriously threatened. In such a situation, the Commissioners considered
that Mexico may divert and use waters allotted to the United States from
the Conchos River which reach the main channel of the Rio Grande up to
an amount of 100 mcm (81,071 af). However, this use by Mexico of U.S. waters
may occur only if the combined storage of waters belonging to the United
States at International Amistad and Falcon Dams is not less than 740 mcm
(600,000 af). They considered that the loan of such waters could be repaid
by Mexico in space available and belonging to the United States, after
the waters arrive at Amistad Reservoir and the combined storage of waters
belonging to Mexico in the international Amistad is greater than 200 mcm
(162,142 af) and that at Falcon is at least 50 mcm (40,536 af) and inflows
into Amistad Reservoir of waters belonging to Mexico are in excess of 10
cms (353 cfs). They considered it appropriate that at the same time the
Mexican Commissioner would notify the United States Commissioner of the
volume of waters to be released from Luis L. Leon Dam to the Conchos River,
indicating the period, release rates and the amount of waters to be utilized
by Mexico.
<p>The United States Commissioner stated that this arrangement does not
in any way represent a waiver of the rights established for the United
States in Article 4 of the Water Treaty of 1944. Further, he stated that
the repayment arrangement recognizes that current storage of United States
waters in the international Amistad and Falcon Reservoirs is below that
needed to fully satisfy demands established by applicable legislation in
the United States.
<p>The Commissioners noted the 1944 Water Treaty provisions regarding the
measurement, conveyance, storage and diversion of waters belonging to each
country. The Commissioners considered it appropriate to reinforce, at the
earliest time possible, the Commission's procedures set forth in the 1944
Water Treaty governing these activities. In this regard, the Commissioners
considered it important that the Commission ensure that only those Rio
Grande waters be diverted for which water is released for such purpose
or which belong to that country from contributions from its tributaries.
For this purpose, the United States Section would rely on the State of
Texas and the Mexican Section will utilize the Comision Nacional del Agua
(CNA) to apply the corresponding laws and regulations. At the same time
the Commission will continue to keep a record of Rio Grande waters belonging
to each country taking into account measurement of allotments and regulation
of stored waters along with withdrawals, consumptive uses, diversions and
losses.
<p>The Commissioners also observed the importance that the two countries
have given to the common interest in the conservation and storage of waters
in the international reservoirs and the maximum use of those structures
to obtain the most beneficial use of the waters belonging to each country.
They also observed that the IBWC has established a mechanism of exchanging
information regarding water management practices by competent water agencies
in the two countries. They considered it appropriate to also reinforce
this dialogue to cover information sharing and conservation measures.
<p>Based on the above, the Commissioners submit the following resolutions
for approval by the two Governments:
<dl>
<dt>
1.</dt>

<dd>
In the event, during the 18 months after this Minute enters into force,
that the combined storage of waters belonging to Mexico in the international
Amistad and Falcon reservoirs declines to 150 million cubic meters (mcm)
or 121,606 acre feet (af) and inflows of waters belonging to Mexico are
less than 10 cubic meters per second (cms) or 353 cubic feet per second
(cfs), due to continuous releases of Mexican waters of 10 cms (353 cfs)
from Amistad Dam and corresponding releases of 7 cms (247 cfs) at Falcon
Dam, and combined storage of United States waters at these dams is not
less than 740 mcm (600,000 af), Mexico may divert and use, for domestic
and municipal needs, waters allotted to the United States from the Conchos
River which reach the main channel of the Rio Grande up to an amount of
100 mcm (81,071 af) to be repaid under the terms of Resolution 2 of this
Minute and initiated under the procedures in Resolution 3 of this Minute.</dd>

<dt>
2.</dt>

<dd>
When the waters referred to in Resolution 1 have arrived at Amistad Reservoir,
and the storage belonging to Mexico in Amistad is greater than 200 mcm
(162,142 af) and at least 50 mcm (40,536 af) at Falcon Dam and inflows
into Amistad Reservoir of waters belonging to Mexico exceed 10 cms (353
cfs), the inflows in excess of this amount shall be credited to the United
States in space allotted to the United States up to the volume of United
States waters diverted and utilized by Mexico under Resolution 1 of this
Minute.</dd>

<dt>
3.</dt>

<dd>
To initiate the use of United States waters under Resolution 1 of this
Minute, the Mexican Commissioner will notify the United States Commissioner
of the volume of waters to be diverted and utilized by Mexico, as well
as the volumes of waters to be released from Luis Leon L. Dam on the Conchos
River. He will also indicate the release rates and periods.</dd>

<dt>

a waiver of the rights established for the United States in Article 4 of
the Water Treaty of 1944.</dd>

<dt>
5.</dt>

<dd>
The Commission will reinforce activities governing diversion of waters
that belong to each country, by obtaining information on the location of
authorized pumps, their capacities, and operating characteristics and updating
procedures for the joint operation of Anzalduas Dam to ensure that only
Rio Grande waters are diverted by one country if such country has released
waters for such purpose or correspond to that country in accordance to
contributions from its tributaries. For this purpose, the United States
Section will rely on the State of Texas and the Mexican Section will utilize
the Comision Nacional del Agua (CNA) to apply the corresponding laws and
regulations.</dd>

<dt>
6.</dt>

<dd>
The Commission will continue, in the earliest time possible, activities
in furtherance of the obligation in the 1944 Water Treaty that the Commission
keep a record of waters belonging to each country and those that may be
available at a given moment. This will ensure expeditious agreements on
water accounting and the availability of these data to the public in the
United States and Mexico.</dd>

<dt>
7.</dt>

<dd>
The Commission will continue its practice of exchanging information regarding
water management practices by competent water agencies in the two countries
in the interest of having basin-wide information that will enable the proper
authorities in the two countries to have the best information possible
in developing conservation and other planning strategies in the part of
the Rio Grande basin in their respective territories.</dd>
