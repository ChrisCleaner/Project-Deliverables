Administration. The Administration may, however, entrust the surveys
either to surveyors nominated for the purpose or to organizations
recognized by it.

b)    The Administration shall institute arrangements for unscheduled 
inspections to be carried out during the period of validity of the
Certificate. Such inspections shall ensure that the ship and its 
equipment remain in all respects satisfactory for the services for
which the ship is intended. These inspections may be carried out by
their own inspection services, or by nominated surveyors or by 
recognized organizations, or by other Parties upon request of the 
Administration. Where the Administration, under the provisions of
paragraph (1) of this Regulation, establishes mandatory annual
surveys, the above unscheduled inspections shall not be obligatory.

c)    An Administration nominating surveyors or the recognizing 
organizations to conduct surveys and inspections as set forth in sub-
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph, shall as a minimum  empower
any nominated surveyor or recognized organization to:

      (i)  require repairs to a ship; and

responsibilities and conditions of the authority delegated to the 
nominated surveyors or recognized organizations, for circulation to 
Parties to the present Protocol for the information of their officers.

d)    When a nominated surveyor or recognized organization determines
that the condition of the ship or its equipment does not correspond
substantially with the particulars of the Certificate or is and there
the ship is not fit to proceed to sea without presenting an
unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment, such survey or
organization shall immediately ensure that corrective action is taken
and shall in due course notify the Administration. If such corrective
action is not taken the Certificate should be withdrawn and the
Administration shall be notified immediately; and if the ship is in a
port of another Party, the appropriate authorities of the Port State
shall also be notified immediately. When an officer of the
Administration, a nominated surveyor or recognized organization has
notified the appropriate authorities of the Port State, the Government
of the Port State concerned shall give such officer, surveyor or
organization any necessary assistance to carry out their obligations
under this Regulation. When applicable, the Government of the Port
State concerned shall take such steps as will ensure that the ship
shall not sail until it can proceed to sea or leave the port for the
purpose of proceeding to the nearest appropriate repair yard available
without presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine
environment.

e)    In every case, the Administration concerned shall fully guarantee
the completeness and efficiency of the survey and inspection and shall
undertake to ensure the necessary arrangements to satisfy this
obligation.

4. a)      The condition of the ship and its equipment shall be
maintained with the provisions of the present Protocol to ensure that
the ship in all respects will remain fit to proceed to sea without
presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment.

b)    After any survey of the ship under paragraph (1) of this
Regulation has been completed, no change shall be made in the
structure, equipment, fittings, arrangements or material covered by
the survey, without the sanction of the Administration, except the
direct replacement of such equipment and fittings. 

c)    Whenever an accident occurs to a ship or a defect is discovered
which substantially affects the integrity of the ship or the
efficiency or completeness of its equipment covered by this Annex the
master or owner of the ship shall report at the earliest opportunity
to the Administration the recognized organization of the nominated
surveyor responsible for issuing the relevant Certificate, who shall
cause investigations to be initiated to determine whether a survey as
required by paragraph (i) of this Regulation is necessary. If the ship
is in port of another Party, the master or owner shall also report
immediately to the appropriate authorities of the Port State and the
nominated surveyor or recognized organization shall ascertain that
such report has been made.

c)    the International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate is
endorsed to the effect that the oil tanker is operating with special
ballast arrangements.

2.    In no case shall ballast water be carried in oil tanks except on
those rare voyages when weather conditions are so severe that, in the
opinion of the master, it is necessary to carry additional ballast
water in cargo tanks for the safety of the ship. Such additional
ballast water shall be processed and discharged in compliance with
Regulation 9 of this Annex and in accordance with the requirements of
Regulation 15 of this Annex, and entry shall be made in the Oil Record
Book referred to in Regulation 20 of this Annex.
3.              An Administration which has endorsed a Certificate in
accordance
with sub-paragraph (1)(c) of this Regulation shall communicate to the
Organization the particulars thereof for circulation to the Parties to
the present Protocol.


Regulation 13E
Protective location of segregated ballast spaces

1.    In every new crude oil tanker of 20,000 tons deadweight and above
and every new product carrier of 30,000 tons deadweight and above, the
segregated ballast tanks required to provide the capacity to comply
with the requirements of Regulation 13 of this Annex which are located
within the cargo tank length, shall be arranged in accordance with the
requirements of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of this Regulation to
provide a measure of protection against oil outflow in the event of
grounding or collision.

2.    Segregated ballast tanks and spaces other than oil tanks within
the cargo tank length (Lt) shall be so arranged as to comply with the
following requirement:

PAc + PAs J[LT + 2D)]

where:

PAc = the side shell area in square metres for each segregated ballast
tank or space other  than an oil tank based on projected moulded 
dimensions,

PAs = the bottom shell area in square metres for each such tank or
space based on projected moulded dimensions,

Lt = length in metres between the forward and after extremities of the
cargo tanks,

B = maximum breadth of the ship in metres as defined in Regulation
1(21) of this Annex,

D = moulded depth in metres measured vertically from the top of the
keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side amidships. In ships
having rounded gunwales, the moulded depth shall be measured to the
point of intersection of the moulded lines of the deck and lines
extending as though the gunwale were of angular design,

J = 0.45 for oil tankers of 20,000 tons deadweight 0.03 for oil
tankers of 200,000 tons deadweight and above, subject to the
provisions of paragraph (3) of this Regulation.
      For intermediate values of deadweight the value of J shall be
determined by linear interpolation.

      Whenever symbols given in this paragraph appear in this 
Regulation, they have the meaning as defined in this paragraph.

3.    For tankers of 200,000 tons deadweight and above the value of J
may be reduced as follows:

J  reduced  =  [J - (a - 0c + 0s)] or 0.2
                 4A
                                     whichever is greater

where:

a = 0.25 for oil tankers of 200,000 tons deadweight 
a = 0.40 for oil tankers of 300,000 tons deadweight
a = 0.50 for oil tankers of 420,000 tons deadweight and
    above,

      For intermediate values of deadweight the 'a' shall be determined
      by linear interpolation.


0c =  as defined in Regulation 23(1)(a) of this Annex,
0s =  as defined in Regulation 23(1)(b) of this Annex,

0a = the allowable oil outflow as required by Regulation 24(2) of
     this Annex.


4.    In the determination of PAc and PAs for segregated ballast tanks
and spaces and other than oil tanks the following shall apply:

a)    the minimum width of each wing tank or space either of which
extends for the full depth of the ship's side or from the deck to the
top of the double bottom shall be not less than 2 metres. The width
shall be measured inboard from the ship's side at right angles to the
centre line. Where a lesser width is provided the wing tank or space
shall not be taken into account when calculating the protecting area
PAc ; and

b)    the minimum vertical depth of each double bottom tank or space
shall be B/15 or 2 metres, whichever is the lesser. Where a lesser
depth is provided the bottom tank or space shall not be taken into
account when calculating the protecting area PAs.

      The minimum width and depth of wing tanks and double bottom tanks
shall be measured clear of the bilge area and, in the case of minimum
width, shall be measured clear of any rounded gunwale area.
