REGIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE RED SEA
AND GULF OF ADEN ENVIRONMENT 

Jeddah, 14 February 1982


      The Governments of:

the Democratic Republic of the Sudan,
the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
Palestine represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization, 
the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, 
the Somali Democratic Republic, 
the Yemen Arab Republic,

      Realizing that pollution of the marine environment in the
waters of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden by oil and other harmful or
noxious materials arising from human activities on land or at sea,
especially through indiscriminate and uncontrolled discharge of
these substances, presents a growing threat to marine life,
fisheries, human health, recreational uses of beaches and other
amenities,

      Mindful of the special hydrographic and ecological
characteristics of the marine environment of the Red Sea and Gulf of
Aden and the particular vulnerability of its coral reefs where most
biota exist,

      Conscious of the need to ensure that the processes of urban
and rural development and resultant land use should be carried out
in such a manner as to preserve, as far as possible, marine
resources and coastal amenities, and that such development should
not lead to deterioration of the marine environment,

      Convinced of the need to ensure that the processes of
industrial development should not, in any way, cause damage to the
marine environment, jeopardize its living resources or create
hazards to human health,

      Recognizing the need to develop an integrated management
approach to the use of the marine environment and the coastal areas
which will allow the achievement of environmental and development
goals in a harmonious manner,

      Recognizing also the need for a carefully planned research,
monitoring and assessment programme in view of the scarcity of
scientific information on marine pollution in the region,

      Considering that the States of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden
have a special responsibility to protect the marine environment of
the region,

      Aware of the importance of co-operation and co-ordination of
action on a regional basis with the aim of protecting the marine
environment of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for the benefit of all
concerned, including future generations,

      Bearing in mind the existing international conventions
