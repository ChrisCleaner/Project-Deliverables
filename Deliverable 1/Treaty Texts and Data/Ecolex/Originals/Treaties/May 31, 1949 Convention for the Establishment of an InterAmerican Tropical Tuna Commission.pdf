CONVENTION FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTER-AMERICAN TROPICAL TUNA
COMMISSION

Adopted at Washington on 31 May 1949


     The United States of America and the Republic of Costa Rica
considering their mutual interest in maintaining the populations of
yellowfin and skipjack tuna and of other kinds of fish taken by tuna
fishing vessels in the eastern Pacific Ocean which by reason of
continued use have come to be of common concern and desiring to co-
operate in the gathering and interpretation of factual information to
facilitate maintaining the populations of these fishes at a level which
will permit maximum sustained catches year after year, have agreed to
conclude a Convention for these purposes and to that end have named as
their Plenipotentiaries:

who, having communicated to each other their full powers, found to be
in good and due form, have agreed as follows:

1. Make investigations concerning the abundance, biology, biometry, and
ecology of yellowfin (Neothunnus) and skipjack (Kaisuwonus) tuna in the
