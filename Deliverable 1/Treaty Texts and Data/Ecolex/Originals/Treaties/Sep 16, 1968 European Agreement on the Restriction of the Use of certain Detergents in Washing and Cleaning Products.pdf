EUROPEAN AGREEMENT ON THE RESTRICTION OF THE USE OF CERTAIN 
DETERGENTS IN WASHING AND CLEANING PRODUCTS 

Adopted at Strasbourg on 16 September 1968


 The Governments of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of 
Denmark, the French Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, 
the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom 
of the Netherlands, the Swiss Confederation and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,

Considering that the Parties to the Brussels Treaty of 17 March 
1948, as amended on 23 October 1954, resolved to strengthen the 
social ties by which they are united and to make every effort in 
common, both by direct consultation and in specialized Agencies, 
to raise the standards of living of their peoples and promote the 
harmonious development of social services in their respective 
countries;

Considering that the social activities governed by the Brussels 
Treaty and carried on, until 1959, under the auspices of the 
Brussels Treaty Organization and the Western European Union are 
now conducted within the framework of the Council of Europe, in 
accordance with the decision taken on 21 October 1959 by the 
Council of Western European Union and with Resolution (59) 23 
adopted on 16 November 1959 by the Committee of Ministers of the 
Council of Europe;

 Considering that the Swiss Confederation and the Kingdom of 
Denmark have participated since 6 May 1964 and 2 April 1968 
respectively in activities in the field of public health carried 
on under the aforesaid resolution;

Whereas the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve greater 
unity between its Members, so as to further economic and social 
progress by Agreements and by common action in economic, social, 
cultural, scientific, legal and administrative matters;

Whereas the said Governments have striven to encourage progress 
as far as may be practicable not only in social matters but in 
the related field of public health, and have undertaken to 
harmonise their national legislations in pursuance of the action 
mentioned in the foregoing paragraph;

Whereas it is becoming increasingly necessary to secure 
harmonisation of the laws on the control of fresh water 
pollution;

Being convinced that appropriate measures are essential not only 
from the standpoint of human needs but also to ensure the 
protection of nature in general, the paramount objectives being 
to protect effectively;

a) the supply of water for the population, for industry, for 
agriculture and for other business occupations;

b) the natural aquatic fauna and flora, and in particular so far 
as they contribute to human well-being;

c) the unhindered enjoyment of places devoted to leisure and 
sport;

Observing that the general household and industrial use of 
certain types of detergents might cause considerable prejudice to 
these interests;

Feeling, therefore, that some restriction must be put on the use 
of such products,

market unless the detergents in the product considered are as a

implemented in their respective territories to guarantee 
compliance with the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this
