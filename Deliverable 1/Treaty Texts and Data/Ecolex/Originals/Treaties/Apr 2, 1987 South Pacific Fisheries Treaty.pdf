Desiring to promote regional co-operation and co-ordination in respect of fisheries policies; 

Bearing in mind recent developments in the law of the sea; 

Concerned to secure the maximum benefits from the living marine resources of the region for their peoples and for the region as a whole and in particular the developing countries; and 

Desiring to facilitate the collection, analysis, evaluation and dissemination of relevant statistical scientific and economic information about the living marine resources of the region, and in particular the highly migratory species;
