CONVENTION ON THE PHYSICAL PROTECTION OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL 

Vienna and New York, 3 March 1980


    The States Parties to this Convention,

    Recognizing the right of all States to develop and apply nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes and their legitimate interests in the
potential benefits to be derived from the peaceful application of
nuclear energy,

    Convinced of the need for facilitating international co-operation
in the peaceful application of nuclear energy,

    Desiring to avert the potential dangers posed by the unlawful
taking and use of nuclear material,

    Convinced that offences relating to nuclear material are a matter
of grave concern and that there is an urgent need to adopt appropriate
and effective measures to ensure the prevention, detection and
punishment of such offenses,

    Aware of the need for international co-operation to establish,
in conformity with the national law of each State Party and with this
Convention, effective measures for the physical protection of nuclear
material,

    Convinced that this Convention should facilitate the safe
transfer of nuclear material,

    Stressing also the importance of the physical protection of
nuclear material in domestic use, storage and transport,

    Recognizing the importance of effective physical protection of
nuclear material used for military purposes, and understanding that
such material is and will continue to be accorded stringent physical
protection.

    Have agreed as follows:


Article 1

    For the purposes of this Convention:

(a) "Nuclear material" means plutonium except that with isotopic
concentration exceeding 80% in plutonium-238; uranium-233; uranium
enriched in the isotope 235 or 233; uranium containing the mixture of
isotopes as occurring in nature other than in the form of ore or ore-
residue; any material containing one or more of the foregoing;

(b) "Uranium enriched in the isotope 235 or 233" means uranium
containing the isotope 235 or 233 or both in an amount such that the
abundance ratio of the sum of these isotopes to the isotope 238 is
greater than the ratio of the isotope 235 to the isotope 238 occurring
in nature;

(c) "International nuclear transport" means the carriage of a
consignment of nuclear material by any means of transportation intended
to go beyond the territory of the State where the shipment originates
beginning with the departure from a facility of the shipper in that
State and ending with the arrival at a facility of the receiver within
the State of ultimate destination.


Article 2

1.  This Convention shall apply to nuclear material used for peaceful
purposes while in international nuclear transport.

2.  With the exception of articles 3 and 4 and paragraph 3 of article
5, this Convention shall also apply to nuclear material used for
peaceful purposes while in domestic use, storage and transport.

3.  Apart from the commitments expressly undertaken by States Parties
in the articles covered by paragraph 2 with respect to nuclear material
used for peaceful purposes while in domestic use, storage and
transport, nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as affecting
the sovereign rights of a State regarding the domestic use, storage and
transport of such nuclear material.


Article 3

    Each State Party shall take appropriate steps within the
framework of its national law and consistent with international law to
ensure as far as practicable that, during international nuclear
transport, nuclear material within its territory, or on board a ship
or aircraft under its jurisdiction insofar as such ship or aircraft is
engaged in the transport to or from that State, is protected at the
levels described in Annex I.


Article 4

1.  Each State Party shall not export or authorize the export of
nuclear material unless the State Party has received assurances that
such material will be protected during the international nuclear
transport at the levels described in Annex I.

2.  Each State Party shall not import or authorize the import of
nuclear material from a State not party to this Convention unless the
State Party has received assurances that such material will during the
international nuclear transport be protected at the levels described
in Annex I.

3.  A State Party shall not allow the transit of its territory by
land or internal waterways or through its airports or seaports of
nuclear material between States that are not parties to this Convention
unless the State Party has received assurances as far as practicable
that this nuclear material will be protected during international
nuclear transport at the levels described in Annex I.

4.  Each State Party shall apply within the framework of its national
law the levels of physical protection described in Annex I to nuclear
material being transported from a part of that State to another part
of the same State through international waters or airspace.

5.  The State Party responsible for receiving assurances that the
nuclear material will be protected at the levels described in Annex I
according to paragraphs 1 to 3 shall identify and inform in advance
States which the nuclear material is expected to transit by land or
internal waterways, or whose airports or seaports it is expected to
enter.

6.  The responsibility for obtaining assurances referred to in
paragraph 1 may be transferred, by mutual agreement, to the State Party
involved in the transport as the importing State.

7.  Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as in any way
affecting the territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction of a State,
including that over its airspace and territorial sea.


Article 5

1.  States Parties shall identify and make known to each other
directly or through the International Atomic Energy Agency their
central authority and point of contact having responsibility for
physical protection of nuclear material and for co-ordinating recovery
and response operations in the event of any unauthorized removal, use
or alteration of nuclear material or in the event of credible threat
thereof.

2.  In the case of theft, robbery or any other unlawful taking of
nuclear material or of credible threat thereof, States Parties shall,
in accordance with their national law, provide co-operation and
assistance to the maximum feasible extent in the recovery and
protection of such material to any State that so requests. In
particular:

(a) A State Party shall take appropriate steps to inform as soon as
possible other States, which appear to it to be concerned, of any
theft, robbery or other unlawful taking of nuclear material or credible
threat thereof and to inform, where appropriate, international
organizations;

(b) As appropriate, the States Parties concerned shall exchange
information with each other or international organizations with a view
to protecting threatened nuclear material, verifying the integrity of
the shipping container, or recovering unlawfully taken nuclear material
and shall:

their grave nature.


Article 8

1.  Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to
establish its jurisdiction over the offences set forth in Article 7 in
the following cases:

(a) when the offence is committed in the territory of that State or
on board a ship or aircraft registered in that State;

(b) when the alleged offender is a national of that State.

2.  Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be
necessary to establish its jurisdiction over these offenses in cases
where the alleged offender is present in its territory and it does not
extradite him pursuant to Article 11 to any of the States mentioned in
paragraph 1.

3.  This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction
exercised in accordance with national law.

4.  In addition to the States Parties mentioned in paragraphs 1 and
2, each State Party may, consistent with international law, establish
its jurisdiction over the offenses set forth in Article 7 when it is
involved in international nuclear transport as the exporting or
importing State.


Article 9

    Upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, the State
Party in whose territory the alleged offender is present shall take
appropriate measures, including detention, under its national law to
ensure his presence for the purpose of prosecution or extradition.
Measures taken according to this article shall be notified without
delay to the States required to establish jurisdiction pursuant to
Article 8 and, where appropriate, all other States concerned.


Article 10

    The State Party in whose territory the alleged offender is
present shall, if it does not extradite him submit, without exception
whatsoever and without undue delay, the case to its competent
authorities for the purpose of prosecution, through proceedings in
accordance with the laws of that State.


Article 11

1.  The offenses in Article 7 shall be deemed to be included as
extraditable offenses in any extradition treaty existing between States
Parties. States Parties undertake to include those offences as
extraditable offences in every future extradition treaty to be
concluded between them.

2.  If a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the
existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another
State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may at its
option consider this Convention as the legal basis for extradition in
respect of those offences. Extradition shall be subject to the other
conditions provided by the law of the requested State.

3.  States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the
existence of a treaty shall recognize those offenses as extraditable
offences between themselves subject to the conditions provided by the
law of the requested State.

4.  Each of the offences shall be treated, for the purpose of
extradition between States Parties, as if it had been committed not
only in the place in which it occurred but also in the territories of
the States Parties required to establish their jurisdiction in
accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 8.


Article 12

    Any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in
connection with any of the offences set forth in Article 7 shall be
guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings.


Article 13

1.  States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of
assistance in connection with criminal proceedings brought in respect
of the offences set forth in Article 7, including the supply of
evidence at their disposal necessary for the proceedings. The law of
the State requested shall apply in all cases.

2.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not affect obligations under
any other treaty, bilateral or multilateral, which governs or will
govern, in whole or in part, mutual assistance in criminal matters.


Article 14

1.  Each State Party shall inform the depositary of its laws and
regulations which give effect to this Convention. The depositary shall
communicate such information periodically to all States Parties.

2.  The State Party where an alleged offender is prosecuted shall,
wherever practicable, first communicate the final outcome of the
proceedings to the States directly concerned. The State Party shall
also communicate the final outcome to the depositary who shall inform
all States.

3.  Where an offence involves nuclear material used for peaceful
purposes in domestic use, storage or transport, and both the alleged
offender and the nuclear material remain in the territory of the State
Party in which the offence was committed, nothing in this Convention
shall be interpreted as requiring that State Party to provide
information concerning criminal proceedings arising out of such an
offence.


Article 15

    The Annexes constitute an integral part of this Convention.


Article 16

1.  A conference of States Parties shall be convened by the
depositary five years after the entry into force of this Convention to
review the implementation of the Convention and its adequacy as
concerns the preamble, the whole of the operative part and the annexes

2.  Any dispute of this character which cannot be settled in the
manner prescribed in paragraph 1 shall, at the request of any party to
such dispute, be submitted to arbitration or referred to the
International Court of Justice for decision. Where a dispute is
submitted to arbitration, if, within six months from the date of the
request, the parties to the dispute are unable to agree on the
organization of the arbitration, a party may request the President of
the International Court of Justice or the Secretary-General of the
United Nations to appoint one or more arbitrators. In case of
conflicting requests by the parties to the dispute, the request to the
Secretary-General of the United Nations shall have priority.

3.  Each State Party may at the time of signature, ratification,
acceptance or approval of this Convention or accession thereto declare
that it does not consider itself bound by either or both of the dispute
settlement procedures provided for in paragraph 2. The other States
Parties shall not be bound by a dispute settlement procedure provided
for in paragraph 2, with respect to a State Party which has made a
