The United Nations Environment Assembly,    Noting  the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which confirms that climate systems are warming and that global temperatures will continue to rise in the coming decades, if not centuries, even if emissions of greenhouse gases are stabilized, affecting natural systems on which humanity relies and highlighting the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change,   Noting also  General Assembly resolution 67/210, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, expressed deep concern that all countries, particularly developing countries, are vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and are already experiencing increased impacts, including persistent drought and extreme weather events, sea-level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, further threatening food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and emphasized that adaptation to climate change represents an immediate and urgent global priority,   Recalling  paragraph 190 of the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe future we want\xe2\x80\x9d,1 in which Heads of State and Government expressed concern that all countries are already experiencing the adverse impacts of climate change, which is threatening efforts to achieve sustainable development, eradicate poverty and achieve food security, and emphasized that adaptation to climate change is an immediate and urgent priority,   Mindful  of decision X/33 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, in which parties and other Governments were invited, in accordance with national capacities and circumstances, to integrate ecosystem-based approaches for adaptation into relevant strategies, including adaptation strategies and plans, national action plans to combat desertification, national biodiversity strategies and action plans, poverty reduction strategies, disaster risk reduction strategies and sustainable land management strategies on biodiversity and climate change and the role of ecosystem-based adaptation highlighted therein, and decision XI/15, in which parties were called on to mainstream ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change, ecosystem restoration and invasive species management for human health and well-being into all island development and conservation plans and projects and build capacity in their application, inviting organizations, including the United Nations Environment Programme, to support ecosystem-based adaptation,   Mindful also  of the work of the Nairobi Work Programme of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the process to support the formulation and implementation of national adaptation plans,   Acknowledging  the dependence of all countries, particularly developing countries, on ecosystems for livelihoods, food production and well-being, including adaptation to the impacts of climate change,   Noting  the United Nations Environment Programme technical report Africa\xe2\x80\x99s Adaptation Gap, which indicates that climate change will affect, among other sectors, biodiversity, water supply, human health and food production, and that it is likely to increase the number of people at risk of hunger as well as the proportion of malnourished people in a region where 22 per cent of the population already suffers from hunger,   Bearing in mind  that adaptation and mitigation actions generate multiple co-benefits,   Noting with concern that the resilience of many ecosystems is already being exceeded by an unprecedented combination of climate change, associated disturbances and other drivers,     Recognizing  the adverse impacts of climate change, among other drivers, on ecosystems and on their ability to meet the needs for local food production and national food security and, inter alia, water resources,     Conscious  of the heightened vulnerability of developing countries, particularly the least-developed countries and the small island developing States, to the impacts of climate change,     Recognizing  that ecosystem-based approaches should contribute to climate resilient sustainable development in synergy with other adaptation-relevant approaches in all sectors,     Recognizing also  the sovereignty and stewardship of all countries over their ecosystems and natural resources, which are threatened by climate change and other drivers,     Recalling  Governing Council decision 22/3, in which the Council decided that the United Nations Environment Programme should strengthen its role, within available resources and in the light of its programme of work, to support regional and national actions and programmes to reduce the vulnerability of developing countries to climate change,     Recognizing  the ongoing work of the United Nations Environment Programme on ecosystem-based adaptation activities to reduce vulnerability to climate change and subsequent vulnerabilities in areas such as food security, water, health or biodiversity,     Recognizing also  the role of civil society, scientific institutions and other relevant stakeholders in providing, inter alia, evidence, tools, case studies, monitoring and best practices in ecosystem-based adaptation,     Recognizing further  the need to take into consideration the needs of and engage vulnerable groups and communities in the implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation measures,    1.  Requests  the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, in partnership with Governments, scientific institutions, United Nations agencies, civil society and other relevant stakeholders, within available resources and in the light of its programme of work, to continue providing and enhance support to developing countries, at their request, for the development and implementation of community-based, national and regional ecosystem-based adaptation programmes and activities through, inter alia, practical tools and pilot projects to demonstrate the use of those tools and other policymaking technical support;    2.  Encourages  all countries to include and improve ecosystem-based adaptation and community-based adaptation in their national policies, including those on climate change adaptation, food security and sustainable management of forests, according to their national circumstances and priorities;    3. Invites  all countries, in the formulation and implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation and community-based adaptation measures, to consider in an integrated manner indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including, where appropriate, indigenous and local communities\xe2\x80\x99 holistic view of community and environment, as a major resource for adapting to climate change;    4.  Also invites  all countries to take into consideration ecosystems in their development planning for all relevant sectors, including in their climate change adaptation policies and plans;    5.  Requests  the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme to continue its collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme and other relevant institutions and organizations to integrate ecosystems as a key element in national adaptation planning processes, according to the guidelines of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, taking into account guidance developed under the Convention on Biological Diversity;    6.  Calls upon  countries in position to do so to continue to support the development and implementation of programmes, projects and development policies for adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change that take into account ecosystems, especially of developing countries at their request;    7.  Requests  the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme to report to the United Nations Environment Assembly at its second session on progress in the implementation of the present resolution.
