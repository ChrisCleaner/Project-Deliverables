We support international cooperation with a view to conserving coral reef and mangrove ecosystems and realizing their social, economic and environmental benefits as well as facilitating technical collaboration and voluntary information-sharing\xe2\x80\x9d,   Considering  the World Food Summit Plan of Action adopted in Rome in 1996, as well as the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security identified in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security of 2009,   Also considering  Aichi Biodiversity Target, 10 which aims to minimize the multiple anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs and other vulnerable ecosystems impacted by climate change or ocean acidification so as to maintain their integrity and functioning, and deeply concerned that the 2015 deadline has not been met,   Bearing in mind  the outcome document of the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cTransforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\xe2\x80\x9d, in particular paragraph 14 which, inter alia, acknowledges that increases in global temperatures, sea level rise, ocean acidification and other climate change impacts are seriously affecting coastal areas and low-lying coastal countries, including many least developed countries and small island developing States, and also bearing in mind Sustainable Development Goal 14,   Recalling  that United Nations General assembly resolution 65/150 reaffirms that the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides the overall legal framework for ocean activities, and emphasizes its fundamental character, conscious that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole through an integrated, interdisciplinary and intersectoral approach,   Acknowledging  the Manado Ocean Declaration, adopted by the World Ocean Conference on 14 May 2009, and the Jakarta Mandate on Marine and Coastal Biological Diversity of 1995 as well as decision XII/23 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity,   Recognizing  the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities as well as the International Coral Reef Initiative Continuing Call to Action and Framework for Action 2013, which provide a meaningful basis for advancing ocean issues, as well as other international and/or regional organizations related to the management of ocean and marine biodiversity,   Recalling  the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) resolution adopted in October 2014 on promoting an integrated approach to community-based coral reefs conservation and management emphasizing land-sea connectivity,   Noting  the Manado Communiqu\xc3\xa9, adopted at the World Coral Reefs Conference on 16 May 2014, which recognized the importance of continued cooperation among Governments and the United Nations Environment Programme as well as with other international organizations, non-governmental organizations, the private sector and communities, toward the sustainable management of coral reefs, and that such cooperation may be advanced by countries through the United Nations Environment Assembly,   Recognizing  that millions of the world\xe2\x80\x99s inhabitants depend on the health of coral reefs, mangrove forests and related ecosystems for sustainable livelihoods and development, as they are a primary source of food and income, add to the aesthetic and cultural dimensions of communities and also provide protection from storms, tsunamis and coastal erosion,   Welcoming  regional cooperation and initiatives, including the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security; the Micronesia Challenge; the Caribbean Challenge; the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape project; the Western Indian Ocean Partnership; the West African Conservation Challenge and the Regional Initiative for the Conservation and Wise Use of Mangroves and Corals for the Americas Region,  1.  Calls  for national, regional and international initiatives, cooperation and commitments, to conserve and sustainably manage coral reefs, including cold-water coral ecosystems, and mangrove forests, that contribute to food security and nutrition for peoples\xe2\x80\x99 livelihoods;  2.  Stresses  the need for developing environmentally sustainable economic opportunities and inclusive sustainable growth to improve the livelihoods of the local community-level beneficiaries of coral reefs;  3.  Recognizes  that education, capacity-building and knowledge transfer on the importance of coral reefs and related ecosystems, including cold-water coral ecosystems and mangrove forests, the threats to these ecosystems and recommended measures to ensure their protection and sustainable use, are crucial and invites Governments in a position to do so to support such action;  4.  Encourages  Governments to further develop partnerships with industry, including fisheries, aquaculture and tourism, and civil society, and the establishment of public-private partnerships, to raise awareness of the importance of coral reefs and related ecosystems, including cold-water coral ecosystems and mangrove forests, the threats to these ecosystems and recommended measures to ensure their protection and sustainable use; and encourages Governments to cooperate on the protection and sustainable management of these ecosystems; and invites in this regard initiatives for the development of sustainable tourism, including through the United Nations Environment Programme Global Programme on Sustainable Tourism;  5.  Also encourages  Governments to formulate, adopt and implement integrated, ecosystem-based and comprehensive approaches for the sustainable management of coral reefs, cold-water coral ecosystems, mangrove forests and related ecosystems;  6.
