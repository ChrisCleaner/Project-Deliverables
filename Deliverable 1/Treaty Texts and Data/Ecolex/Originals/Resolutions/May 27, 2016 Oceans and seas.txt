The United Nations Environment Assembly,     Recognizing  that the marine environment, including the oceans, seas and adjacent coastal areas, forms an integrated whole that is an essential component of the global life-support system and an asset presenting important opportunities for sustainable development,   Gravely concerned  about threats to the health of our oceans, coastal areas, wetlands and islands, as reflected, inter alia, in the first global integrated marine assessment (World Ocean Assessment I) of the Regular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic Aspects, acknowledged in General Assembly resolution 70/235, the fourth Global Biodiversity Outlook report and chapter 30 of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and about their probable increase in the foreseeable future,   Recalling  that United Nations General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, calls for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in UNCLOS, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of \xe2\x80\x9cThe future we want\xe2\x80\x9d,   Also recalling  General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, by which the Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and welcoming the inclusion therein of Sustainable Development Goal 14 and its commitment on the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, while recognizing also the connections between healthy and productive oceans and other Sustainable Development Goals,   Further recalling  General Assembly resolution 70/226 of 22 December 2015 \xe2\x80\x98United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development\xe2\x80\x99, and welcoming in particular the decision therein to convene the high-level conference in Fiji in June 2017,   Recognizing  the contribution in accordance with international law of the regional seas conventions, regional action plans and regional fisheries management organizations in achieving SDG 14 and relevant related Sustainable Development Goals at the regional level, as well as to their regional follow-up and review, including through the regional monitoring and reporting mechanisms to be developed for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda,   Also recognizing  the important contribution of many multilateral environmental agreements to delivering on the oceans-related Sustainable Development Goals and contributing to their follow-up and review processes,   Recalling  that the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe future we want\xe2\x80\x9d, reaffirmed the commitment contained in Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 on area-based conservation measures, including marine protected areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information as a tool for the conservation of biological diversity and sustainable use of its components and that target 14.5 of the Sustainable Development Goals calls for, by 2020, the conservation of at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas,   Also recalling  the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\xe2\x80\x932020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and noting with concern the assessment in the fourth Global Biodiversity Outlook report that while there is significant progress towards meeting some components of the majority of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, the rate of progress in most cases will not be sufficient to achieve the targets by 2020 unless additional action is taken,   Further recalling  the United Nations Environment Programme Governing Council decision 27/6 on oceans, which urged countries to take the necessary steps to implement relevant and existing commitments, as well as commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, to protect and restore the health, productivity and resilience of oceans and marine ecosystems and to maintain biodiversity, and to effectively apply an ecosystem approach and the precautionary approach in their management, in accordance with international law, of activities having an impact on the marine environment in order to deliver on all three dimensions of sustainable development,   Acknowledging  the United Nations Environment Programme\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to tackling of emerging issues and activities adding to pressure on the marine environment, and to increasing knowledge on issues such as marine litter, ocean acidification, hypoxia and marine and coastal carbon sinks and reservoirs,   Recognizing  the contribution of area-based management measures for the conservation of biological diversity and sustainable use of its components under international instruments, such as particularly sensitive sea areas established by the International Maritime Organization and vulnerable marine ecosystems identified by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the work on marine protected areas under the regional seas conventions and action plans or other area-based management measures taken by regional fisheries management organizations, to reach the target of Sustainable Development Goal 14 by 2020 to conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas consistent with national and international law and based on best available scientific information, and acknowledging related scientific and technical work on ecologically or biologically significant marine areas under the Convention on Biological Diversity and other global initiatives,   Welcoming  the Paris Agreement adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as a crucial step towards limiting the climate change-related impacts of warming and acidification of the oceans and of sea-level rise, and reduce the adverse consequences for marine and coastal ecosystems and coastal residents worldwide and including for small island developing States and other vulnerable States,   Recalling  General Assembly resolution 69/292 of 19 June 2015, on the development of an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction,   Taking into account  the contribution which the United Nations Environment Programme can make upon request by the concerned State(s) to assist them in the protection and preservation of the marine environment including in helping to achieve their objectives under relevant international law,   Acknowledging  the challenges involved in enhancing cooperation and coordination among international organizations and forums relevant to marine issues, and highlighting the value in UNEP \xe2\x80\x98s cooperation and coordination with these organizations and fora to contribute to a coherent delivery of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,   Recalling  the three priority source categories for work
