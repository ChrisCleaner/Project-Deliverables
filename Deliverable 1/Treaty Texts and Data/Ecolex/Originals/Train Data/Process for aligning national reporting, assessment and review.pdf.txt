CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE
 CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY
Fourteenth meeting
Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, 17-29 November 2018
Agenda item 12

DECISION ADOPTED BY THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION ON
                         BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY
                 14/27. Process for aligning national reporting, assessment and review
        The Conference of the Parties,
        Emphasizing the value of improving the alignment of national reports under the Convention and its
Protocols in order to reduce reporting burdens,
         Also emphasizing the value of enhanced synergies among the biodiversity-related conventions and
the Rio conventions, and noting the progress made thus far in this respect, including the activities of the
Liaison Group of Biodiversity-related Conventions and the Joint Liaison Group of the Rio Conventions, as
well as relevant initiatives such as the development of the Data and Reporting Tool under InforMEA,
       Recognizing the potential of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework in facilitating the
alignment of national reporting under the Convention and its Protocols,
        Also recognizing that the Convention and each of the Protocols are distinct legal instruments with
specific obligations on their Parties, and that the information provided in the national reporting formats
depends on the focus and goals of implementation strategies adopted under each instrument at a given time,
         Noting the continued need for capacity-building and financial support for developing countries, in
particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, and countries with economies in
transition, for future reporting cycles under the Convention and its Protocols,
         1.        Decides to commence with synchronized reporting cycles for the Convention, the Cartagena
Protocol and the Nagoya Protocol in 2023, and invites the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting
of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties
to the Nagoya Protocol to undertake the preparatory measures necessary for the realization of such
synchronized reporting approaches and cycles;
        2.       Encourages Parties to explore possible synergies at the national level, involving all relevant
biodiversity-related reporting processes, in order to enhance the alignment and consistency of information
and data in national reports;
        3.       Requests the Executive Secretary:
         (a)     To assess the cost implications of the synchronized reporting cycles for the Convention, the
Cartagena Protocol and the Nagoya Protocol starting in 2023 in order to inform the Global Environment
Facility in connection with the preparation for the replenishment of the Trust Fund for the 2022-2026 cycle;

        (b)      To continue making efforts to improve and harmonize the user interface and the design of
national reporting, including the online reporting tool, under the Convention and its Protocols, and to report
to the Subsidiary Body on Implementation at its third meeting on the progress made;
       (c)      To draw upon experiences and lessons learned from the most recent reports of Parties to the
Convention and to the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols, in particular with respect to facilitating the further
alignment of reporting processes;
        (d)   To identify, when preparing documentation related to the post-2020 global biodiversity
framework, any implications and options for aligning national reporting under the Convention and its
Protocols;
        (e)     To identify, in consultation with related convention secretariats, the Liaison Group of
Biodiversity-related Conventions and the Joint Liaison Group of the Rio Conventions and, on the basis of
suggestions from the informal advisory group on synergies among the biodiversity-related conventions,
concrete actions to advance synergies on reporting, inter alia, through:
           (i)       Common indicators, where appropriate;
           (ii)      Reporting modules on shared issues;
           (iii)     Interoperability of information management and reporting systems;
           (iv)      Other options for increasing synergies in national reporting among the biodiversity-related
                     conventions and the Rio conventions;
and assess the financial implications of such actions, and to report to the Subsidiary Body on Implementation
at its third meeting;
       (f)    To continue to contribute to the monitoring process for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development1 and to explore synergies with the related reporting systems and tools for the Sustainable
Development Goals, including with regard to methodological approaches;
        (g)      To contribute to the development, testing and promotion of the Data and Reporting Tool, in
collaboration with the InforMEA Initiative, taking into account the experiences of Parties in preparing their
sixth national reports to the Convention, with a view to facilitating the use of the Data and Reporting Tool
across the biodiversity-related conventions, as appropriate;
        (h)      To evaluate the use by the Parties of online reporting tools for the sixth national report, the
interim national report for the Nagoya Protocol and the national report for the Cartagena Protocol, to explore
harmonization with the reporting systems used by related convention secretariats, and to report to the
Subsidiary Body on Implementation at its third meeting;
       (i)     To continue providing capacity-building on the use of tools for the preparation and
submission of national reports;
         (j)      To provide, in collaboration with relevant partners, guidance to Parties on sources of
spatio-temporal data on biodiversity to support the analyses underlying the assessments of progress in
national reports.
