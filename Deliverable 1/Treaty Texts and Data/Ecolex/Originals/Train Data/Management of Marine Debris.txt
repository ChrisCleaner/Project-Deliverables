                                  MANAGEMENT OF MARINE DEBRIS

        Adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its 12th Meeting (Manila, October 2017)


Recalling CMS Resolution 10.4 on Marine Debris and Resolution 11.30 on Management of
Marine Debris1 and reiterating the concern that marine debris has negative impacts on many
species of migratory marine wildlife and their habitats,

Concerned that marine debris, including abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear
(ALDFG) and microplastics, negatively impacts substantial numbers of migratory marine
animals, including many species of birds, turtles, sharks and marine mammals that are
threatened with extinction,

Aware that entanglement in and ingestion of marine debris are both conservation and welfare
concerns,

Also aware that microplastics have the potential of increasing the bioavailability of toxic
substances to marine organisms, which may have impacts on all parts of the marine food chain,

Noting that concerted effort needs to be made in upstream locations and estuaries and other
systems where marine debris can enter the marine and coastal environment and impact upon
migratory species listed under the Convention,

Welcoming United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) Resolution 1/6 on Marine Plastic
Debris and Micro Plastics (2014), and Resolution 2/11 on Marine Plastic Litter and
Microplastics (2016),

Recalling that in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable
Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, entitled The Future We Want, States
committed “to take action to, by 2025, based on collected scientific data, achieve significant
reductions in marine debris to prevent harm to the coastal and marine environment”,




1   Both now consolidated as Resolution 12.20
 UNEP/CMS/Resolution 12.20



Recalling the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development adopted in September 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly, and
especially Goal 14 to Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources,
which includes the following targets:
   • By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from
        land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution,
   • By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid
        significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action
        for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans,
   • Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine
        technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission’s
        Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve
        ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development
        of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least
        developed countries,

Welcoming the G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter as adopted by the G20 Leaders on 8 July
2017,

Recognizing Resolution 60/30, Oceans and the law of the sea, adopted by the United Nations
General Assembly, which emphasizes the importance of protecting and preserving the marine
environment and its living marine resources against pollution and physical degradation,

Acknowledging the substantial work on this subject being undertaken by other regional and
global instruments, including inter alia the United Nations Environment Programme Global
Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based Activities
(GPA-Marine), the Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans (RSCAPs), the Global
Partnership on Marine Litter (GPML), the Global Partnership on Waste Management (GPWM),

International Maritime Organization (IMO), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the
International Whaling Commission (IWC), the London Convention, London Protocol, the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO),
and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles,

Further acknowledging actions undertaken by States to reduce the negative impacts of marine
debris in waters within their jurisdiction,

Noting the formulation of the Honolulu Commitment and the development of the Honolulu
Strategy which aims to reduce the impacts of marine debris over the next ten years,

Noting with gratitude that the extensive reviews called for in CMS Resolution 10.42 have been
carried out with financial support from the Government of Australia,

Recognizing that information on marine debris remains incomplete, especially regarding the
quantity present in the ocean and entering the ocean annually, as well as its sources,
pathways, prevalence in different sea compartments, and fate in terms of fragmentation,
decomposition, distribution and accumulation,

Concerned that currently available information is not sufficient in order to generally understand
which populations and species are the most affected by marine debris, especially the specific
effects of marine debris on migratory as opposed to resident species, and that population level
effects of marine debris are unknown in many cases,

Emphasizing that preventing waste from reaching the marine environment is the most effective
way to address this problem, and that moving to a more circular economy reducing the amount
of waste generated is the only sustainable solution,

Recognizing the key role of industry and Governments in establishing a circular economy that
prevents waste and implementing actions that eliminate sources of marine debris,

Further emphasizing that despite the knowledge gaps relating to marine debris and its impacts
on migratory marine wildlife, there is clear evidence of adverse impacts and immediate action
should be taken to prevent debris reaching the marine environment,

Aware that a significant proportion of marine debris is the result of discharges of ship-generated
waste and cargo residues into the sea, abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear
(ALDFG), and that the protection of the marine environment can be enhanced significantly by
reducing these,

Recognizing that a range of international, regional and industry-based measures exist to
manage waste on board commercial marine vessels and prevent the disposal of garbage at
sea,

Further noting the adoption by the International Maritime Organization of amendments to
Annex V Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships of the International Convention for the
Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) which prohibits the discharge of all garbage from
ships into the sea from 1 January 2013, except in very limited circumstances,

Also recognizing that the International Maritime Organization is the authority regulating
shipping on the High Seas,

Conscious that a wide range of target audiences needs to be addressed through effective
public awareness and education campaigns in order to achieve the behavioural change
necessary for a significant reduction of marine debris,

           effects;
        g) population level effects on and welfare of migratory species as appropriate to
           national circumstances;

8. Encourages the Scientific Council, with support from the Secretariat, to promote the
   prioritization of research into the effects of microplastics on the species ingesting them,
   and support research on the significance of colour, shape or plastic type on the likelihood
   of causing harm;

9. Further encourages the Scientific Council to promote harmonization or standardization of
   protocols for the analysis of marine litter, including microplastics, in stranded organisms;

10. Requests the Secretariat, subject to availability of resources, to work with the United
    Nations Environment Programme Regional Seas Programme to support standardization
    and implementation of methods for studies monitoring impacts in order to produce
    comparable data across species and regions that will allow robust ranking of debris types
    for risk of harm across different species groups;

11. Requests that working groups established under the Scientific Council address the issue
    of marine debris where relevant, drawing on the work already undertaken by the
    Convention;

Commercial Marine Vessel Best Practice

    or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG), by following the strategies set out under the
    Food and Agriculture Organization’s Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries;

13. Further encourages Parties and invites other stakeholders to work towards achieving Goal
    B of the Global Framework for Prevention and Management of Marine Debris, agreed as
    part of the Honolulu Strategy: “Reduced amount and impact of sea-based sources of
    marine debris, including solid waste; lost cargo; abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded
    fishing gear (ALDFG); and abandoned vessels, introduced into the sea”;

14. Invites Parties to MARPOL Annex V to review and improve, if required, provisions
    regarding applicability to fishing vessels and deliberate abandonment of fish aggregating
    devices (FADs) and other types of fishing gear that contain plastics;

    and facilitating coordination to enable best practice measures to be implemented;

18. Welcomes activities of MEAs and fora related to marine issues to agree waste prevention
    measures on vessels and implement relevant ISO standards; such activities might or
    should include: shipping operators, ports and other key industries involved with the
    international transport of goods driving environmental demands, such as by adopting fee
    systems in ports that incentivize waste delivery through supporting the improvement of port
    waste reception facilities in general, requiring fishing equipment to be subject to mandatory
    deposit-and-refund schemes under extended producer responsibility, adopting, waste
    prevention measures on vessels and implementing relevant ISO standards;

          flakes and powders) to the marine environment;

20. Encourages Parties to establish public awareness campaigns in order to assist in
    preventing waste from reaching the marine environment and set up management initiatives
    for the removal of debris, including public beach and underwater clean-ups, such as ‘fishing
    for litter’ or ‘dive against debris’ schemes;

21. Strongly encourages Parties to note the examples of successful campaigns provided in
    UNEP/CMS/ScC18/10.4.3 when considering campaigns to address the most pressing
    needs in their area of jurisdiction, and to support or develop national or regional initiatives
    that respond to these needs;

22. Recommends that Parties planning to implement regulatory measures or economic
    instruments in order to reduce the amount of waste entering the environment to accompany
    these with behavioural change campaigns aiding their introduction by communicating the
    rationale for introducing the measure, and therefore increasing the likelihood of support;

23. Encourages Parties and the Secretariat to cooperate with organizations currently
    campaigning on marine debris, and seek to engage organizations dealing with migratory
    species to promote campaigns and raise awareness of marine debris amongst their
    members;

28. Requests Parties to cooperate regionally and globally on clean-up actions of hotspots of
    marine debris, with particular attention given to areas where migratory species are at higher
    risk, and to follow best available techniques and responsible environmental practices for
    the removal and sound disposal of debris;

29. Urges Parties to develop and implement their own national plans of action which should
    address the negative impacts of marine debris in waters within their jurisdiction, including
    the establishment of domestic programmes for the management of marine debris, including
    in relation to lost, abandoned, and otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) and the
    problems of ‘ghost fishing’ that arise from these;

30. Encourages Parties and organizations to build capacity in and support the efforts of Parties
    with limited resources in the development and implementation of their national plans of
    action for marine debris;
