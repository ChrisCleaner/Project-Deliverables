2020;
       3.       Also notes the importance of the active involvement of biosafety experts, including those

measurable to facilitate the review of progress in the implementation of the Protocol;
        7.      Further decides to expand the mandate and scope of the Liaison Group on Capacity-
Building for Biosafety, as outlined in the annex, include specific expertise on practical experience in
