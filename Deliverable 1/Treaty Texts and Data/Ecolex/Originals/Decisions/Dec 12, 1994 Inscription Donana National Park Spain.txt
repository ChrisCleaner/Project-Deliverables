Donana   National Park    \n  685  \n  Spain    \n  N(ii) (iii)   (iv)  \n The Committee inscribed this site as an exceptional example of a large Mediterranean wetland with diverse habitats such as marshes, forests, pristine beaches, dunes and lagoons, which supports high faunal diversity, particularly large numbers of migratory birds of the palearctic region. \n The Committee complemented the Spanish authorities on measures taken to improve protection of the site during the past two years and their efforts to maintain the integrity of the site. The Committee, however, alerted the Spanish authorities to continuing threats to the integrity of the site arising from hydrological projects and encouraged them in their on-going efforts to restore disturbed parts of the Park. The Committee requested that the Spanish authorities submit a report on the site, particularly highlighting the results of the project to regulate water supply by 1998. \n &nbsp;
