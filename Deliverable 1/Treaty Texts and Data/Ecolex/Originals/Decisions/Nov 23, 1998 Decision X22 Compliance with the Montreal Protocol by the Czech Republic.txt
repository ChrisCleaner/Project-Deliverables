The  Tenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. X/22:      To note that the Czech Republic ratified the London and Copenhagen Amendments on 18 December 1996. The country is classified as a non-Article 5 Party under the Protocol. For 1996, the Czech Republic reported positive consumption of 49.6 ODP tonnes of Annex A, Group I, substances that are partially accounted for under the essential-use exemption by the Parties for laboratory and analytical applications. However, the Czech Republic claims the remainder of the 1996 CFC consumption was for essential uses for metered-dose inhalers. But, as the Czech Republic imported ozone-depleting substances in 1996 without obtaining an essential-use authorization from the Parties to the Protocol, the Czech Republic was in state of technical non-compliance with its control obligations under Articles 2A through 2E of the Montreal Protocol for 1996. The Czech Republic reported to the Implementation Committee that it has the utmost interest in reliably meeting its obligations under the Montreal Protocol;   To take note of the Czech Republic\xe2\x80\x99s status regarding obligations under Articles 2A through 2E of the Montreal Protocol for 1996 and ask the Implementation Committee to continue to review annually the Czech Republic\xe2\x80\x99s status.
