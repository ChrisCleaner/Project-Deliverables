VII.16   Whale sanctuary of El Viscaino (Mexico)  \n The Committee recalled that the Bureau at its last session took note of the report on the site, presented by the IUCN Representative, indicating that the Mitsubishi Corporation in partnership with the Mexican Government, has a project to convert a part of the lagoon into salt ponds for industrial salt production. A one-mile long pier is proposed, which could disturb the grey whales within the lagoon. The Committee noted that no response has yet been received to a letter written to the authorities indicating the concerns raised at the nineteenth session of the Bureau. The Delegate of Mexico took the floor and informed the Committee that the project is still under study. \n &nbsp;
