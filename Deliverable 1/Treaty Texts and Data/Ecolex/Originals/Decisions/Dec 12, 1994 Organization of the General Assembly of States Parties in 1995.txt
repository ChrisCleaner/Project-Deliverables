XVI.1  The Committee took note of document WHC-94/CONF&shy;003/14 which reported on the deliberations of the eighteenth session of the Bureau with regard to a proposal for the modification of paragraphs 8 and 12 of Rule 13 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly. \n  XVI.2  The Delegations of Italy and France presented the following proposal for an amendment to the Rules of Procedure: \n  "The proposal of the Bureau to simplify the procedures of the election of the Committee is certainly to be supported. However, we believe that a shift from the absolute majority to a simple majority after only two ballots may be an obstacle to the aim of obtaining the necessary consensus.  \n  Therefore, it is proposed to shift to the simple majority after four ballots and that the proposed amendments to the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly (Arts. 13.8, 13.9 and 13.10) be modified in this way."  \n This proposed amendment was endorsed by the Committee. \n  XVI.3  It was noted from the Chair that the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly could be changed only by the General Assembly itself. Therefore the Committee\'s proposal would be presented to the General Assembly for its consideration. \n &nbsp;
