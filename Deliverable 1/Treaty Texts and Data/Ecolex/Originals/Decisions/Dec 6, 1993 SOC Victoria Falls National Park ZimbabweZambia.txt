Victoria Falls   National Park   (Zimbabwe/Zambia)  \n IUCN reported about the proposed construction of a dam (Batoka Gorge Hydro Power Scheme), which would not affect the Falls but would have a serious impact on the lower gorges, changing the character of the site from a turbulent river to a hydroelectric reservoir. The Committee was informed about an environmental impact assessment to which the IUCN Office in Harare was contributing technical assistance. The Committee requested the Centre to invite the authorities of both Zimbabwe and Zambia to activate the joint Victoria Falls World Heritage Management Committee in order to promote a coordinated approach to manage this transfrontier site. The Committee also asked to be kept informed of the possible dam project. \n &nbsp;
