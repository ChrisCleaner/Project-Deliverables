linkages,\n\nFurther recalling the Luanda Commitment (2010) on the implementation of the Libreville Declaration on Health and Environment in Africa, in which ministers of health and the environment identified chemicals management as one of the top continental health and environment priorities to be addressed to accelerate the implementation of the Libreville Declaration,\n\nBearing in mind the Call for Action on E-waste in Africa, which sets out a list of priority actions to support the development of a regional approach for transboundary movements and Environmental Sound Management  of

dramatic cases of dumping of hazardous waste in Africa, such as in Koko, Nigeria and in Abidjan, Ivory Coast and many other cases,\n\nDetermined to resolve current health and environmental challenges through the effective implementation of both the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management and the chemicals-related international conventions, which requires that the policies of the
