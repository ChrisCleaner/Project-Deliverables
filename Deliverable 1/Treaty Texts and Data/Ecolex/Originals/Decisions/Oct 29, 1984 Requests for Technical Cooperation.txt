34. The Committee  noted  that the total of the sums requested for technical cooperation greatly exceeded the allocation of $200,000 which the Committee had approved for technical cooperation in 1985. \n The Committee  decided , therefore, that for this year technical cooperation projects should not exceed $20,000 each, and that no individual decisions would be taken on these requests before their further study and evaluation. \n The Committee  asked  the Secretariat  to further consult  with the countries concerned and with ICOMOS and IUCN as appropriate  and to submit  these requests directly to the Chairman of the Committee who, in accordance with paragraph 71 of the Operational Guidelines, had the authority to approve technical cooperation requests up to an amount of $20,000. The Secretariat would then report on the Chairman\'s decisions at the ninth session of the Bureau in 1985. \n &nbsp;
