At the time of inscription the site was not defined by mapped boundaries. In response to increasing threats through tourism, development etc., English Heritage together with the authorities and landowners devised a management plan for the site. \n The Representative of ICOMOS underlined the exemplary nature of the management plan which ensures cooperation between all partners, a strategy for tourism management and provides a clear definition of the boundaries of the site. An extensive buffer zone has been identified along Hadrian\'s Wall and its associated sites. The plan further foresees the establishment of a database and periodic monitoring. &nbsp;  \n The Bureau commended the authorities of the United Kingdom for the preparation of the management plan for Hadrian\'s Wall and for the clear delimitation of the site.
