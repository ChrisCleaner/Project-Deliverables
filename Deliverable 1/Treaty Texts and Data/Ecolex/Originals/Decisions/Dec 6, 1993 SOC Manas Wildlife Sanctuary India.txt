Manas Wildlife Sanctuary (India)  \n The Committee recalled that the site was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger at its sixteenth session in 1992 due to threats caused by the encroachment of the Bodo tribe. No response had been received from the Government of India to several letters transmitting the Committee\'s previous requests for information since 1990. The Director of the World Heritage Centre informed the Committee furthermore that a mission to India was undertaken by a staff member of the Centre to contact the authorities directly. The Committee had an extensive discussion on the action to be taken, including the possibility of delisting the site. Several delegates voiced their concerns about the failure of the Government of India to respond to the Committee\'s request. However, the present situation makes a site mission impossible. The Committee agreed to take further steps: (i) to request the Director&shy;-General of UNESCO to express, by letter to the Prime Minister of India, the Committee\'s concern; and ii) that other diplomatic channels be used to transmit the Committee\'s concerns about the continuing threats to Park values by the invasion of the Bodo tribe, as well as subsequent encroachments and poaching activities. \n &nbsp;
