It is desirable to carry out initial preparatory work to establish that a property has the potential to justify Outstanding Universal Value, including integrity or authenticity, before the development of a full nomination dossier which could be expensive and time-consuming.\xc2\xa0 Such preparatory work might include collection of available information on the property, thematic studies, scoping studies of the potential for demonstrating Outstanding Universal Value, including integrity or authenticity, or an initial comparative study of the property in its wider global or regional context, including an analysis in the context of the Gap Studies produced by the Advisory Bodies.\xc2\xa0 Such work will help to establish the feasibility of a possible nomination at an early stage and avoid use of resources on nominations that may be unlikely to succeed. States Parties are invited to contact the Advisory Bodies and the World Heritage Centre at the earliest opportunity in considering nominations to seek information and guidance.  \n  Annex 2  \n  New Paragraph 210  \n The Committee requested the Secretariat with the Advisory Bodies, in consultation with the relevant States Parties, to develop long-term follow-up Regional Programmes structured according to its Strategic Objectives and to submit them  for its examination.

These  They should accurately reflect the needs of World Heritage in the Region and facilitate the granting of International Assistance. The Committee also expressed its support to ensure direct links between the Strategic Objectives and the International Assistance. \n  New Paragraph 235  \n The World Heritage Committee co-ordinates and allocates types of International Assistance in response to State Party requests. These types of International Assistance, described in the summary table set out below, in order of priority are: \n a) Emergency assistance \n b) Conservation and Management assistance (incorporating assistance for training and research, technical co-operation and promotion and education) \n c) \xc2\xa0Preparatory assistance. \n \xc2\xa0 New Paragraph 238  \n To support its Strategic Objectives, the Committee also allocates International Assistance in conformity with the priorities set out  by   in its decisions and in the  Regional Programmes  it adopts  as a follow up to Periodic Reports (see  para. 210).   These Programmes are adopted as a follow up to Periodic Reports  and regularly reviewed by the Committee based on the needs of States Parties identified in Periodic Reports (see chapter\xc2\xa0V).  \n  \xc2\xa0  New Paragraph 240  \n A balance will be maintained in the allocation of resources  for  between cultural and natural heritage  and between Conservation &amp; Management and Preparatory Assistance . This balance is reviewed and decided upon on a regular basis by the Committee and during the last 3 months of each biennium by the Chairperson of the World Heritage Committee. \n  New Paragraph 241  \n [ Preparatory ] assistance may be requested to  (in order of priority):  \n (i) prepare or update national Tentative Lists of properties suitable for inscription on the World Heritage List;  a   commitment will be required from the State Party to nominate in priority on these lists sites recognized in approved thematic advice, such as the thematic studies prepared by the Advisory Bodies, as corresponding to gaps on the List;  \n (ii) organize meetings for the harmonization of national Tentative Lists within the same geo-cultural area; \n (iii) prepare nominations of properties for inscription on the World Heritage List  (  this may include,   including preparatory work such as collection of basic information, scoping studies of the potential for demonstration of Outstanding Universal Value, including integrity or authenticity,  comparative  studies  of the property in relation to other similar properties (see 3. c  2  of Annex 5),  including analysis in the context of the Gap Studies produced by the Advisory Bodies . Priority will be given  to requests for   sites recognized in approved thematic advice as corresponding to gaps on the List and/or for sites where   preliminary investigations have shown that further inquiries would be justified  , especially in the case of  States Parties whose heritage is un-represented or under-represented on the World Heritage List. \n (iv) \xc2\xa0prepare requests for  Conservation &amp; Management assistance for consideration by the World Heritage Committee   for training and research assistance and for technical co-operation for World Heritage properties . \n  \xc2\xa0  New Paragraph 252  \n All requests for International Assistance of more than US$ 5,000, except those of Emergency Assistance  up to and including US$ 75,000 , are evaluated by a panel composed of representatives of the World Heritage Centre Regional Desks and the Advisory Bodies, and if possible the Chairperson of the World Heritage Committee or one vice-chairperson, meeting  at least   once or  twice a year before action by the Chairperson and/or Committee.  Requests for the approval of the Chairperson can be submitted at anytime to the Secretariat and approved by the Chairperson after appropriate evaluation.  Requests for Emergency Assistance  of up to and including US$ 75,000   can be submitted at anytime to the Secretariat   and  will be submitted  for approval   by  to the Chairperson  of the World Heritage Committee   or to the Committee at its next session for decision  after comments by the Advisory Bodies and without examination by the panel.

Requests for which the panel issues a positive or a negative recommendation will be submitted to the Chairperson/Committee for decision. A second panel may be held at least eight weeks before the Committee session for requests which were revised since the first panel. Requests sent back for a substantial revision will be examined by the panel depending on their date of receipt. Requests requiring only minor revision and no further examination by the panel must come back within the year when they were examined first; otherwise they will be sent again to a next panel. The chart detailing the submission process is attached in Annex 8.
