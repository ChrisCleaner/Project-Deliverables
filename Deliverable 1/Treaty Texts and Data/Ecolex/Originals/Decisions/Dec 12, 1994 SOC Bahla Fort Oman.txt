Bahla Fort (Oman)  \n The Committee recalled that it was informed during its seventeenth session, that intensive restoration works were being undertaken at this site and that it appeared probable that the nature of the material used for the restoration work, the rapidity with which the work was being carried out and the methods used could raise a certain number of questions with regard to conserving the authenticity of the monument. The Committee was informed that the Director of the World Heritage Centre, at the invitation of the Government of Oman, undertook a mission to Oman in March 1994 during which he was able to examine the progress of restoration work underway. Following this mission it was agreed with the national authorities that an expert mission would take place from 10 to 19 December 1994. \n The Committee decided to retain this site on the List of World Heritage in Danger and requested that the results of this mission be presented to the nineteenth session of the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee in 1995. \n &nbsp;
