VII.62 Aksum (Ethiopia)  \n The Bureau at its twentieth extraordinary session took note of the report provided by the Secretariat that the site management should be strengthened by providing and collecting scientific documentation at the site level as the basis for management and conservation planning, particularly in view of the master plan that is being prepared. \n The Bureau warmly thanked the Ethiopian authorities for all their efforts and the measures already taken to ensure the preservation and enhancement of this site. It asked the Centre for Research and Conservation of the Cultural Heritage (CRCCH) to continue its efforts and to ensure that the scientific documentation at the site be made available to the site manager. It reiterated that the compilation of this documentation is a prerequisite for the preparation of the management and conservation plans, and that UNESCO is always ready to provide, where necessary, assistance in obtaining documents that are not available in Ethiopia. \n &nbsp;
