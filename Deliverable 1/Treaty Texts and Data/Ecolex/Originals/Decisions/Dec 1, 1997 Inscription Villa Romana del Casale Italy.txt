Villa Romana del Casale  \n  832   \n  Italy     \n  C(i)(ii)(iii)   \n The Committee decided to inscribe this property on the basis of criteria (i), (ii) and (iii), considering that the Villa del Casale at Piazza Armerina is the supreme example of a luxury Roman villa, which graphically illustrates the predominant social and economic structure of its age. The mosaics that decorate it are exceptional for their artistic quality and invention as well as their extent. \n The Committee asked the State Party to provide a report on the conservation and management of the site and in particular on the monitoring of the climatic conditions within the protective structures and their impact on the archaeological remains. \n &nbsp;
