The  Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVII/20:      To note with appreciation that 185 Parties out of the 188 that should have reported data for 2004 have done so, and that 114 of those Parties reported their data by 30 June 2005 in conformance with decision XV/15;   To note, however, that the following Parties have still not reported 2004 data: Cook Islands, Mozambique, Nauru;   To note that this places the Parties listed in paragraph 2 in non-compliance with their data-reporting obligations under the Montreal Protocol until such time as the Secretariat receives their outstanding data;   To urge the Parties listed in paragraph 2, where appropriate, to work closely with the implementing agencies to report the required data to the Secretariat as a matter of urgency, and to request the Implementation Committee to review the situation of those Parties at its next meeting;   To note also that lack of timely data reporting by Parties impedes effective monitoring and assessment of Parties\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with their obligations under the Montreal Protocol;   To note further that reporting by 30 June each year greatly facilitates the work of the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol in assisting Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol to comply with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s control measures;   To encourage Parties to continue to report consumption and production data as soon as figures are available, and preferably by 30 June each year, as agreed in decision XV/15.
