The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/11:     Bearing  in mind that, under standard 15 of the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures, of March 2002, of the International Plant Protection Convention of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, guidelines were issued regulating wood packaging materials in international trade, which approved heat treatments and fumigation by methyl bromide for wood packaging to reduce the risk of the introduction and/or spread of quarantine pest associated with wood packaging used in trade,    Understanding  that these guidelines are intended to address quarantine and pre-shipment applications,    Considering  that coordination among United Nations bodies is essential for the attainment of their common goals,    Taking into account  that the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel is conducting assessments on methyl bromide alternatives on quarantine and pre-shipment uses,     To request the Ozone Secretariat to make contact with the Secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, stressing the commitment by Parties to the Montreal Protocol to the reduction of methyl bromide with specific reference to standard 15 of the International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures, and to exchange information with a view to encouraging alternatives to methyl bromide treatment of wood packaging material stipulated by that organization as a phytosanitary measure;   To request the Ozone Secretariat to report thereon to the Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties;   To urge the Parties to consider, in the context of standard 15 of the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures, the use, as a priority and to the greatest possible extent, when economically feasible and when the country concerned has the required facilities of alternatives such as heat treatment or alternative packaging materials, instead of methyl bromide fumigation;   To encourage the importing Parties to consider accepting wood packaging treated with alternative methods to methyl bromide, in accordance with standard 15.
