The Mali authorities have committed themselves to the launching of a pilot project to which the management committees and the masons responsible for the three mosques of Djingareiber, Sankor&eacute; and Sidi Yahia which are inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger, will be associated. Last June the authorities signed a contract with the World Heritage Centre for the first phase of the project, that is the gathering of information and preparations for the pilot work to be undertaken in 1996. \n During the implementation of the second phase of the project, the Mali authorities will require assitance in the form of international expertise. To this end, a technical cooperation request will be submitted to the Committee. \n The Bureau congratulated the Mali authorities on the rate of implementation of the project which was endorsed by the Committee at its eighteenth session at Phuket, and encouraged them to pursue their efforts for the preservation of this heritage.
