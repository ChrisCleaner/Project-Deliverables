This site, which was inscribed in 1992, is threatened by the expansion of activities linked with tourism. The avenues and surrounding area of the archaeological site are threatened by urbanism and the construction of hotel complexes. Moreover, the archaeological site is subject to vibrations from the nearby airport which now accommodates large carriers, and for which an extension is planned. \n The Bureau requested the World Heritage Centre to request the Greek authorities to ensure that the Antiquities Law is strictly observed, so as to limit threats weighing on the site due to tourist development activities and notably the construction of hotels in the zone of Pythagoreion. In view of the danger caused by increased air traffic, the authorities should be requested to halt possible plans to extend the airport and preferably to identify a more appropriate site.
