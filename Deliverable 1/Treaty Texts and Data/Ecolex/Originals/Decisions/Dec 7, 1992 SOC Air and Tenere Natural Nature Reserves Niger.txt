Air and Tenere Nature Reserve (Niger)  \n The Committee expressed concern that the region in which this site is situated has recently been affected by civil disturbance. The Committee was informed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of Niger had requested the Director-General of UNESCO to launch an appeal for the protection of this site. The competent authorities in Niger, in accordance with the recommendation of the Bureau made at its last session in Paris in July 1992, have requested the Committee to include this site in the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Niger authorities have also requested financial assistance for the organization of a mission in order to assess the state of conservation of this site. \n  The Committee decided to include this site in the List of World Heritage in Danger.  Noting with regret that six members of the Reserve staff are being held hostage since February 1992, the Committee decided not to support any mission to the site until such time as security conditions in the region have returned to normal. The Committee instructed the Centre to contact the relevant authorities in Niger and request them to take all measures possible in order to secure the safe release of the Reserve staff. \n &nbsp;
