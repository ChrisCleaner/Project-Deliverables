Ngorongoro Conservation Area (Tanzania)  \n The Committee recalled that the site was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990 and noted the recommendations and discussion of the seventeenth session of the Bureau concerning uncontrolled cultivation in the conservation area. Technically, this cultivation is not permissible under the legislation for the area and much damage to natural values had been caused. \n The Director of the World Heritage Centre and the Director of the UNESCO Division of Physical Heritage provided information regarding the situation of the site\'s cultural heritage (Olduvai Gorge), and particularly regarding the serious threats to the footprints of early man. The Committee was informed that a project by the Getty Conservation Institute was underway to protect this priceless cultural heritage. \n The Committee discussed the possibility of including the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger. It was noted that the Government of Germany provided US$ 275,000 for the preparation of a new Management Plan for the site. \n Finally, the Committee requested the Centre to report back at the next session of its Bureau in 1994 regarding the protection of the cultural values of the site. The Centre should also transmit to the Government of Tanzania the Committee\'s serious concerns regarding the  ongoing  cultivation which threatens the natural values of this property. \n &nbsp;
