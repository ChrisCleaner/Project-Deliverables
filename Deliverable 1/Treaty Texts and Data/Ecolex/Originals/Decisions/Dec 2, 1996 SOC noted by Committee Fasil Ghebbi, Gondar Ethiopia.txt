VII.65 Fasil Ghebbi (Gondar, Ethiopia)  \n Gondar was the political capital of Christian Ethiopia from 1632 to the middle of the 19th century. The Secretariat reported that an extensive and high quality three-year restoration programme is being undertaken to transform the main palace into a museum of Gondarian Civilization. \n The Committee warmly thanked the Directorate of the Centre for Research and Conservation of the Ethiopian Cultural Heritage (CRCCH) for the financial and human efforts made towards the preservation of this World Heritage site, as well as the si te manager for his commitment and the quality of his work. It considered the conservation project underway to be highly satisfactory and exemplary, and hoped that other World Heritage sites will benefit from the competence and expertise of the team in charge of the work. It would also be advisable that the documentation concerning the history of the site and its restoration be collected and deposited at Gondar and thus made easily accessible to those working at the site. \n &nbsp;
