VIII.25 Los Katios National Park (Colombia)  \n The Delegate of Colombia informed the Bureau that the field visit foreseen from 10-12 November 2000 had not taken place and looked forward to a visit in 2001. Such a field visit would not only review the state of conservation of the site, but moreover review co-operation possibilities for a World Heritage nomination of the meso-american biological corridor project and transboundary collaboration with the adjacent Darien National Park (Panama). \n &nbsp;
