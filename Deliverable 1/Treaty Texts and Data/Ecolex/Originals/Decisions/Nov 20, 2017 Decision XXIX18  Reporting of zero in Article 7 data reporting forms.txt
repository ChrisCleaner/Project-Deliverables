Recalling  decision XXIV/14, in which the Twenty-Fourth Meeting of the Parties recalled the need for consistent reporting of production, imports, exports and destruction of ozone-depleting substances in accordance with Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and noted that the forms for reporting in accordance with Article 7 submitted by parties sometimes contained blank cells, in which no numbers indicating quantities of ozone-depleting substances were entered, and that such blank cells could be intended by a party in a given case to indicate zero controlled substances or, alternatively, could represent non-reporting by that party in respect of those substances,    Recalling also  that, by decision XXIV/14, the Twenty-Fourth Meeting of the Parties requested the parties, when reporting production, imports, exports or destruction, to enter a number, including zero, where appropriate, in each cell in the data reporting forms that they submitted, rather than leaving the cell blank, and asked the Secretariat to request clarification from any party that submitted a form containing a blank cell,   1. To note with appreciation that the majority of parties are complying with the request made in decision XXIV/14 to enter a number, including zero, where appropriate, in each cell in the data reporting forms that they submit, rather than leaving the cell blank;   2. To note, however, that some parties are continuing to submit forms containing blank cells, which requires additional work by the Secretariat to request clarification from the parties and results in delays in compiling information and assessing parties\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with the control measures under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer;   3. To urge the parties, when submitting forms for reporting data in accordance with Article 7, to ensure that all cells in the forms are completed with a number, including zero, where appropriate, rather than leaving the cell blank;   4. To request the Implementation Committee under the Non\xe2\x80\x91Compliance Procedure for the Montreal Protocol to review the status of compliance by the parties with paragraph 3 of the present decision at its sixty-first meeting.
