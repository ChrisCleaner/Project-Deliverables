The Bureau took note of the report presented by ICOMOS and commended the State Party on the importance it has attached to restoration and rehabilitation projects at these two sites. The Bureau, however, expressed concern over the development projects within the two sites, and urged the State Party to give special attention to the upgrading of street surfacing and furniture in the vicinity of the major monuments, to the control over non-listed buildings in the historic centres, and in the case of Bukhara, to the clearance of blocked cisterns and channels so as to lower the water table.
