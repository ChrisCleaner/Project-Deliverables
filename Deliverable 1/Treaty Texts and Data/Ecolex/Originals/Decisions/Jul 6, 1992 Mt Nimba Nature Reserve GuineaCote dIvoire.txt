The Bureau recalled that the Committee at its last session concluded that the reduction in the size of this site proposed by the Government of Guinea in order to exclude areas that would be impacted by a proposed iron-ore mining project, posed a major threat to its integrity. Taking into account that the site also faced several other threats, the Committee, at its last session recommended that the Governments of C6te d\'Ivoire and Guinea nominate this site for inscription on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n The Bureau noted with satisfaction that experts of Cote d\'Ivoire and Guinea, together with representatives of UNDP and UNESCO had met, from 29 June to 3 July 1992, at Mt Nimba and, on the basis of field visits and consultations, have endorsed the conclusions of the Committee and requested the Governments of C6te d\'Ivoire and Guinea to urgently nominate this site for inclusion on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Bureau noted with concern that the site continues to be under pressure from interest groups which are eager to take advantage of the economic benefits of exploiting the iron-ore deposits in this site. The Bureau, however, noted that so far no iron-ore mining activities have been undertaken and that bi-and multilateral donors have refrained from financing such a project. \n The Bureau requested the World Heritage Centre to contact the authorities of Cote d\'Ivoire and Guinea and, once again, urge them to nominate this site to the List of World Heritage in Danger. Furthermore, the Bureau recommended that the World Heritage Centre co-operate with the two States Parties concerned and donor agencies such as the World Bank and UNDP to develop a integrated rural development project to bring socio-economic benefits to people living in the immediate vicinity of this World Heritage site.
