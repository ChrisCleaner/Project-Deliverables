The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-10/34.COM/7A.Add, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  33 COM 7A.11 , adopted at its 33rd session (Seville, 2009), \n 3.  Takes note  of the efforts undertaken by the State Party to satisfy the requirements of the corrective measures for removal of the property from the List of World Heritage in Danger; \n 4.  Notes with concern  the findings of the joint World Heritage Centre /IUCN reactive monitoring mission of May 2010 indicating that the problems of biodiversity loss, the drying up of the ponds and the spread of invasive species continue to threaten the Outstanding Universal Value of the property despite efforts by the State Party to improve the allocation of financial and human resources to the Niokolo-Koba National Park (NKNP); \n 5.  Notes with satisfaction  the level of protection enjoyed by the giant eland at national level, which satisfies de facto the corrective measure requesting the establishment of a moratorium, as well as an increase in the national budget and the deployment of a mobile surveillance brigade for the protection of the property; \n 6.  Urges  the State Party to continue the implementation of immediate corrective measures as revised during the May 2010 mission, and the recommendations made by the mission: \n - Corrective measures to be implemented by July 2011: \n a) Strengthen and establish the anti-poaching mechanism, \n b) Increase the staff of the property and provide, as soon as possible, training for them focusing on the protection of the proterty, its integrated management, security regulations, and provide them with equipment essential to their mission, \n c) Propose and implement real alternatives to the drilling of boreholes outside the park in order to reduce the straying of cattle in the overall context of seasonal migration in Senegal (for example, sub-regional workshop), \n - Corrective measures to be implemented by July 2012: \n d) Update the park\'s ecological monitoring program based on indicators that are simple, reliable and inexpensive to measure, and on statistics from reliable censuses of populations of threatened species (lions, giant eland, elephants, chimpanzees, wild dogs,...) and key species, and integrate it into the property Management Plan, \n e) Improve boundary marking of the property and ensure better communication on this subject through signage adapted to the specificities of each communinity in the vicinity of the property, \n - Corrective measures to be implemented by July 2013: \n f) Set up an emergency programme to restore the ponds in the property and its periphery and make concrete proposals for alternatives to ponds as watering points in the property, \n g) Rehabilitate unusable tracks in the property, concentrating on the southern half of the park; \n 7.  Requests  the State Party to undertake as soon as possible a survey of key wildlife species of the property with the technical support of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, which will serve as a basis for monitoring the recovery of species and the ecological monitoring, and  invites  the State Party to submit an International Assistance Request to help finance the survey it; \n 8.  Appeals  to the international community to provide support for the urgent implementation of the revised corrective measures; \n 9.  Remains very concerned  by the proposed Sambangalou dam and  urges  the State Party to submit a specific study of the impacts of the dam on the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, including the possible reduction of areas of forest-galleries and Ronier Palm stands within the property, on the fording of the river by large animals and on the alimentation of water to the flood basins and ponds in the property, before making a decision on its construction, in accordance with Paragraph 172 of the  Operational Guidelines ; \n 10.  Also requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2011 , a report on the state of conservation and progress in the implementation of the revised corrective measures, for consideration by the World Heritage Committee at its 35 session in 2011; \n 11.  Further requests  the State Party to invite, as soon as the identification of key species of wildlife on the property will be available, a reactive monitoring mission to take stock of the overall conservation status of the property and progress in the implementation of the revised corrective measures; \n  12.  Decides  to maintain the Niokolo-Koba National Park (Senegal) on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
