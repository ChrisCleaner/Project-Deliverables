Noting with appreciation  the 2009 and 2010 progress reports of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel on process agents,    Noting  that table A in decision X/14 on process-agent uses has been updated by decisions\xc2\xa0XV/6, XVII/7 and XIX/15,    Noting also  that the Panel\'s 2010 progress report indicates that several parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol included in table B of decision X/14 have reported that they no longer use any controlled substances as process agents, and that three process-agent uses have been discontinued in the European Union,    Recalling  that the Panel\'s 2009 progress report on process agents indicated that Israel had reported the use of controlled substances for a process-agent application included in table A of decision X/14,    Recalling also  that, according to decision X/14, quantities of controlled substances produced or imported by parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 for use as process agents in plants and installations in operation before 1 January 1999 should not be taken into account in the calculation of production and consumption from 1 January 2002 onwards, provided that emissions of those substances have been reduced to levels agreed by the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol to be reasonably achievable in a cost-effective manner without undue abandonment of infrastructure,    Recognizing  that, in the light of the phase-out dates of 1 January 2010 applicable to chlorofluorocarbons and carbon tetrachloride under the Montreal Protocol, the Executive Committee is unlikely to agree on any further emission levels for the use of such substances as process agents in parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 beyond 2010,    Recognizing also  the substantial progress undertaken by parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 in reducing the use and emissions of controlled substances used as process agents,    Aware  that the use and emissions of controlled substances used as process agents will continue beyond 2010 in only two parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5,     Agreeing  that both parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and those not so operating that report process agent uses should now be listed in table B of decision X/14 and that those of the latter parties not using controlled substances as process agents should be removed from that table,    Noting  that the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund will provide a joint report to the Open-ended Working Group at its thirty-first meeting, in 2011, on further efforts to reduce uses of process agents,   1.\xc2\xa0That quantities of controlled substances produced or imported by parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 for use as process agents in plants and installations in operation before 1 January 1999 should not be taken into account in the calculation of production and consumption from 1 January 2011 onwards, provided that emissions of those substances are within the levels defined in the updated table B of decision X/14 included in the annex to the present decision;   2.\xc2\xa0To update tables A and B of decision X/14 as set out in the annex to the present decision;   3.\xc2\xa0To request each party to report to the Ozone Secretariat, by 15 March 2011, if possible, or 1 July 2011 at the latest, the specific applications for which it uses controlled substances as process agents and to continue to report such information in the context of the annual reports required by decision X/14;   4.\xc2\xa0To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to include, in its 2011 progress report, a table listing process agent uses by individual parties;   5.\xc2\xa0To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, beyond the reporting and assessment in respect of process agent uses requested for 2011, to review in 2013, and every second year thereafter, progress made in reducing process agent uses and to make any additional recommendations to parties on further actions to reduce uses and emissions of process agents;   6.\xc2\xa0That, once all process agent projects approved by the Executive Committee are completed, reporting by the Executive Committee to the parties as requested in decision XVII/6 will no longer be required;
