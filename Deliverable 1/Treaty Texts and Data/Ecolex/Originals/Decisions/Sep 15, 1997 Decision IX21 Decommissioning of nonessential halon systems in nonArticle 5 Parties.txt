The  Ninth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. IX/21:     Noting  that in its 1994 report, the Scientific Assessment Panel identified decommissioning and destruction of halon as the second most environmentally beneficial potential approach to further lowering stratospheric chlorine and bromine abundances but that the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel concluded that such an approach, while technically feasible, was not appropriate at that time,    Noting  that the Seventh Meeting of the Parties took action in relation to methyl bromide controls, which was the approach identified by the Scientific Assessment Panel as the most environmentally beneficial approach at that time,    Noting  also that Parties are considering further controls on methyl bromide,    Recognizing  that, since 1994, some Parties have taken action to decommission and commence destruction of non-essential halon,    Recognizing  that depletion of the ozone layer continues to be a significant environmental concern and that atmospheric concentrations of halons continue to increase,    Recognizing  that the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel is currently conducting an assessment of the availability of halons for critical uses under the terms of decision VIII/17,     To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to examine the feasibility of early decommissioning in non-Article 5 Parties of all non-essential halon systems, and the subsequent destruction or redeployment of halon stocks not required for those critical uses that have no identified substitutes or alternatives, bearing in mind the need of Article 5 Parties for halon. In undertaking such an examination, TEAP should also examine the efficacy of halon alternatives, experience with potential measures to ensure safety and to minimize any emissions of halons during decommissioning, and experience with the cost and efficiency of storage prior to destruction and with halon destruction activities undertaken to date;   To request TEAP to report on this matter to the Tenth Meeting of the Parties.
