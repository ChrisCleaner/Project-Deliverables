The Bureau recalled that the Committee at its last session had been concerned about the unplanned and uncontrolled expansion of the village of Zabljak and its environs and requested clarification regarding the boundary adjustments under consideration. Furthermore the Committee had considered an engineering evaluation of the earthen containment structures built within the earthquake prone flood plains of the Tara River. \n The Bureau was informed that the Management of the Durmitor National Park have informed the Centre that their proposal to excise the 40 ha area around the village of Zabljak from the Park area had been approved by the Government of the Republic of Montenegro and that the Management wished to know whether the World Heritage Committee would agree with the proposed modification of the Park boundary. The Park Management, while ensuring high protection of the Tara River Canyon, and supporting spelaeological, hydrological, biological and archeological studies there, had not reacted to the Committee\'s suggestion for an engineering evaluation of the earthen containment structures built in the earthquake prone flood plains of the River. Finally the Management has brought to the attention of the Centre its concerns regarding the revival of plans for exploiting the hydropower potential of the River to resolve the problem of the negative balance of power faced by the Republic of Montenegro. \n The Bureau requested the Park Management to submit to the Centre, before 15 September 1997, a map showing the proposed modification of the Park\'s boundaries to excise the 40 ha area around the village of Zabljak and recommended that the Committee at its next session in December 1997 decide whether or not the proposed boundary modification is acceptable. Furthermore, the Bureau requested the Centre to request clarification from the Durmitor authorities whether they feel that an engineering evaluation of the earthen containment structures in the flood plains of the River is necessary. Finally, the Bureau requested the Centre to transmit its concerns to the relevant authorities regarding their plans for tapping the hydropower potential of the Tara River and obtain more information on this subject for submission to the Committee session in December 1997.
