All Parties should: a) immediately bring every seizure of illegal Encephalartos species specimens made within their territories to the attention of authorities in range States, countries of origin, transit and destination, as applicable, and to the attention of the Secretariat. Information on the seizure should be accompanied by available associated information to enable follow-up investigations to take place; b) notify the CITES Secretariat of seizures of specimens of Encephalartos species specimens for which the origin cannot be determined. Such a notification should include information describing the circumstances of the seizure; c) submit samples from specimens of Encephalartos species specimens confiscated and/or subject to criminal investigation, to designated forensic laboratories for DNA analysis on the basis of a standard protocol provided by South Africa; d) prior to issuing permits or certificates, including pre-Convention certificates, authorizing the import or re-export of specimens of Encephalartos species, consult with the country of origin, so that the true nature of the trade and source of specimens may be confirmed and monitored.
