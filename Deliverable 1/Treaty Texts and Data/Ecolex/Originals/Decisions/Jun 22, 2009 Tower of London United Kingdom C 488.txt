The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-09/33.COM/7B, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  32 COM 7B.112 , adopted at its 32nd session (Quebec City, 2008), \n 3.  Notes  the information provided by the State Party, in particular that the work is progressing on a brief to define a local setting, for the final publication "Seeing the History in View: a method for Assessing Heritage Significance within Views" in 2009, and that considerations are underway on how a Dynamic Visual Impact Study fits within the planning system, and that a draft revised London Plan is to be published for public consultation in 2009; \n 4.  Regrets  that a buffer zone with protection has still not been put in place; \n 5.  Also regrets  that there is no overall study of the setting of the Tower yet in place that would allow a full impact assessment of proposed development; \n 6.  Requests  the State Party to ensure that: \n a) The original intentions of the suggested "Skyline Study" are incorporated in related work being progressed as part of the Dynamic Visual Impact Study and the London Views Management Framework, \n b) The new Mayor\'s review of the supplementary planning guidance, the London Views Management Framework, fully takes into account the relevant views of the November 2006 joint World Heritage Centre / ICOMOS mission, \n c) The sub-group of the Tower of London World  Heritage Site Consultative Committee, fully considers the need for protection of the immediate surrounding of the Tower of London through an adequate and commonly agreed buffer zone; \n 7.  Urges  the State Party to progress towards a buffer zone as soon as possible and bringing together guidance on visual impact in order to put in place a coherent approach; \n 8.  Also requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2011 , a report on the state of conservation of the property and on the steps taken to implement the recommendations set out above, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 35th session in 2011,  with a view to considering, in the absence of substantial progress, the possible inscription of the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
