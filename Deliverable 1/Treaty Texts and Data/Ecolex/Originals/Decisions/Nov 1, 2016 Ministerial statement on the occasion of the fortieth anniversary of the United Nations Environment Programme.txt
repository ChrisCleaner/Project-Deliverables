The Governing Council\nAdopts the following statement:\n1. We, the ministers and heads of delegation of the United Nations Environment\nProgramme Global Ministerial Environment Forum, met in Nairobi from 20 to 22 February 2012 for\nthe twelfth special session of the Global Ministerial Environment Forum, celebrating the fortieth\nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme in 1972.\n2. We congratulate the United Nations Environment Programme on its successes and\neffective undertakings, in addition to the progress that has been achieved over the past 40 years,\nincluding the establishment of important multilateral environmental agreements, the development of\nenvironmental laws and policies, the findings of key scientific assessments and the stronger awareness\nof environmental issues at all levels.\n3. We recall our commitment to strengthening the role of the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme as the leading global environmental authority that sets the global\nenvironmental agenda, that promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimensions of\nsustainable development within the United Nations system and that serves as an authoritative advocate\nfor the global environment, as set out in the 1997 Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme.\n4. We recognize that we depend on natural systems and resources for our existence and,\nthe successes of the United Nations Environment Programme notwithstanding, we are deeply\nconcerned about continued environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the natural systems and\nresources on which we depend.\n5. We recognize the summary for policymakers of the fifth Global Environment Outlook\nassessment report as an important synthesis of scientific information on environment for policymakers\nand decision-makers about freshwater, biodiversity, climate change, land, chemicals and wastes,\nenergy and oceans and seas.\n6. We will therefore continue to strengthen our actions to reverse environmental\ndegradation, to promote a holistic approach to sustainable development and to contribute to the\nconservation of the essential natural resources and ecosystems on which our economies and societies\ndepend.\n7. We welcome the upcoming United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in\nJune 2012 as a unique opportunity to tackle economic, social and environmental challenges in the\ncontext of sustainable development and we commit ourselves to making the Conference a success.
