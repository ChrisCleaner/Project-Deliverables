30. Regarding voluntary contributions in particular, the Committee recalled that Article 16, paragraph 4 of the Convention, stipulates that these contributions "... shall be paid on a regular basis, at least every two years, and should not be less than the contributions which they (States Parties having opted for voluntary contributions) should have paid if they had been bound by the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article." (mandatory contributions amounting at present to 1% of the annual contribution of States Parties to Unesco). In this respect the Committee appreciated the presentation of the statement on voluntary contributions, as had been requested by the Bureau at its eighth session. \n 31. The Committee reminded States Parties which had opted for voluntary contributions that, in accordance with Article 16, paragraph 4 of the Convention, they had the moral obligation to pay a contribution equivalent to at least 1%. The Committee therefore appealed to such States Parties to take the necessary measures to meet this objective. At the same time, the Committee requested all States Parties making mandatory contributions to pay any amounts in arrears at the earliest possible moment and asked the Secretariat to remind these States Parties, as appropriate. \n 32. The Committee took note that the financial situation of the World Heritage Fund was somewhat more optimistic than had been foreseen at the time of the eighth session of the Bureau due to the fact that certain contributions had been paid since that date and the Secretariat, in accordance with the request of the Bureau, had made substantial savings on the 1.984 approved budget. The Committee noted that the actual amount of cash-in-hand at the time of its eighth session was estimated at approximately $830,000, that is, not taking account of receivable mandatory contributions or imminent payments. \n 33.
