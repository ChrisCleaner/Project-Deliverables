V.254&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Secretariat informed the Bureau that during the course of last year, it had received information informing of concern over the planned cruise-ship landing at Pointe-&agrave;-Carcy and its possible impact on the universal values of the Historic District of Quebec. In response, the Government of Canada, through Parks Canada, provided information on the process of consultation and assessment of the project and submitted substantive documentation on the project, on the results of the public consultations and on the cultural resource assessment that had been prepared under its leadership for the area concerned. \n V.255&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the documentation received by the Secretariat, it became evident that there is a considerable difference of opinion on the potential impact of the terminal, both visually and in terms of increased traffic in a neighboring residential area, as well as on the reversible and possibly temporary character of the terminal. \n V.256&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of this, the Bureau requested ICOMOS to undertake an assessment mission to the site and prepare a report for examination by the Bureau at its twenty-fifth extraordinary session. \n V.257&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Delegate of Canada stated that Canada is prepared to receive such a mission and will do all that is necessary to facilitate its undertaking.
