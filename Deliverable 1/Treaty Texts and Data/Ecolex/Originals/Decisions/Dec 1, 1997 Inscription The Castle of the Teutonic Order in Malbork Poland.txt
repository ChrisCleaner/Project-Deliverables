The Castle of the Teutonic Order in Malbork   \n  847   \n  Poland   \n  C(ii)(iii)(iv)   \n The Committee decided to inscribe this property on the basis of criteria (ii), (iii) and (iv), considering that Malbork Castle is the supreme example of the medieval brick castle that characterizes the unique architecture of the Crusading Teutonic Order in eastern Europe. It is also of considerable historical significance for the evidence that it provides of the evolution of the modern philosophy and practice of restoration and conservation. \n Following the inscription of these two properties from Poland, the Observer of Germany congratulated the Polish Government for the nominations and inscriptions of the Town of Torun and the Castle of Malbork which are representative of the common history of these two nations and which may be regarded as concrete evidence of the increasing spirit of cooperation and friendship (Statement annexed as Annex VI.1). \n The Observer of Poland expressed his thanks for the inscriptions and thanked the Observer of Germany for his kind intervention (Statement annexed as Annex V1.2). \n &nbsp;
