That the assessment referred to in paragraph 32 above will take place periodically starting four years from the hydrofluorocarbon freeze date and every four years thereafter;   34. To review, no later than the year following receipt of the first report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel on the suitability of alternatives, the need for an extension of the high\xe2\x80\x91ambient-temperature exemption for a further period of up to four years, and periodically thereafter, for specific sub-sectors in parties that meet the criteria set out in paragraph 29 above, and that parties will develop an expedited process for ensuring the renewal of the exemption in a timely manner where there are no feasible alternatives, taking into account the recommendation of the Panel and its subsidiary body;   35. That amounts of Annex F substances that are subject to the high-ambient-temperature exemption are not eligible for funding under the Multilateral Fund while they are exempted for that party;   36. That the Implementation Committee under the Non-Compliance Procedure of the Montreal Protocol and the Meeting of the Parties should, for 2025 and 2026, defer consideration of the hydrochlorofluorocarbon compliance status of any party operating under a high-ambient-temperature exemption in cases where it has exceeded its allowable consumption or production levels due to its HCFC-22 consumption or production for the sub-sectors listed in appendix I to the present decision, on the condition that the party concerned is following the phase-out schedule for consumption and production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons for other sectors and has formally requested a deferral through the Secretariat;   37. To consider, no later than 2026, whether to extend the compliance deferral referred to in paragraph 36 for an additional period of two years and, if appropriate, to consider further deferrals thereafter, for parties operating under the high-ambient-temperature exemption;   Other exemptions   38. To allow for other exemptions, such as for essential uses and critical uses, for production or consumption that is necessary to satisfy uses agreed by the parties to be exempted uses;   39.
