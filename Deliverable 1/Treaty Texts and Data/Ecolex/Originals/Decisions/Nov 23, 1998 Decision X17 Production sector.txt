The  Tenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. X/17:      Noting  the recent estimation by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel of high atmospheric emissions of carbon tetrachloride (almost 41,000 tonnes in 1996), out of which about 70 per cent was contributed by use of carbon tetrachloride as a feedstock to produce CFCs,     Noting  the assessment of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel that closure of CFC-manufacturing facilities in Article 5 Parties and Parties with economies in transition with accelerated introduction of alternatives could lead to a reduction in carbon tetrachloride emissions to the environment,     Noting  that the Ninth Meeting of the Parties requested the Executive Committee to accelerate the formulation of guidelines for funding the phase-out in the production sector and subsequent approval of relevant projects in this sector,     To request the Executive Committee to complete the task of formulation of guidelines for funding the production sector on a priority basis and expeditiously;   To further request the Executive Committee to facilitate the formulation of projects for funding the CFC-production sector and their subsequent approval on a priority basis.
