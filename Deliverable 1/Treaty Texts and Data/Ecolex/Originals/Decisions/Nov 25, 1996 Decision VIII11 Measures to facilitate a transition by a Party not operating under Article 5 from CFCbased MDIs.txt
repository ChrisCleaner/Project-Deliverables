The  Eighth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. VIII/11  to note that a transition is occurring from the use of CFC-based MDIs to non-CFC treatments for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In order to ensure a smooth and efficient transition, and protect the health and safety of patients, Parties not operating under Article 5 are encouraged:     To promote coordination between national environmental and health authorities on the environmental, health and safety implications of any proposed decisions on essential-use nominations and MDI transition policies;   To request their national authorities to expedite review of marketing/licensing/pricing applications of non-CFC treatments of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, provided that such expedited review does not compromise patient health and safety;   To request their national authorities to review the terms for public MDI procurement and reimbursement, so that purchasing policies do not discriminate against non-CFC alternatives.
