The Bureau recalled that at its twenty-first session it had requested the Park management to submit a map showing the proposed modification of the Park\'s boundaries to excise a 40 ha. area around the village of Zabljak, which had already been approved by the Government of the Republic of Montenegro. Furthermore, the Bureau had sought clarification from the Park authorities on whether they considered that an engineering evaluation of the earthen containment structures in the flood plains of the Tara River was needed. The Bureau had expressed its concerns regarding plans for tapping the hydropower potential of the Tara River and requested more information on such plans. \n By a letter dated 8 April 1998, the Durmitor National Park authorities have informed the Centre that the map showing the 40 ha area to be excised is under preparation and that documentation concerning other information requested by the Bureau had been submitted to the Federal Ministry for the Protection of the Environment. The Park authorities have pointed out that there is a global protection regime for the Tara River and its Canyon. The Centre has contacted the Permanent Delegation of the State Party in UNESCO and is awaiting the receipt of the documentation sent by the Park authorities to the Federal Ministry for the Protection of the Environment. \n The Bureau requested the Centre to write to the State Party to obtain further information on the global protection regime for the Tara River and Canyon and to provide a detailed report by 15 September 1998 in time for the twenty-second session of the World Heritage Committee.
