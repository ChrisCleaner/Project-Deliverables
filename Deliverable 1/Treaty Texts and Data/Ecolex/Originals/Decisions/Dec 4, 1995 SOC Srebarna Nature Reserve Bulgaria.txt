VII.3 Srebarna Nature Reserve (Bulgaria)   \n The committee recalled that the site was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1992 and that the Bureau at its nineteenth session examined a substantive state of conservation report, prepared by the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Bulgaria. \n The Representative of IUCN informed the committee that a monitoring mission was undertaken by the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention and a detailed monitoring report was prepared. This report indicates that the new water control structure allows an inflow of water on a small scale, and that a small colony of the Dalmatian Pelican had been reestablished. The integrity of the site, however, has not yet been adequately restored. \n The Committee took note of the report received from the Ramsar Secretariat and the comments made by IUCN. The Delegate of France supported the report presented. \n The Committee encouraged the Bulgarian authorities in their continuing efforts to restore the site, including increasing the water intake and the preparation of a management plan for the site. The Committee furthermore requested that a status report be presented in three years time. Meanwhile, the Committee decided to retain the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
