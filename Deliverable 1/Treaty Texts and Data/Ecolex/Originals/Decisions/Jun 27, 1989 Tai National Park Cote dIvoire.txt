The Bureau recalled that IUCN had reported on the deteriorating situation of this site on several occasions and that the Committee had requested the Ivoirian authorities to propose its inscription on the List of World Heritage in Danger. It noted that the Secretariat had contacted the Ivoirian authorities, but that only recently a response had been obtained in the form of a request for preparatory assistance in order to prepare a technical cooperation request for an integrated project addressing the need for increased protection of the natural values of this Park and also the socio-economic problems. The contribution of the World Heritage Fund would be used in a catalytic manner adding on to other funding sources such as UNDP. The Bureau requested the Secretariat to follow this matter and consult with IUCN in the preparation of the integrated project for technical cooperation.
