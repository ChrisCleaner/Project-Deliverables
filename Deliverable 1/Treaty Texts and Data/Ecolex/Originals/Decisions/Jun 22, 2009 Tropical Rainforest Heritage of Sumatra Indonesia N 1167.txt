The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-09/33.COM/7B . Add , \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  32 COM 7B.14 , adopted at its 32nd session (Quebec   City, 2008), \n 3.  Notes  that substantial progress has been made by the State Party in implementing the Emergency Action Plan, to improve the management of the property and address illegal logging and other illegal activities; \n 4.  Notes with extreme concern  that the property continues to face heavy pressure from illegal activities, including encroachment, which are a major threat to the integrity of the property, as confirmed by three monitoring missions since 2004; \n 5.  Calls upon  the State Party to take decisive action to secure the conservation of the property, including the demonstration of support from the highest national political level and from the World Heritage National Working Group, to achieve the actions needed to address the severe threats in the property; \n 6.  Requests  the State Party to strengthen its efforts to implement the Emergency Action Plan and to involve all relevant ministries and other stakeholders at both national and local levels; \n 7.  Urges  the State Party to update and further detail the Emergency Action Plan, to extend the timeframe to ten years and to address the following issues in particular: \n a) Establish an effective and prioritised monitoring system to assess the status and trends of key factors affecting the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, including wildlife populations, invasive species, deforestation, poaching, wildlife trade and any observed climate change and other environmental phenomena in all components of the property. This system should, as a priority, map in detail and monitor the encroachments in and around the property and assess their changes and impacts since the inscription of the property, \n b) Assess the feasibility to relocate and restore endangered species such as tiger and rhinoceros, following the relevant IUCN advice and guidelines, in cooperation with the relevant IUCN species specialist groups, \n c) Improve coordination with socio-economic development programmes and institutions to promote sustainable socio-economic activities in and around the property and ensure that they are fully compatible with maintaining the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, \n d) Close all illegal roads and develop appropriate regulations and infrastructure on existing legal public roads to reduce the negative impacts of traffic on wildlife and to ensure ecological connectivity, \n e) Note that the establishment of new provinces, districts and sub-districts in the property may add to the complexity of its management and increase threats from development, \n f) Support and strengthen the human resource capacities of the National Park Service of the property, in the field of social science and resource economy, \n g) Provide law enforcement agencies with adequate resources for expanding their law enforcement activities to encroachment and poaching, \n h) Develop and implement an ecosystem-based restoration plan of the degraded forests in the property and neighbouring landscape, \n i) Consider establishing an appropriate buffer zone or other measures to secure the conservation of the property; \n 8.  Takes note  of the recommendations made by the current and previous reactive monitoring missions (2006, 2007, 2009), to consider the extension of the property by including habitats considered as critical for the key species of the property, and  also takes note  that the 2009 mission concludes that there are some areas in the property that do not have Outstanding Universal Value and  recommends  that the State Party in cooperation with the World Heritage Centre and IUCN submit a proposal to the World Heritage Committee for significant modifications with adjusted boundaries to reflect the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n 9.  Invites  the State Party to submit an International Assistance request to obtain support for the implementation of the above recommendations, and  also requests  the World Heritage Centre to support the State Party in the elaboration of such a submission if requested; \n 10.  Further requests  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre/IUCN mission to the property in 2011 to assess the progress made in the implementation of the measures noted above; \n 11.  Requests   furthermorethe State  Party to urgently develop and submit to the World Heritage Centre by  1 February 2010  for consideration by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010; \n a) in consultation with the World Heritage Centre and Advisory Bodies, a draft Statement of Outstanding Universal Value; and \n b) a comprehensive report demonstrating how the State Party is addressing the Emergency Action Plan; \n 12.  Noting , in the absence of substantial demonstrated progress, the likely inscription of the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010, \n 13.  Taking note  of the efforts that have been made by the State Party in order to protect the Outstanding Universal Value of the property,  encourages  the State Party to continue with those efforts in consultation with the World Heritage Centre and the Advisory Bodies as well as with the support of the international community.
