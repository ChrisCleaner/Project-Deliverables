Recalling  decision XVII/19 which requested the Ozone Secretariat to organize an experts workshop on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change/Technology and Economic Assessment Panel special report in the margins of the twenty-sixth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group in 2006,   Noting with appreciation  Parties\' submissions for the list of practical measures as well as the preparations of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel for the workshop,    Noting   with appreciation  the report of the workshop provided by the Ozone Secretariat,   Noting with appreciation  the summary of Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion 2006 , and its options on additional measures to accelerate the recovery, but further noting with concern better scientific understanding now suggests a 10 to 15 year later return of chlorine levels to pre-1980 values in the atmosphere,   Noting with appreciation  the report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel Task Force on Emission Discrepancies,   Mindful  that Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol should phase out consumption of hydrochlorofluorocarbons by 2030 and freeze production by 2004 and that the Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 should phase out consumption of hydrochlorofluorocarbons by 2040 and freeze production by 2016,   Aware  of the potential implications of Clean Development Mechanism projects in hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22 production facilities,    Acknowledging,  therefore ,  that further work needs to be done to reach the targets of the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol for recovery of the ozone layer,  1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to further assess the measures listed in the report of Ozone Secretariat workshop on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change/Technology and Economic Assessment Panel special report, in the light of current and expected trends of ozone-depleting substance production and consumption and with a focus on hydrochlorofluorocarbons, taking into account timing, feasibility and environmental benefits in Parties operating under Article 5 and Parties not operating under Article 5 of the Protocol;  2. \xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to provide information on current and future demand for, and supply of, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, giving full consideration to the influence of the Clean Development Mechanism on hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22 production, as well as on the availability of alternatives to hydrochlorofluorocarbons;  3.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Ozone Secretariat to facilitate consultations, as appropriate, by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel with relevant organizations, namely, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Executive Board of Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, and the secretariat of the Multilateral Fund, to enable the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to draw on the work already carried out under these organizations, including any work relating to hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22, and consider, in cooperation with the Scientific Assessment Panel, the implications of these findings for the recovery of the ozone layer;  4.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to report its findings on the issues mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 above to the Open-ended Working Group at its twenty-seventh meeting for consideration, with a view to providing a final report to the Nineteenth Meeting of the Parties.
