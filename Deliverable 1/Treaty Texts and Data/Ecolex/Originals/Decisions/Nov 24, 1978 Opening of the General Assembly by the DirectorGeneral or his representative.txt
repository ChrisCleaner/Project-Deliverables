Makaminan Makagiansar, Assistant Director-General for Culture and Communication of Unesco, opened the meeting, and, on behalf of the Director General and himself, welcomed the delegates of States Parties and the other participants. He underlined the essential role of the  Convention  for the work of Unesco. Its objectives were, on the one hand, to preserve the testimony of man\'s creative genius and of the rich resources of nature, and, on the other hand, to help to improve the quality of life, and to promote cultural identity. Mr. Makagiansar then went on to review the progress achieved since the first General Assembly with respect to the implementation of the  Convention , noting with pleasure the increase in the number of States who had become Parties to the  Convention . He also informed the General Assembly of the work undertaken by the Committee since its inception. After expressing the hope that other States would join those who had already ratified or accepted the  Convention , he reminded the Assembly of the two principal tasks before it, namely the election of members of the Committee, and the determination of the amount of the contribution to the World Heritage fund, as foreseen in Article 16, paragraph 1, of the  Convention .
