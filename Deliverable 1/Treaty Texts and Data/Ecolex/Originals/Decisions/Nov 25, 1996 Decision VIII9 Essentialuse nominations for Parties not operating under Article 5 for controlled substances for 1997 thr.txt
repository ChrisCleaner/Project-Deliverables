The  Eighth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. VIII/9:      To note with appreciation the work done by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Technical Options Committees pursuant to decision IV/25 of the Fourth Meeting of the Parties and decisions VII/28 and VII/34 of the Seventh Meeting of the Parties;   That the levels of production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113 and CFC-114, for metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and nasal dexamethasone, and halon 2402 for fire protection are authorized as specified in annex II to the report of the Eighth Meeting of the Parties, subject to the conditions established by the Seventh Meeting of the Parties in paragraph 2 of its decision VII/28;   To correct the errors introduced by the reports of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Technical Options Committees in the United States MDI nomination of CFC-12 and CFC-114 for the production year 1997 and its nomination of methyl chloroform for the production years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 and to adjust the total amounts exempted to take into account the withdrawal of the New Zealand MDI nomination of CFC-11 and CFC-12 for production years 1996 and 1997, as specified in annex III to the report of the Eighth Meeting of the Parties;   That for 1998, for Parties not operating under Article 5 of the Protocol, production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances in Annexes A and B of the Protocol only for laboratory and analytical uses, as listed in annex IV to the report of the Seventh Meeting of the Parties, are authorized, subject to the conditions applied to exemption for laboratory and analytical uses as contained in annex II to the report of the Sixth Meeting of the Parties;   To permit the transfer of essential-use authorizations for MDIs for 1997 between New Zealand and Australia on a one-time basis only;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its relevant Technical Options Committee to investigate the implications of allowing greater flexibility in the transfer of essential-use authorizations between Parties;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its relevant Technical Options Committee to review and report, by 30 April 1997, on the implications of allowing the production of CFCs for medical applications on a periodic \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign basis\xe2\x80\x9d to satisfy estimated future needs, rather than producing small quantities in each year. Consideration should be given in particular to the economic implications of such an allowance;   To revise the timetables in decision IV/25, as modified by decision V/18, for nominations for production and consumption exemptions for 1998 and subsequent years, as follows: to set 31 January of each year as the last date for nominations for decisions to be taken in that year for production or consumption in any subsequent year; and to request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its relevant Technical Options Committees to develop recommendations on the nominations and submit their report through the Secretariat by 30 April of that year; however, for 1997 the report will be submitted by 1 April 1997;   To approve the format for reporting quantities and uses of ozone-depleting substances produced and consumed for essential uses as set out in annex IV to the report of the Eighth Meeting of the Parties and beginning in 1998 to request each of the Parties that have had essential-use exemptions granted for previous years, to submit their report in the approved format by 31 January of each year;   To allow the Secretariat, in consultation with the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, to authorize, in an emergency situation, if possible by transfer of essential-use exemptions, consumption of quantities not exceeding 20 tonnes of ODS for essential uses on application by a Party prior to the next scheduled Meeting of the Parties. The Secretariat should present this information to the next Meeting of the Parties for review and appropriate action by the Parties.
