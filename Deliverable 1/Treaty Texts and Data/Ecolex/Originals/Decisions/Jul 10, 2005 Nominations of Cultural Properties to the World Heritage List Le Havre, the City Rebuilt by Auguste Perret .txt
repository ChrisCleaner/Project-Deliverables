The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Having examined  Documents   WHC-05/29.COM/8B, WHC-05/29.COM/8B.Add 2   and   WHC-05/29.COM/INF.8B.1  ,  2.  Inscribes   Le Havre, the City rebuilt by Auguste Perret  (France) on the World Heritage List on the basis of cultural criteria (ii) and (iv):   Criterion (ii):  The post-war reconstruction plan of Le Havre is an outstanding example and a landmark of the integration of urban planning traditions and a pioneer implementation of modern developments in architecture, technology, and town-planning.   Criterion (iv):  Le Havre is an outstanding post-war example of urban planning and architecture based on the unity of methodology and system of prefabrication, the systematic use of a modular grid and the innovative exploitation of the potential of concrete.  3.  Recommends  that, taking note of the valuable experience in the construction using reinforced concrete and of the monitoring systems already adopted in Le Havre, these efforts be continued in a systematic manner within the programme of a specialised research centre for concrete;  4.  Also recommends  that, considering the need to maintain a high standard in the workmanship, repair and restoration of the structures of Le Havre, every effort be made to facilitate this process through effective sources of financial aid.
