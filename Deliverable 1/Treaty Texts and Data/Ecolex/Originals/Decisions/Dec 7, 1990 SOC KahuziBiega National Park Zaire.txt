Kahuzi-Biega National Park (Zaire)    \n The Committee expressed concern about the proposed construction of a highway along the existing line of a little-used old colonial road that crosses this park. If built, this highway would be the main link between the densely populated regions of the Great Lakes of Central Africa and the navigable part of the Zaire River. The Committee noted the existence of an alternative route to the north of Kahuzi-Biega and asked   that a comparative study of the two routes be conducted. The Committee instructed the Secretariat to inform the Zairian authorities and the German development assistance agency (KWF) of this request and to report to the Bureau on this issue at its next session. \n &nbsp;
