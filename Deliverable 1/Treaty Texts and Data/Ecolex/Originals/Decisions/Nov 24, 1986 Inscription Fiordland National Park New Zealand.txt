Fiordland National Park  \n  376  \n  New Zealand  \n  N(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)  \n The Committee noted the importance of including the waters of the fiords as an integral part of this national park and requested the New Zealand authorities to keep it informed of any reconside&shy;ration of the proposal to export fresh water from the area which has been currently withdrawn. The Committee welcomed the initiatives of the New Zealand authorities to bring the waters of the fiords under the control of the park and endorsed the efforts of the New Zealand Wildlife Service to rehabilitate takahe habitat and restore population numbers. The Committee also noted that the Waikutu Forest, if added to the park, would become an acceptable part of the World Heritage site and encouraged the State Party to implement the redevelopment plan for the Milford Area. \n &nbsp;
