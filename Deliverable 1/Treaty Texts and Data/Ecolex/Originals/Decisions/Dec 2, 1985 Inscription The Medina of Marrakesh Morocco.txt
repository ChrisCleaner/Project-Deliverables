In this connection it would be advisable to avoid any breaching of the ramparts, to protect carefully the medina and especially the facades of its buildings and its gardens, and also to ensure the protection of the surroundings of Marrakesh, in particular the palm grove, the Menara and the gardens of Bab Djedid, by strictly enforcing the management plan adopted in 1981. \n &nbsp;
