The  Conference of the Parties , in  Decision VCI/4 of its First Meeting , decided that the following activities shall be given priority in the research, observations and transfer of technology:     The atmospheric impact of potential substitutes for the controlled substances particularly with regard to their likely ozone depletion potential and their greenhouse warming potential;   Monitoring of the rarer trace gases in the troposphere and research on their interactions;   The Global Ozone Observing System should be expanded particularly in the tropics and in the Southern hemisphere. Special attention must be paid to ozone monitoring in Polar regions. Nations should make a long-term commitment to such monitoring programmes including making sufficient resources available appropriate to the effective operation;   Research on the human health and biological implications of ultraviolet radiation changes at the earth\'s surface. Particular attention must be given to the impact on food production in the developing world and to development of crop varieties resistant to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation;   Research into the effects on the atmosphere of potential ozone layer depleting gases, other than the controlled substances, for example methyl chloroform;   Studies on the social and economic effects of ozone depletion.
