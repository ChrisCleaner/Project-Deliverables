The Bureau noted that the international assistance to Puebla had been concluded and that the National Institute for Anthropology and History (INAH) in collaboration with the State Council for the Historical Centre of Puebla had prepared a  conservation plan and urban and architectural ordinance for the Paseo del Rio San Francisco in Puebla.  It requested the Mexican authorities to provide the Secretariat with the details of this plan for information. \n The Bureau took note of the intervention of the Observer of Mexico who stated that the results of the expert meeting on Indicators for Measuring the state of conservation of Historical Cities (Colonia del Sacramento, March 1998) provided valuable elements for the identification of the different values of historical cities and would contribute to their understanding and proper planning in a case such as Puebla. He suggested that it would be opportune to further explore the practical application of the results of this meeting. He informed that the works in Puebla are now advancing satisfactorily.
