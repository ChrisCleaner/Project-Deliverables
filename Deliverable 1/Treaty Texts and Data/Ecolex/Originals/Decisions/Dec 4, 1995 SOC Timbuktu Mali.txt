VII.28 Timbuktu (Mali)  \n The Committee was informed of the state of progress of the pilot project for the preservation of the three mosques of Timbuktu inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The first phase, which was carried out by the national authorities, will be followed in 1995 by the intervention of experts from ICCROM and CRATerre - EAG. This second phase should receive support from the World Heritage Fund. \n Having noted that the Mali authorities granted emergency assistance from the national budget to finance conservation work, the Committee endorsed the launching of a pilot project. It commended the Mali Government for its commitment in defining a coherent conservation policy, adapted to each one of the mosques, and for having financed emergency work. The Committee decided to maintain this property on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
