The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/26:      To note that, in accordance with decision XIV/18 of the Fourteenth Meeting of the Parties, Albania was requested to submit to the Implementation Committee a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance;   To note with appreciation Albania\xe2\x80\x99s submission of its plan of action, and to note further that, under the plan, Albania specifically commits itself:     To reducing CFC consumption from 69 ODP-tonnes in 2001 as follows:     To 68.0 ODP-tonnes in 2003;   To 61.2 ODP-tonnes in 2004;   To 36.2 ODP-tonnes in 2005;   To 15.2 ODP-tonnes in 2006;   To 6.2 ODP-tonnes in 2007;   To 2.2 ODP-tonnes in 2008;   To phasing out CFC consumption by 1 January 2009, as provided in the plan for reduction and phase out of CFC consumption, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To establishing, by 2004, a system for licensing imports and exports of ODS, including quotas;   To banning, by 2004, imports of ODS-using equipment;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 2 above should enable Albania to return to compliance by 2006, and to urge Albania to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase out consumption of ozone-depleting substances in Annex A, group I;   To monitor closely the progress of Albania with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of CFCs. To the degree that Albania is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Albania should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Albania, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of CFCs (that is, the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
