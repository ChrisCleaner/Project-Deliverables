The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Inscribes  the  Matobo Hills ,  Zimbabwe , on the World Heritage List on the basis of cultural criteria (iii), (v) and (vi):   Criterion (iii):  The Matobo Hills has one of the highest concentrations of rock art in southern Africa. The rich evidence from archaeology and from the rock paintings at Matobo provide a very full picture of the lives of foraging societies in the Stone Age and the way agricultural societies came to replace them.   Criterion (v):  The interaction between communities and the landscape, manifested in the rock art and also in the long standing religious traditions still associated with the rocks, are community responses to a landscape.    Criterion (vi):  The Mwari religion, centred on Matobo, which may date back to the Iron Age, is the most powerful oracular tradition in southern Africa.   2.
