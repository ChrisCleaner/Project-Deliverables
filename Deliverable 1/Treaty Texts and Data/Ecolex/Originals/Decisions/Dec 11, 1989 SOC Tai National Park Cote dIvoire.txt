Tai National Park   (Cote d\'Ivoire)  \n The Committee noted an earlier request that the Ivoirian authorities agree to this site\'s inscription on the List of World Heritage in Danger had brought no response. However, the Committee noted that only recently had the Secretariat received a response in the form of a request for preparatory assistance. This preparatory assistance could take the form of a workshop to evaluate the situation and revise a draft of an integrated project to safeguard this site, to be financed jointly by the World Heritage Fund (technical cooperation) and extra-budgetary resources. The Committee encouraged the Secretariat and IUCN to follow-up this matter and report back to the Bureau at its next session. \n &nbsp;
