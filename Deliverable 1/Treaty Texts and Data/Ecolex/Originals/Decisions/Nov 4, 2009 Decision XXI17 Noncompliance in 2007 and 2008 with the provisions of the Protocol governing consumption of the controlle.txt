Noting  that Bangladesh ratified the Montreal Protocol on 2 August 1990, the London Amendment on 18 March 1994, the Copenhagen Amendment on 27 November 2000 and the Montreal Amendment on 27 July 2001, and is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol,   Noting also  that the Executive Committee has approved $6,339,765 from the Multilateral Fund to enable Bangladesh\xe2\x80\x99s compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol,    That Bangladesh reported annual consumption for the controlled substances in Annex\xc2\xa0A, group I (chlorofluorocarbons), of 154.9 ODP-tonnes for 2007 and 158.3 ODP-tonnes for 2008, which exceeds the Party\xe2\x80\x99s maximum allowable consumption of 87.2 ODP-tonnes for those controlled substances for those years, and that the Party is therefore in non-compliance with the control measures for those substances under the Protocol for those years;   To note with appreciation Bangladesh\xe2\x80\x99s submission of a plan of action to ensure its prompt return to compliance with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s chlorofluorocarbon control measures under which, without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Protocol, Bangladesh specifically commits itself:     (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To reducing chlorofluorocarbon consumption to no greater than:       (i)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 140 ODP-tonnes in 2009;    (ii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Zero ODP-tonnes in 2010, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;      (b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To monitoring its system for licensing the import and export of ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances, including import quotas;     To urge Bangladesh to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement its plan of action to phase out consumption of chlorofluorocarbons;    To monitor closely the progress of Bangladesh with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons. To the degree that the Party is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Bangladesh should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance;    To caution Bangladesh, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance, that in the event that it fails to return to compliance the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article\xc2\xa04, such as ensuring that the supply of chlorofluorocarbons that are the subject of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance is ceased so that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance;
