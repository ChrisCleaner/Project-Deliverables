A mission sent by the World Heritage Centre in November 1998 to Sana&rsquo;a had reported that there were plans for the extension of the Great Mosque of Sana&rsquo;a and for the construction of a large fly-over between the two parts of the city.&nbsp; The twenty-second extraordinary session of the Bureau (November 1998) recommended that work on these two projects should be halted pending a global study on the development of Sana&rsquo;a.&nbsp; This was communication to the authorities in January 1999.&nbsp; The Secretariat informed the Bureau that the extension of the Grand Mosque has been abandoned.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Observer of Yemen provided additional information on the flyover, the length of which had been reduced.&nbsp; Consequently, the Bureau requested the Yemeni authorities to collaborate with the Secretariat in studying the holistic management of the site before works began.&nbsp; The Bureau also requested the authorities to receive at their earliest convenience a mission of specialists to study together alternative solutions for the development projects.&nbsp; This mission should report to the forthcoming session of the World Heritage Committee.
