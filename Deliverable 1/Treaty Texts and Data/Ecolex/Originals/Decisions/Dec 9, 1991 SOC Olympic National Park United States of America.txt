Olympic National Park (United States of America)  \n The Delegate of the United States of America informed the Committee that on 22 July 1991, a Japanese fishing vessel and a Chinese freighter collided off the Olympic Peninsula resulting in a spill of 70,000 gallons of oil. Coastal areas impacted by the oil spill include those within the National Park. An estimated 40-60% of the beaches were affected by the oil spill with short-term effects seen in the loss of sea birds, sea otters, bald eagles and other beach scavengers. These effects appear to have lessened and have been documented through the emergency response mechanism which was established following a similar, but more damaging oil spill in 1987. Long-term effects of the spill are not precisely known and the Delegate assured the Committee that: he will advise the Committee as information becomes available and will also share information on the emergency response mechanism. \n &nbsp;
