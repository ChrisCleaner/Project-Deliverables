The Bureau noted that the Tasmanian Regional Forestry Agreement (RFA) signed by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments on 8 November 1997, has enabled the following: \n \n establishment of a significantly increased reserve system for Tasmania&rsquo;s Forest Estate; \n participation by the signatories in further World Heritage assessment of relevant Australia-wide themes; and \n initiation of discussions between the signatories on possibilities for further World Heritage nominations of parts of Forest Estate as &ldquo;Dedicated Reserves&rdquo;, or additions to the present World Heritage site. \n \n The Bureau requested the State Party to keep the Centre informed of any potential boundary extensions that may be foreseen for the Tasmanian Wilderness and to provide a timetable for the implementation of the Regional Forestry Agreement, including possible boundary extensions to the World Heritage site.
