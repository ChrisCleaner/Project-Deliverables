XVIII.1  The Committee examined the proposals contained in Document WHC-96/CONF.201/19 to ensure the continuing legality for the functioning of the Bureau following each General Assembly of States Parties until the election of the new Bureau. \n  XVIII.2  The Committee decided to modify Rule 12.1 of the Rules of Procedure as follows: \n  "The Committee, at the beginning of each ordinary session, shall elect a Chairman, five Vice-Chairmen and a Rapporteur, who shall remain in office until the beginning of the next ordinary session. When its December session precedes the year when the General Assembly will be held, the Committee will decide to meet very briefly in an extraordinary session at the end of the General Assembly in order to elect its new Bureau, so that this Bureau can meet the following month, prior to the Committee, in all legality."  \n &nbsp;
