Noting with appreciation  the work of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee,    Recognizing  the significant reductions in critical-use nominations for methyl bromide by many parties,    Recalling  paragraph 10 of decision XVII/9,    Recalling also  that all parties that have nominated critical-use exemptions are to report data on stocks of methyl bromide using the accounting framework agreed to by the Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties,    Recognizing  that the production and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses should be permitted only if methyl bromide is not available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled methyl bromide,    Recognizing also  that parties operating under critical-use exemptions should take into account the extent to which methyl bromide is available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled methyl bromide in licensing, permitting or authorizing the production and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses,    Recalling  decision Ex.I/4, by which parties with critical-use exemptions were requested to submit annual accounting frameworks,    Noting  the progress made under the research programme of the Australian strawberry runner industry and that Australia is planning to move to alternatives if trials in 2018 and 2019 are successful and the registration of the alternatives is completed,    Noting also  the progress made under the Canadian research programme and the commitment of Canada to submitting a progress report before the fortieth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group,    Noting with appreciation  that China does not intend to submit further nominations for critical\xe2\x80\x91use exemptions,   1. To permit, for the agreed critical-use categories for 2018 and 2019 set forth in table A of the annex to the present decision for each party, subject to the conditions set forth in the present decision and in decision Ex.I/4, to the extent that those conditions are applicable, the levels of production and consumption for 2018 and 2019 set forth in table B of the annex to the present decision, which are necessary to satisfy critical uses, with the understanding that additional production and consumption and categories of use may be approved by the Meeting of the Parties in accordance with decision IX/6;   2. That parties shall endeavour to license, permit, authorize or allocate quantities of methyl bromide for critical uses as listed in table A of the annex to the present decision;   3. That each party that has an agreed critical-use exemption shall renew its commitment to ensuring that the criteria in paragraph 1 of decision IX/6, in particular the criterion laid down in paragraph 1 (b) (ii) of decision IX/6, are applied in licensing, permitting or authorizing critical uses of methyl bromide, with each party requested to report on the implementation of the present provision to the Secretariat by 1 February for the years to which the present decision applies;   4. That parties submitting future requests for critical-use nominations for methyl bromide shall also comply with paragraph 1 (b) (iii) of decision IX/6 and that parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 shall demonstrate that research programmes are in place to develop and deploy alternatives to and substitutes for methyl bromide;    Annex to decision XXIX/6    Table A    Agreed critical-use categories    (tonnes) a        2019   \xc2\xa0       Australia   Strawberry runners 28.98       2018   \xc2\xa0       Argentina   Strawberry fruit 29.0  Tomatoes 47.7       Canada   Strawberry runners (Prince Edward Island) 5.261       China   Ginger, open field 68.88  Ginger, protected 18.36       South Africa   Mills 2.9  Houses 42.75        a  Tonnes = metric tons.
