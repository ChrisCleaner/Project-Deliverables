The  Fourteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XIV/5:     Noting  that while the transition to chlorofluorocarbon-free (CFC-free) alternative treatments for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) depends largely on non-Article 5(1) Parties adopting effective transition strategies and CFC metered-dose inhaler manufacturers diligently developing, seeking approval for, and launching CFC-free metered-dose inhalers and dry-powder inhalers;    Noting  with concern the slow transition to CFC-free metered-dose inhalers in some Parties, and the need for affordable and available alternatives in Parties operating under Article 5(1);    Recognizing  the desirability of a more transparent presentation of data to assist Parties in better understanding essential use CFC volumes and gauging progress on, and impediments to, the transition;     To request each Party or regional economic integration organization to submit available information to the Ozone Secretariat by 28 February 2003 and annual updates thereafter the following information concerning inhaler treatments for asthma and COPD that contain CFCs or that do not contain CFCs:     CFC and non-CFC metered-dose inhalers and dry-powder inhalers: sold or distributed within the Party, by active ingredient, brand/manufacturer, and source (import or domestic production);   CFC and non-CFC metered-dose inhalers and dry-powder inhalers: produced within the Party for export to other Parties, by active ingredient, brand/manufacturer, source and importing Party;   Non-CFC metered-dose inhalers and dry-powder inhalers: date approved, authorized for marketing, and/or launched in the territory of the Party;     To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to take into account information submitted pursuant to paragraph 1 and other available information in its annual assessment, and to request the Parties to pay due consideration to this information when reviewing their national transition strategies.
