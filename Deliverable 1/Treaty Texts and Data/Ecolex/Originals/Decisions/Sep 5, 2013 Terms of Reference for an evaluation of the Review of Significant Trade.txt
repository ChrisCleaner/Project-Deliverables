xc2\xa0           Objectives          1   The objectives of the evaluation of the Review of Significant Trade are to:       \xc2\xa0   a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0evaluate the contribution of the Review of Significant Trade to the implementation of Article IV, paragraphs 2 (a), 3 and 6 (a);       \xc2\xa0   b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0assess the impact over time of the actions taken in the context of the Review of Significant Trade on the trade and conservation status of species selected for review and subject to recommendations, taking into consideration the possible effects of these measures on other CITES-listed species;       \xc2\xa0   c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0formulate recommendations in view of the results and findings of the evaluation and the impact assessment; and       \xc2\xa0   d)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0prepare a document on the evaluation of the Review of Significant Trade and the resulting conclusions and recommendations for consideration at the first appropriate meeting of the Conference of the Parties.         Process          2   The evaluation will commence immediately after the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties, contingent on the availability of sufficient funds to ensure its completion.       3   The Animals and Plants Committees will oversee the evaluation, which will be administered by the Secretariat. Consultants may be engaged to assist it in this regard.       4   A working group composed of members of the Animals and Plants Committees, Parties, the Secretariat and invited experts will be responsible for advising on the evaluation process, reviewing the findings of associated research and developing recommendations for wider consideration by the Parties.       5   The Secretariat will regularly report on the progress of the evaluation at meetings of the Animals and Plants Committees.       6   A final report, which may include proposed amendments to existing Resolutions or Decisions, or other recommendations, and which will incorporate the comments of the Animals and Plants Committees and of range States addressed in the report, will be submitted by the Chairmen of the Animals and Plants Committees for consideration at a future meeting of the Conference of the Parties. The Chairman of the Animals or Plants Committee may submit an interim report to the Standing Committee when appropriate and considered useful.         Content of the evaluation          7   The evaluation of the Review of Significant Trade should include the following activities:       \xc2\xa0   a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0assess:       \xc2\xa0   i)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0the process used to select species for review (including the reliance on numerical data), and the species selected as a result;       \xc2\xa0   ii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0the process and means used to compile and review information concerning the implementation of Article IV, paragraphs 2 (a), 3 and 6 (a), for the selected species (including communications with the range States), and the subsequent use of this information by the Animals and Plants Committees for the categorization of species and the issuance of recommendations;       \xc2\xa0   iii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0the types and frequency of recommendations made;       \xc2\xa0   iv)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0the nature and rate of responses to recommendations, and problems identified;       \xc2\xa0   v)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0the use of the recommendations by range States as guidance for managing target species and other CITES-listed species with similar characteristics;       \xc2\xa0   vi)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0the nature and scale of the support provided to range States for implementing the recommendations, including field projects, financial aid and assistance in building local capacities;       \xc2\xa0   vii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0the ongoing process to monitor and review the implementation of recommendations, having regard to differing points of view as to where this responsibility should lie; and       \xc2\xa0   vii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0the impacts of the process on other aspects of CITES implementation, including how problems identified in the course of the review but not directly related to the implementation of Article IV, paragraphs 2 (a), 3 and 6 (a), were addressed;       \xc2\xa0   b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0conduct case studies of a representative range of species and countries subject to recommendations to assess subsequent short- and long-term changes, and whether these could be attributed to the process, in:       \xc2\xa0   i)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0conservation status of the target taxa in the range States;       \xc2\xa0   ii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0trade volumes and patterns of the target taxa, considering trade involving the range States subject to recommendations, other range States and non-range States;       \xc2\xa0   iii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0production or management strategies for the target taxa;       \xc2\xa0   iv)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0market developments of conservation relevance (such as shifts in supply or demand);       \xc2\xa0   v)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0costs and benefits associated with the management of and trade in the target taxa (such as the effects of trade suspensions and export quotas, shift in trade to non-CITES species or increased illegal trade);       \xc2\xa0   vi)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0protection status of the target taxa within range States, and regulatory measures outside range States;       \xc2\xa0   vii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0trade patterns, conservation status and management for other CITES-listed species that might be suitable \xe2\x80\x98substitutes\xe2\x80\x99 for the target taxa; and       \xc2\xa0   vii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0changes in conservation policies in range States; and       \xc2\xa0   c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0analyse the information to assess the effectiveness, costs and benefits   6   of the Review of Significant Trade as implemented so far, by reference to the cost of the process and the time it takes, and identify means to improve the contribution it makes to the objectives of the Convention by reducing the threats to wild species.                 5       Note from the Secretariat: this Annex was adopted at the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties.          6       The phrase \'effectiveness, costs and benefits\' is intended to address issues such as whether or not the funds spent on the process give value for money comparable to that for other CITES activities, and whether the time-scale envisaged in the process is too long for species that are in rapid decline.
