The World Heritage Centre informed the Bureau that it undertook a mission in March 1995 to assist the national authorities in preparing the state of conservation reports on the World Heritaqe cultural-properties in Pakistan. \n The mission benefitted from the 15th meeting of the International Consultative Committee (ICC) for the Safeguarding Campaign for Moenjodaro, launched in 1974, to gather information for a monitoring report on this site currently under preparation in collaboration with and at the request of the national authorities. Amongst the observations made were: (i) the need to ensure the sustainability of activities presently funded by UNDP and the UNESCO/Japan Funds-in-Trust by integrating the national experts trained under these projects as staff of the Department of Archaeology and Museums; (ii) clarification of the division of responsibilities between the various government entities dealing with the protection and conservation of Moenjodaro; (iii) cost-benefit appraisal of the electricity-generated water pumping work to lower the water table intended to protect the sub-surface archaeological remains; (iv) need for an international technical adviser based in Moenjodaro or in Karachi to provide more regular advice to the on-site conservation team. \n The Centre reported that the ICC expressed concern over the damage caused to the original walls by heavy rainfall in 1994, but noted that the recent protection measures applied were successful in limiting the damage. \n The Bureau, having noted the concerns raised at the 15th meeting of the Moenjodaro ICC, recommended that UNESCO strengthen its support to the Pakistani authorities over the next two years to enable the termination of the International Campaign as requested by the 25th Session of the General Conference of UNESCO. The Bureau suggested that UNESCO and the national authorities concerned, review the eventual need for the nomination of an international expert based in Karachi or in Moenjodaro for the duration of the remaining period of the Campaign and if affirmative, seek funding to finance the consultant post.
