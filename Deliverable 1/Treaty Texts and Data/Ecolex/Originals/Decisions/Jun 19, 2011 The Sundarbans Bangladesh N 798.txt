Notes with satisfaction  the initiation of the Sundarbans Environmental and Livelihoods Security project, which includes support for ecological monitoring and documenting the impacts of climate change on the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, and  welcomes  the State Party\'s commitment to expand its coastal greenbelt zone through mangrove afforestation as a mitigation measure to climate change; \n 4.
