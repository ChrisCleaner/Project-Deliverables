The World Heritage Committee, \n 1. Having examined Documents  WHC-08/32.COM/8B.Add  and  WHC-08/32.COM/INF.8B1.Add,  \n 2. Inscribes the  Bah&aacute;\'i Holy Places in Haifa and Western Galilee,   Israel , on the World Heritage List on the basis of  criteria (iii)  and  (vi) ; \n 3. Adopts the following Statement of Outstanding Universal Value: \n Bah&aacute;\'i Holy Places demonstrate Outstanding Universal Value for the Holy shrine of Bah&aacute;\'u\'ll&aacute;h and the Holy shrine of the B&aacute;b, as the most holy places of the Bah&aacute;\'&iacute; faith provide an exceptional testimony to the strong traditions of Bah&aacute;\'&iacute; pilgrimage which have grown up over the last century and draw large numbers of followers from around the world. They also have a profound meaning and value for followers of the Bah&aacute;\'&iacute; faith as sacred sites linked to the faith\'s two founders. \n  Criterion (iii) : The Holy shrine of Bah&aacute;\'u\'ll&aacute;h and the Holy shrine of the B&aacute;b, as the most holy places of the Bah&aacute;\'&iacute; faith, and visited by thousands of pilgrims each year from around the world, provide an exceptional testimony to, and are powerful communicators of, the strong cultural tradition of Bah&aacute;\'&iacute; pilgrimage. \n  Criterion (vi) : The two holy Bah&aacute;\'&iacute; shrines are tangible places of great meaning for one of the world\'s religions. \n The property demonstrates integrity linked to the history and spiritual home of the Bah&aacute;\'&iacute; faith and it demonstrates authenticity as tangible expression of the body of doctrine and system of values and beliefs that form the Bah&aacute;\'&iacute; faith. \n The legal protection of the nominated areas and their buffer zones will be improved once the TAMA 35 provisions come into force for Haifa. Conservation approaches are appropriate and the management system for the property provides high quality management. \n 4. Recommends that, in order to reinforce the protection of the properties, measures should be put in place to mitigate adequately the effects of urban development.
