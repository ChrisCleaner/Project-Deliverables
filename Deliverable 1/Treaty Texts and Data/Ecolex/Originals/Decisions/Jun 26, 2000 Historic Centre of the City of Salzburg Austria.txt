The Bureau noted the advice of ICOMOS that the proposed construction of a sports stadium at some three kilometres from the World Heritage city of Salzburg would not have an adverse impact on the World Heritage site and that there would be no direct line of sight between the two. The Observer of Austria confirmed the view of ICOMOS. The Bureau, however, requested the Austrian authorities to submit this view in writing by 15 September 2000 so that at its twenty-fourth extraordinary session the Bureau could be informed accordingly.
