The Rapporteur informed the Committee that, with the addition of the twenty-six properties approved by the Committee during its fifth session, a total of 112 cultural and natural properties had so far been included in the World Heritage List. The list of properties inscribed should be widely disseminated and it would be necessary, for this purpose, to decide whether the properties should be grouped by category and, if so, what categories should be established. The representative of the Director-General stated that, according to the terms of the Convention, it was for the Committee to establish the form in which the List should be published and that it was therefore for the Committee to take a decision on this question before the List was distributed ; he added that no official list had been distributed by the Director-General or the Secretariat. It was therefore decided that the Bureau, at its next meeting, would take up this question and formulate recommendations to the Committee.
