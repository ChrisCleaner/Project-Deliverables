The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Documents  WHC-09/33.COM/8B  and  WHC-09/33.COM/INF.8B1.Add , \n 2.  Refers  the examination of the proposed buffer zones for the  Medina of Sousse ,  Tunisia , back to the State Party to allow it to: \n a) Consider the enlargement of the buffer zone so as to effectively and adequately conserve and protect the property. The State Party may wish to extend the buffer zone to 200m beyond the ramparts, where possible, thus following the requirements of the Heritage regulations and the listing of the ramparts as "monument historique" (Decree of 25 January 1922); \n b) Precisely identify regulatory measures to mitigate the impact of interventions at historic monuments and of new developments on the integrity of the property. Intersectorial management arrangements should also be explored to ensure the implementation of said regulations by all stakeholders involved in the conservation and management of the property.
