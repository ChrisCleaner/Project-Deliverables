The  Ninth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. IX/9:      To recommend that each Party adopt legislative and administrative measures, including labelling of products and equipment, to regulate the export and import, as appropriate, of products, equipment, components and technology whose continuing functioning relies on supply of substances listed in Annexes A and B of the Montreal Protocol, in order to avert any adverse impact associated with the export of such products and equipment using technologies that are or will soon be obsolete because of their reliance on Annex A or Annex B substances and which would be inconsistent with the spirit of the Protocol, including decision 1/12 C of the First Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol, held in Helsinki in 1989;   To recommend to non-Article 5 Parties to adopt appropriate measures to control, in cooperation with the importing Article 5 Parties, the export of used products and equipment, other than personal effects, whose continuing functioning relies on supply of substances listed in Annexes A and B of the Montreal Protocol;   To recommend to Parties to report to the Tenth Meeting of the Parties on actions taken to implement the present decision.
