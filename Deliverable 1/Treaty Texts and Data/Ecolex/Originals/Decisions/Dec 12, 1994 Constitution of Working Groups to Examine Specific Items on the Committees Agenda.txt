VI.1  In order to facilitate and speed up the work of the Committee, the Chairperson proposed that two work groups be constituted, one on the World Heritage Fund, the 1995 budget and the further development of the World Heritage Centre, and the other group on the revision of Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the Convention. Upon the suggestion of the Delegate of France, it was agreed that each delegation may participate in the work of both groups if it so wishes. The Committee then approved the Delegate of the United States of America, Mr Robert Milne, as Chairperson of the first work group, and Ms Olga Pizano, Delegate of Colombia, as Chairperson of the second work group. The reports of the two work groups would be discussed by the Committee towards the end of the session. \n &nbsp;
