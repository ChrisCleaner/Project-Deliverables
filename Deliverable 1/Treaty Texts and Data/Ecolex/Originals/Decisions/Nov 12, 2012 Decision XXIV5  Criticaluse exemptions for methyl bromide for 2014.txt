Noting with appreciation  the work of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee,    Recognizing  the significant reductions made in critical-use nominations for methyl bromide in many parties,    Recalling  paragraph 10 of decision XVII/9,    Recalling also  that all parties that have nominated critical-use exemptions are to report data on stocks using the accounting framework agreed to by the Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties,    Recognizing  that the production and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses should be permitted only if methyl bromide is not available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled methyl bromide,    Recognizing also  that parties operating under critical-use exemptions should take into account the extent to which methyl bromide is available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled methyl bromide in licensing, permitting or authorizing the production and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses ,     Recognizing also  that Australia will not seek any further critical-use nominations of methyl bromide for use in the rice sector and therefore that the approval to use part of its 2014 allocation in 2013 is to be seen as exceptional and non-recurring,    Noting  that soilless systems for strawberry runners are not yet fully economically or technically feasible throughout Australia and Canada,    Noting also  that the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee has a \xe2\x80\x9cbottom up\xe2\x80\x9d approach for calculating the area concerned by methyl bromide in California in the United States of America and that the regulatory authorities have a \xe2\x80\x98top down\xe2\x80\x99 approach and that these varying approaches give rise to a difference of 150 hectares,    Acknowledging  that the Technical and Economic Assessment Panel, and specifically its Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee, produce reports that are science based, independent and robust and that all Parties should strive to respect the results of this work,   1. To permit, for the agreed critical-use categories for 2014 set forth in table A of the annex to the present decision for each party, subject to the conditions set forth in the present decision and in decision Ex.I/4 to the extent that those conditions are applicable, the levels of production and consumption for 2014 set forth in table B of the annex to the present decision, which are necessary to satisfy critical uses, with the understanding that additional levels of production and consumption and categories of use may be approved by the Meeting of the Parties in accordance with decision IX/6;   2. As part of a final transition out of the rice sector, to approve Australia bringing forward up to 1.187 tonnes of methyl bromide from its critical use exemption to 2013 for fumigating packaged rice, with any quantity brought forward to 2013 deducted from its allocation in 2014 and for Australia to ensure that this amount is reported in full transparency to the Ozone Secretariat;   3. That parties shall endeavour to license, permit, authorize or allocate quantities of methyl bromide for critical uses as listed in table A of the annex to the present decision;   4. To recognize the continued contribution of the expertise of the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee and to agree that in accordance with section 4.1 of the terms of reference of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel the Committee should ensure that it develops its recommendations in a consensus process that includes full discussion among all available Committee members and should ensure that members with relevant expertise are involved in developing its recommendations;   5. That each party that has an agreed critical-use exemption shall renew its commitment to ensuring that the criteria in paragraph 1 of decision IX/6, in particular the criterion laid down in paragraph 1 (b) (ii) of decision IX/6, are applied in licensing, permitting or authorizing critical uses of methyl bromide, with each party requested to report on the implementation of the present provision to the Ozone Secretariat by 1 February for the years to which the present decision applies;   6. To request that Canada and Australia take all reasonable steps to explore further the possibility of transitioning to technically and economically feasible alternatives, including soilless culture in the case of strawberry runners and to ensure that the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee is fully aware of these efforts;   7. To request that the United States of America takes all reasonable steps to explore further the possibility of transitioning to technically and economically feasible alternatives in the case of strawberry fruits and to ensure that the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee is fully aware of these efforts;   8 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to ensure that its consideration of nominations analyse the impact of national, subnational and local regulations and law on the potential use of methyl bromide alternatives and to include a description of the analysis in the critical use nomination report;   9. To urge parties operating under critical-use exemptions to put in place effective systems to discourage the accumulation of methyl bromide produced under the exemptions;        Annex to decision XXIV/5 : Critical use exemptions   Table A Agreed critical-use categories for 2014    (Metric tonnes)       Australia   Strawberry runners (29.760), rice (1.187)       Canada   Mills (5.044), strawberry runners (Prince Edward Island) (5.261)       United States of America   Commodities (0.740), mills and food processing structures (22.800), cured pork (3.730), strawberry \xe2\x80\x93 field (415.067)       Table B  Permitted levels of production and consumption for 2014    (Metric tonnes)       Australia   30.947       Canada   10.305       United States of America   442.337 a         a  Minus available stocks.
