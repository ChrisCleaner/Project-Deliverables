Aware  that parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer are taking measures to reduce and eventually eliminate the production and consumption of the ozone-depleting substances listed in Annex C, group I (hydrochlorofluorocarbons),    Recognizing  a need for continued consideration of issues related to hydrochlorofluorocarbons as indicated in paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 of decision XIX/6, and taking into consideration the report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel prepared in response to decisions XXVII/5 and XXVIII/8,    Noting  that the Halons Technical Options Committee considers it possible that certain aircraft rescue and firefighting applications may continue to need clean agents between 2020 and 2030,    Noting also  that the Medical and Chemicals Technical Options Committee has identified certain hydrochlorofluorocarbons used as solvents for which there may be a continued need in certain precision cleaning applications and manufacturing processes,    Recalling  the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol for adjustments and reductions in production and consumption of controlled substances,   1. To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, in relation to Annex C, group I, substances, to assess requirements for the period from 2020 to 2030 for parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and to provide information on the following:   (a) Areas and volumes of possible needs in fire suppression sectors that may require the use of clean agents;   (b) Areas and volumes of possible needs for solvent applications, including servicing;   (c) Areas and volumes of possible other niche uses;   (d) Existing or emerging applications and processes for alternatives related to items (a) to (c) above and the possibility of meeting identified needs through the use of recycled or reclaimed hydrochlorofluorocarbons;   2. To invite parties and other interested entities to provide additional information to the Secretariat by 15 January 2018 for inclusion in the Panel\xe2\x80\x99s progress report;   3. To request the Panel to report on the assessment referred to above by 15 March 2018;
