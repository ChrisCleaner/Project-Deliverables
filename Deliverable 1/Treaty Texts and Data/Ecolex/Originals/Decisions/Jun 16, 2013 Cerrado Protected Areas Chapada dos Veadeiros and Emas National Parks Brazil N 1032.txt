The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.&nbsp;   Having examined   Document WHC-13/37.COM/7B.Add, \n 2.&nbsp;   Recalling   Decision   36 COM 7B.30   , adopted at its 36th&nbsp;session (Saint-Petersburg, 2012), \n 3.&nbsp;   Reiterates its concern   that the majority of the Chapada dos Veadeiros component of this serial property continues to no longer benefit from National Park status, and that its integrity is no longer guaranteed; \n 4.&nbsp;   Recognizes   the positive actions undertaken by the State Party to develop new conservation units to restore some of the legal protection that has been lost, and   notes   that the process of putting in place effective protection and management, based on due public consultation, is taking more time than previously anticipated; \n 5.&nbsp;   Considers   that the possible boundary changes currently being considered by the State Party would represent a major boundary modification, and will require a re-nomination, as per Paragraph 165 of the   Operational Guidelines   ; \n 6.&nbsp;   Reminds   the State Party that until such a re-nomination is presented for consideration by the World Heritage Committee, the property as it is currently recognized under the   World Heritage Convention   is no longer afforded the full benefit of an adequate legal protective status, and therefore is regarded as being in potential danger in line with Paragraph 180 (b)(i) of the   Operational Guidelines   ; \n 7.&nbsp;   Also c     onsiders   that if significant progress to address the lack of protection of parts of the property has not been achieved by the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee, or in case of the emergence of a significant threat to the property before that time, the property will be considered for inscription on the List of World Heritage in Danger; \n 8.&nbsp;   Requests   the State Party to finalize the establishment of new conservation units within and outside the property before the end of 2013, taking into consideration the following criteria: \n a)&nbsp; the need to ensure optimal public consultation with all affected land owners, and promote and support the establishment of private natural heritage reserves, \n b)&nbsp; the application of management regimes that ensure the best possible protection of biodiversity and ecological processes, and ensure full collaboration in management between Federal and State agencies, as well as private owners. In case the proposed management regimes do not guarantee integral protection of Outstanding Universal Value (OUV), additional regulations need to be put in place, \n c)&nbsp; consider extending the property to include the areas within and outside the property with the best status of conservation, prioritizing the area of Rio das Pedras (within the property), S&atilde;o Bartolomeu, the area of Rio dos Couros (south of the property) and the area of R&iacute;os Macaco and Macaquinho (within and outside the property); \n 9.&nbsp;   Also requests   the State Party to fully implement all the other recommendations of the 2013 IUCN reactive monitoring mission; \n 10.&nbsp;   Further requests   the State Party to submit, by   1 February 2015,   in line with Paragraph 165 of the   Operational Guidelines   , a major boundary modification for consideration by the World Heritage Committee, that will include additional lands of conservation value not currently included in the property, and result in a property that meets all requirements of OUV, including effective protection and management; \n 11.&nbsp;   Requests furthermore   the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by   1 February 2014   , a report on the state of conservation of the property, including a report on the state of advancement of the re-nomination, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 39th session in 2015.
