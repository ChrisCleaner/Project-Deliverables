The Bureau recalled that when this site was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1988, several members of the Committee had registered their reservations as to its state of conservation and several threats to its integrity. The Bureau was concerned that despite assurances given to the Committee at the time of its inscription and the US$27 million EEC project in the region, the deterioration of the property had continued and this site still does not have a management plan. The Bureau took note of the intention of the President of the Central African Republic to transfer the management of the site to a private foundation and of the invitation made to UNESCO to participate, as a scientific body, in the management of the site by this foundation. The Bureau requested the World Heritage Centre to study this proposal, together with IUCN, and undertake a detailed analysis of the implications of the transfer of management of the site to a private foundation. The Bureau requested the World Heritage Centre to contact the State Party to know whether the national authorities would invite an expert mission to review the state of conservation of this Park and assess the proposal to lease its management to a private organization. The Bureau emphasized that such a mission should build upon the recent project audit carried out by the EEC and present recommendations on the future viability and management of this site.
