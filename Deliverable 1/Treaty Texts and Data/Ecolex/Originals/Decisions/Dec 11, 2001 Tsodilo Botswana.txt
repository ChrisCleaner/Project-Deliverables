The representative of ICOMOS explained that criterion (i) was applicable to the rock art. \n The Chairperson congratulated Botswana on the inscription of its first site on the World Heritage List. The Observer of Botswana emphasized that this is a milestone, illustrating the commitment of her county to fulfil the obligations of the Convention and to adhere to the Global Strategy. \n &nbsp;
