The UNESCO Representative in Mozambique would be a member of this Committee. The Mozambique authorities and UNESCO plans to allocate resources which will be used to implement the integrated rehabilitation programme defined in the report. \n The Committee noted the creation of a Fund-in-Trust to finance conservation projects in the framework of the rehabilitation programme of the Ihla as prepared by UNESCO. The Committee requested the World Heritage Centre to prepare in collaboration with the authorities of Mozambique conservation projects with cost estimates in order to submit them to potential donors. \n &nbsp;
