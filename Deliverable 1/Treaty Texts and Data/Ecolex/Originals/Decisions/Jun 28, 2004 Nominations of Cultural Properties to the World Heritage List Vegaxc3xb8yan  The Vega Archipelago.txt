The World Heritage Committee,   1.  Inscribes  Vega\xc3\xb8yan - The Vega Archipelago, Norway, on the World Heritage List as a cultural landscape on the basis of cultural criterion (v):    Criterion (v) : The Vega Archipelago reflects the way generations of fishermen/farmers have, over the past 1500 years, maintained a sustainable living in an inhospitable seascape near the Arctic Circle, based on the now unique practice of eider down harvesting, and it also celebrates the contribution made by women to the eider down process;   2.  Requests  the authorities to develop a specific strategic plan for the World Heritage property that will contribute to the overall Master Plan for the archipelago.

Recommends  that the authorities undertake an inventory of the eider duck nesting houses on the islands and develop a conservation plan to ensure the protection of these unique structures;   4.  Encourages  the authorities to formalise the collection of traditional, intangible knowledge of the islands\xe2\x80\x99 cultural processes and traditions, in order to monitor their survival;   5.  Further encourages  the State Party to explore ways to minimize the visual impact on the landscape of the large radio mast on Vega Island;   6.
