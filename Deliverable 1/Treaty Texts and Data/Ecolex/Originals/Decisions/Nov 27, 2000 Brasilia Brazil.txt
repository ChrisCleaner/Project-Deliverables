VIII.35 Brasilia (Brazil)  \n Concerning the state of conservation report to be noted by the Committee, the Observer of Brazil stated that strict building regulations are being applied to all construction activities in Brasilia. Although the city is facing challenges due to the increase in population (3 million for a city originally designed for 500,000 inhabitants), which has led to some tension in the outskirts, the core of the city which forms the World Heritage site is intact and the World Heritage value is not adversely affected in any way by new developments. The Observer pointed out that the recommendation as adopted at the twenty-fourth extraordinary session of the Bureau, did not reflect the situation on the site. \n &nbsp;
