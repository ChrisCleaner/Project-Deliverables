The Committee, at its seventeenth session, expressed deep concern over the state of conservation of the Kathmandu Valley site and considered the possibility of placing it on the List of World Heritage in Danger, following discussions on the findings of the 1993 Joint UNESCO-ICOMOS Review Mission. \n At its twenty-first session, the Committee examined the state of conservation report of this site, and in view of the continued deterioration of the World Heritage values in the Bauddhanath and Kathmandu Monument Zones, affecting the site&rsquo;s integrity and inherent characteristics, the Committee requested the Secretariat, in collaboration with ICOMOS and His Majesty&rsquo;s Government (HMG) of Nepal, to study the possibility of deleting selected areas within some Monument Zones, without jeopardizing the universal significance and value of the site as a whole.&nbsp; This review was to take into consideration the intention of HMG of Nepal to nominate Kokhana as an additional Monument Zone. \n The Committee authorized a Joint UNESCO-ICOMOS-HMG of Nepal team to conduct a thorough study and to elaborate a programme for corrective measures in accordance with paragraphs 82-89 of the  Operational Guidelines .&nbsp; Based upon the information of this study and recommendations of the Bureau, the Committee, at its twenty-first session, decided that it could consider whether or not to inscribe this site on the List of World Heritage in Danger at its twenty-second session.&nbsp; Following this decision, a Joint UNESCO-ICOMOS-HMG of Nepal Mission was organized in March-April 1998. \n The Committee examined the findings and results of the Joint UNESCO-ICOMOS-HMG of Nepal Mission, and the 55 recommendations and Time-Bound Action Plan adopted by HMG of Nepal. The Committee commended HMG of Nepal for its efforts in strengthening the management of the Kathmandu Valley site with the creation of the  Heritage Conservation Unit . The Committee took note of the special efforts made by the local authorities to raise awareness amongst the private home owners to prevent further illegal demolition and inappropriate new constructions. \n The Committee decided to defer consideration of the inscription of the Kathmandu Valley site on the List of World Heritage in Danger until its twenty-third session. However, the Committee requested HMG of Nepal to continue implementing the 55 recommendations of the Joint Mission, to respect the deadlines of the Time-Bound Action Plan adopted by HMG of Nepal and in addition, recommended that HMG of Nepal adopts the three additional ICOMOS recommendations annexed to the 55 recommendations. HMG of Nepal was requested to submit a progress report before 15 April 1999 for examination by the twenty-third session of the Bureau in June 1999. \n The Committee at the time also requested HMG of Nepal to take measures to ensure that adequate protection and management are put into place at Kokhana, prior to its nomination as an additional Monument Zone to the Kathmandu Valley site. \n The Bureau examined the reports of the Secretariat and HMG of Nepal in implementing the 55 recommendations of the Joint UNESCO-ICOMOS-HMG of Nepal Mission, presented in WHC-99/CONF.204/INF.6 and WHC-99/CONF.204/INF.19. ICOMOS congratulated HMG of Nepal for its efforts to implement the Time-Bound Action Plan, and stated that the effectiveness of the Heritage Conservation Unit would be crucial for adequately safeguarding the seven Monument Zones composing the site. The Observer of Nepal reassured the Bureau that HMG of Nepal was doing its utmost to safeguard the Kathmandu Valley site, to respect the deadlines for the implementation of the Time-Bound Action Plan of Corrective Measures, and that this was a priority of the recently elected Prime Minister. He stated that the Ancient Monument Preservation Rules have been amended and would be approved shortly, and assured that the Heritage Conservation Unit would soon become fully active in regular monitoring and controlling development. \n The Bureau requested HMG of Nepal to continue implementing the 55 recommendations of the Joint Mission and urges HMG of Nepal to respect the deadlines for the implementation of the Time-Bound Action Plan of Corrective Measures, especially in relation to the establishment of the essential Ancient Monuments Preservation Rules which should increase the capacity of the relevant authorities in implementing the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act and in establishing a Monuments Conservation Fund for safeguarding the Kathmandu Valley site. \n The Bureau requested HMG of Nepal to report on the progress made in enforcing existing building regulations at Bauddhanath Monument Zone, and on the technical and financial plan for correcting the illegal buildings immediately surrounding the stupa, following the detailed recommendations of ICOMOS during the Joint Mission, before 15 September 1999.&nbsp; \n Finally, the Bureau requested HMG of Nepal to submit a report on the further progress made in implementing the 55 recommendations before 15 September 1999 for examination by the twenty-third extraordinary session of the Bureau in November 1999.
