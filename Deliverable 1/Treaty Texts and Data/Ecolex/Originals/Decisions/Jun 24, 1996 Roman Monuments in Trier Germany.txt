The Bureau took note of the report on the joint UNESCO - ICOMOS mission to examine the impact of housing construction that might have an impact on the Roman Amphitheater in Trier. It requested the German authorities to re-consider the construction of buildings that would be visible from the Amphitheater and to involve ICOMOS in the drawing up of the terms of reference for an architectural competition for the area immediately north of the theater. The Bureau requested that a full report of the mission as well as on the progress made in undertaking the architectural competition be presented to its next session in November 1996.
