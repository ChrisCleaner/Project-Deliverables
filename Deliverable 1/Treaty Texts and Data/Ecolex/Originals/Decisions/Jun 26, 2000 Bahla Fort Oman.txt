Following the presentation of the state of conservation of the site and reports on the regular missions of specialists from CRATerre and the World Heritage Centre, a discussion took place concerning the techniques used for the restoration of the Fort.&nbsp; The Delegates of Greece and Finland questioned whether it was a reconstruction of the site rather than a restoration.&nbsp; After discussions that mainly related to the restoration of the earthen buildings, it was suggested that an international seminar, with the participation of ICCROM and ICOMOS, be convened in Oman on earth construction and restoration.&nbsp; This would provide an opportunity to learn about the efforts being made by the Sultanate of Oman for its heritage and provide an exchange of experiences.&nbsp; The Representative of ICCROM welcomed the idea of a seminar and suggested that his Organization participate with a view to initiating a training strategy.&nbsp; This proposal was accepted by the Observer of the Sultanate of Oman.&nbsp; \n The Bureau commended the Omani authorities for the work undertaken and encouraged them to elaborate a management plan of the Fort and the Bahla Oasis and to provide it to the World Heritage Centre for submission to the Bureau at its twenty-fifth session.&nbsp; The Bureau thanked the Omani authorities for having accepted to host an international seminar on the earthen constructions in 2001.&nbsp; The Bureau expressed its wish that at its next session it could recommend to the Committee the removal of this site from the List of World Heritage in Danger.
