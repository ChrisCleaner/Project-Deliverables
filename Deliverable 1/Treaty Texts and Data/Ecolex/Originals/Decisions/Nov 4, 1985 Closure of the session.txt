19. Before declaring the meeting closed, the Chairman referred to the low level of resources in the World Heritage Fund which was, in his opinion, due to the facts that certain of the largest contributors to the Regular Budget of Unesco were not parties to the Convention and that certain of those States paying voluntary contributions had not paid the full amount which they had the moral obligation to pay. He expressed the hope that full and regular contributions would be made to the Fund so that the World Heritage Committee could fulfil its responsibilities under the  Convention . The Chairman announced that the ninth session of the World Heritage Committee would be held at Unesco Headquarters in Paris from 2 to 6 December 1985. He then declared closed the Fifth General Assembly of States Parties to the World Heritage Convention.
