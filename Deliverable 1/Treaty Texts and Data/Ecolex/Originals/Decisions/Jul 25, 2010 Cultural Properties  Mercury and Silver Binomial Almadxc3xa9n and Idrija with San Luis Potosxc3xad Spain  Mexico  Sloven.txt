The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Documents WHC-10/34.COM/8B and WHC-10/34.COM/INF.8B1.Add, \n 2.  Defers  the examination of the nomination of the  Mercury and Silver Binomial. Almad&eacute;n and Idrija with San Luis Potos&iacute;, Spain / Mexico / Slovenia , to the World Heritage List in order to enable the States Parties to: \n a) Reconsider the definition of the property in San Luis Potos&iacute;, but also with its mining region, and more broadly in comparison with the other silver extraction sites using the amalgamation process in Mexico, to bring it into line with the mining and industrial theme of the mercury and silver binomial, and so to establish its Outstanding Universal Value. An inventory of the technical and industrial heritage linked to the silver mines would be necessary for such a redefinition; \n 3.&nbsp; Considers  that any revised nomination requires an expert mission to the site; \n 4.&nbsp; Recommends  that the States Parties: \n a) Continue the contacts established with towns and silver mines which used the same mercury amalgamation process, particularly in Mexico and Bolivia, and with the Huancavelica mercury mine in Peru. However, the inclusion of additional sites which are not yet inscribed on the World Heritage List must give rise to a new nomination; \n b) Better integrate into the definition of the property the concepts of pollution and risks for human health resulting from the production and use of mercury. The international institute projected at Idrija for the study and the raising of public awareness of these issues is enthusiastically supported.
