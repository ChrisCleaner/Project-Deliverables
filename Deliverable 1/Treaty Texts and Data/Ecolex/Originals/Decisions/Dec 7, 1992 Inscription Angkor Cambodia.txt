Angkor  \n  667&nbsp;  \n  Cambodia  \n  C(i) (ii) (iii) (iv)  \n I. The Committee took note of the report presented by Mr. A. Beschaouch. Given the unique situation in Cambodia, which, in accordance with the Paris Accords, has been placed under the temporary administration of the United Nations since July 1991, the committee has decided to waive some conditions required under the Operational Guidelines and, on the basis of criteria (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), has inscribed the Angkor site, together with its monuments and its archeological zones as described in the "Perimetre de Protection" accompanying the ICOMOS report, on the World Heritage List. \n The Committee stressed that this action was not to be taken as setting a precedent for the inscription procedure. Therefore, in order to guarantee protection of the site for a three year period (1993 - 1995), the Committee has decided that a special in-depth study will be made of the Angkor site, and that reports will be presented to the Bureau and the Committee on the status of the monuments and the protective perimeter; the first report is to be presented at the June 1993 session of the Bureau to be followed by a report to the Committee during its seventeenth session in December 1993.&nbsp; \n II. In order to deal with the urgent problems of conservation quickly and effectively, the Committee has inscribed the site of Angkor on the List of World Heritage in Danger, and has requested, on the recommendation of ICOMOS, that the authorities concerned take the necessary steps to meet the following conditions: \n a) enact adequate protective legislation; b) establish an adequately staffed national protection agency; c) establish permanent boundaries based on the UNDP project; d) define meaningful buffer zones; e) establish monitoring and coordination of the internationalv conservation effort. \n The United States Delegate requested that his statement be incorporated as an annex to this report. \n &nbsp;
