The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/23:      To note that Fiji has reported annual data for the controlled substances in Annex E (methyl bromide) for 2003 that is above its requirement for that substance. As a consequence, for 2003, Fiji was in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2H of the Montreal Protocol;   To request Fiji, as a matter of urgency, to submit a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance. Fiji may wish to consider including in its plan of action the establishment of import quotas to freeze imports at baseline levels and support the phase-out schedule, and policy and regulatory instruments that will ensure progress in achieving the phase-out;   To monitor closely the progress of Fiji with regard to the phase-out of methyl bromide. To the degree that Fiji is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Fiji should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet its commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Meeting of the Parties cautions Fiji, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner, the Meeting of the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of methyl bromide (that is, the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
