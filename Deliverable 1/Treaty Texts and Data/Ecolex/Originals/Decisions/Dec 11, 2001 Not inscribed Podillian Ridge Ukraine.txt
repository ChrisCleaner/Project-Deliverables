Property:  Podillian Ridge  \n Id. N&deg;:  1051   \n State Party:  Ukraine    \n The Committee did not inscribe the property on the World Heritage List. \n Following the review of the five nominations from Ukraine, the Committee noted that potential sites for nomination could be identified by means of a World Heritage expert workshop, organised by the World Heritage Centre and the Ukrainian authorities. Such a workshop could develop an understanding of World Heritage requirements, help in the selection of appropriate sites and set the required standards for their management. Ideally, the workshop would involve natural heritage specialists from neighbouring countries as well as Ukrainian specialists. Cultural interests should also be involved, because several sites reviewed by IUCN have important cultural components. \n &nbsp;
