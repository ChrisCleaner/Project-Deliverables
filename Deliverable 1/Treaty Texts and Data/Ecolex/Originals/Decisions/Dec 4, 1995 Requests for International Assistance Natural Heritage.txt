A.1.1 Technical cooperation   \n  Komodo   National Park (Indonesia)  (US$ 64,500 requested)  The Committee reviewed the request for the purchase of a fibreglass catamaran boat and additional accessories for the GIS system for a total of US$ 64,500. However, in the light of the amount of funds already provided for the purchase of boats for the site, the Committee approved this project for a reduced amount of  US$ 30,000,  under the condition that the Indonesian authorities find an additional US$ 30,000 from other sources for its purchase. It furthermore suggested that the boat be insured by the Indonesian authorities as a matter of general policy. \n  Lake Malawi   National Park (Malawi)  (US$ 30,000 requested) The Committee approved  US$ 30,000  for a technical assistance project for the site. The project includes a comprehensive biological inventory of the Park, which contributes to the preparation of a new management plan, local awareness programmes and community projects, boat purchase and refurbishment, and an alternative income-generating study for the local population. \n  A.1.2 Training   \n  College of African Wildlife Management, Mweka (Tanzania)  (US$ 30,000 requested) The Committee approved an amount of  US$ 30,000  for three students to attend the one-year course (1996/97) at the College of African wildlife Management, Mweka, Tanzania, and requested the Centre to contact the Principal of the School to provide a detailed financial breakdown for each of the students. \n &nbsp;
