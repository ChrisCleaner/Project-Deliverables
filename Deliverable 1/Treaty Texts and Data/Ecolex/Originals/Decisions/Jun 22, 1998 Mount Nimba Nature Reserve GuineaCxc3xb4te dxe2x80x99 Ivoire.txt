The Bureau recalled that the Committee, at its last session, had requested the State Party (Guinea) and the Centre to contact the relevant mining companies, which foresee exploiting an iron-ore mine in the vicinity of the Reserve, to learn more details of their interest and willingness to set up an international foundation for the conservation of Mt. Nimba. The Bureau was informed that the Secretariat was intending to participate at a meeting, on 25 June 1998, jointly organised by the &ldquo;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique&rdquo; (CNRS) and a certain number of French Foundations on the subject of the &ldquo;Role of Foundations and Trusts in the Management of Cultural and Natural Heritage&rdquo;. Furthermore, the Bureau noted that the Centre is implementing a project using the US$ 20,000 approved by the Chairperson in 1997 to equip the Reserve\'s hydrological laboratory. \n The Bureau requested the Secretariat to report to the twenty-second session of the Committee on the outcome of its participation at the meeting organised by the CNRS and French Foundations and on the feasibility of establishing a foundation for Mt. Nimba. It recommended that the Committee retain Mt. Nimba in the List of World Heritage in Danger.
