This site which was inscribed in 1986 is threatened by the path of the A303 motorway through the southern part of the site. At the request of the Observer of the United Kingdom, a communication prepared by the concerned authorities was brought to the attention of the Bureau. Two proposals for the organization of the site will be discussed on 8 July 1994 at a meeting organized by The English Heritage and the National Trust, in which the representatives of the Ministry of Transportation and international experts will participate. The first foresees the construction of a tunnel which would be dug under the site. The second foresees the creation of an access bridge for visitors at the eastern end of the site which would be linked to an observation station on the top of the hill dominating Stonehenge. The first option is by far the most costly. \n The Bureau took note of this information and expressed the wish that a satisfactory project could be undertaken as soon as possible.
