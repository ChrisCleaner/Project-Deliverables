VII.3 Manovo-Gounda-St.Floris National Park (Central African Republic (CAR))  \n The Committee, at its last session (Naples, 1997), was seriously concerned about the uncontrolled poaching by armed groups which had led to the death of four members of the Park staff, decimated more than 80% of the Park\'s wildlife populations and brought tourism to a halt. The Committee had welcomed the efforts of the Government of CAR to assign site management responsibilities to a private Foundation and had requested the Centre and IUCN to contact the State Party and the Foundation to prepare a detailed state of conservation report and a rehabilitation plan for the site. The Committee noted that the State Party had not responded to the Centre\'s letter outlining the Committee\'s recommendations mentioned above. \n The Committee decided to retain this site in the List of World Heritage in Danger and requested the Director-General of UNESCO and the Chairperson of the World Heritage Committee to write to the President of the CAR inviting his urgent intervention for the preparation of a detailed state of conservation report and a rehabilitation plan for the conservation of this site. \n &nbsp;
