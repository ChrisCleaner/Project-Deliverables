The Bureau was informed that this Park is located in a very remote area, and due to difficulty of access, remains well protected. There are no major threats to the Park; a certain amount of illegal collection of medicinal plants and herbs has been recorded. No visitors are allowed to the Park; some mountaineering groups have in recent times expressed an interest in organizing expeditions to the area. Allowing a certain amount of visitation may facilitate the presentation of this World Heritage Area to the general public and may generate income for the benefit of local people as well. Hence, the Bureau, while taking note of the high level of protection afforded to Nanda Devi National Park, invited Indian authorities to consider undertaking a feasibility study for specialized (mountaineering) tourism development in the Park.
