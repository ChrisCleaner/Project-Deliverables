15. The Bureau  reviewed  another request from Tanzania, for the purchase of equipment for protecting the archaeological and palaeontological site of Olduvai Gorge in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area of the United Republic of Tanzania. \n The Bureau, however,  deferred its recommendations  on this request, since the site had been inscribed on the World Heritage List under natural criteria. The Bureau, though,  suggested  that ICOMOS and the Secretariat provide further information on the relevance of cultural values for the inscription of this site on the World Heritage List at the forthcoming meeting of the Bureau and, subsequently, at the session of the Committee. \n The Bureau  also considered  the desiderability of revising the criteria under which certain properties have previously been included, in order to determine whether other cultural or natural criteria did not also apply. \n &nbsp;
