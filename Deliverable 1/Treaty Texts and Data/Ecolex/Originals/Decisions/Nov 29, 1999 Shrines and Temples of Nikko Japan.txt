Property:  Shrines and Temples of Nikko  \n Id. N&deg;:  913  \n State Party:  Japan    \n Criteria:  C (i) (iv) (vi)  \n The Committee inscribed this property on the World Heritage List on the basis of  criteria (i), (iv)  and  (vi) : \n   Criterion (i):   The Nikko shrines and temples are a reflection of architectural and artistic genius; this aspect is reinforced by the harmonious integration of the buildings in a forest and a natural site laid out by people. \n   Criterion (iv):   Nikko is a perfect illustration of the architectural style of the Edo period as applied to Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. The Gongen-zukuri style of the two mausoleums, the T&ocirc;sh&ocirc;g&ucirc; and the Taiy&ucirc;-in Reiby&ocirc;, reached the peak of its expression in Nikko, and was later to exert a decisive influence. The ingenuity and creativity of its architects and decorators are revealed in an outstanding and distinguished manner. \n   Criterion (vi):   The Nikko shrines and temples, together with their environment, are an outstanding example of a traditional Japanese religious centre, associated with the Shinto perception of the relationship of man with nature, in which mountains and forests have a sacred meaning and are objects of veneration, in a religious practice that is still very much alive today. \n The Committee took note of the comments of ICOMOS that the development pressure near the south-west border of the site would require the State Party to be vigilant in monitoring potential threats in the future.
