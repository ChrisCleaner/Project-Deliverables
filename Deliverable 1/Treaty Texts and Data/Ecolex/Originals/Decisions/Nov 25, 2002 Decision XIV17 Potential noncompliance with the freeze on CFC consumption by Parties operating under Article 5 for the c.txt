The  Fourteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XIV/17:      To note that, pursuant to decision X/29 of the Tenth Meeting of the Parties, the Implementation Committee requested the Secretariat to write to those Parties operating under Article 5 that had reported data on CFC consumption for either the year 2000 and/or 2001 that was above their individual baselines;   To note that Guatemala, Malta, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea have failed to report data for the control period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, and have reported annual data for either 2000 or 2001 which is above their baseline. In the absence of further clarification, these Parties are presumed to be in non-compliance with the control measures under the Protocol;   To urge these Parties to report data for the control period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 as a matter of urgency;   To closely monitor the progress of these Parties with regard to the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. To the degree that these Parties are working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, they should continue to be treated in the same manner as Parties in good standing. In this regard, these Parties should continue to receive international assistance to enable them to meet their commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that might be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. However, through this decision, the Parties caution these Parties, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that any Party fails to return to compliance in a timely manner, the Parties shall consider measures, consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. These measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of CFCs (that is the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
