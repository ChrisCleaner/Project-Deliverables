The  Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVII/31:      To note that Ecuador ratified the Montreal Protocol on 10 April 1990 and the London Amendment on 30 April 1990, is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol in February 1992. The Executive Committee has approved $5,493,045 from the Multilateral Fund to enable the Party\xe2\x80\x99s compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;   To note also that Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for the controlled substance in Annex B, group III (methyl chloroform), is 1.997 ODP-tonnes. As the Party reported consumption of 3.484 ODP-tonnes of methyl chloroform in 2003, it was in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2E of the Montreal Protocol;   To note with appreciation Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s submission of a plan of action to ensure a prompt return to compliance with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s methyl chloroform control measures and to note that, under the plan, without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Protocol, Ecuador specifically commits itself:     To reduce methyl chloroform consumption from 2.50 ODP-tonnes in 2004 to 1.3979 ODP-tonnes in 2005;   To monitor its existing system for licensing imports and exports of ozone-depleting substances, which includes import quotas;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 3 above should enable Ecuador to return to compliance in 2005 and to urge Ecuador to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action to phase out consumption of the controlled substance in Annex B, group III (methyl chloroform);   To monitor closely the progress of Ecuador with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of methyl chloroform. To the degree that the Party is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Ecuador should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Ecuador, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that it fails to remain in compliance, the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of methyl chloroform that is, the substance that is the subject of non-compliance is ceased so that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
