The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Documents  WHC-09/33.COM/8B, WHC-09/33.COM/INF.8B1, WHC-09/33.COM/INF.8B1add  and  WHC-09/33.COM/INF.8B2  and having reflected upon its discussions on the inscriptions of properties to the World Heritage List; \n 2.  Recognizes  the reluctance of the World Heritage Committee to endorse the recommendations of the Advisory Bodies regarding deferral of the examination of properties and requests the Advisory Bodies to prepare a background document on the processes, benchmarks and time constraints resulting from World Heritage Decisions on referral and deferral for information to the 34th session of the World Heritage Committee (2010); \n 3.  Notes  that questions addressed to the State Party presenting a nomination which concern the justification of Outstanding Universal Value, application and validity of inscription criteria, and the preferred outcome, may invite advocacy and should in general be avoided; \n 4.  Requests  that in evaluating minor modifications and retrospective statements of Outstanding Universal Value, the Advisory Bodies review their recommendations with the State Party within a reasonable timeframe and prior to their submission to the World Heritage Committee for adoption.
