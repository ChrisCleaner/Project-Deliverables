The World Heritage Committee, \n \n  Having examined  Documents WHC-12/36.COM/8B.Add and WHC-12/36.COM/INF.8B1.Add, \n  Refers  the examination of the proposed buffer zone for the  Old Town of Segovia and its Aqueduct, Spain , back to the State Party in order to allow it to: \n \n a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide a textual description and justification of the buffer zone boundary. This should consider views to and from the property and include an appropriate analysis, \n b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide detailed information regarding the protection afforded the buffer zone by the Special Plans for the Historical Areas of Segovia (PEAHIS), and on how the loop of aqueduct and buffer zone outside the Special Plan area (Plano UNESCO 8) will be protected.
