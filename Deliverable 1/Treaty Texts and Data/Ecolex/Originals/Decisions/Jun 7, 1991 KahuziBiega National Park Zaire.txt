Since the last session of the Committee, IUCN has conducted an impact study and recommended that the proposed new road not go through the park but be re-routed around the northern boundaries of the park. The Bureau noted that the study is now being reviewed by the donor financing the road-construction project (KFW and the GTZ of Germany) and that the project also has several implications for the ecology of the region. The Bureau requested IUCN and the Secretariat to follow the progress and submit a report at the next session of the Committee.
