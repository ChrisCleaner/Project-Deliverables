The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-09/33.COM/7B.Add , \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  23 COM B.1 , adopted at its 23rd session, \n 3.  Notes  the information provided by the State Party on the state of conservation of the property, but r egrets  that the State Party did not follow the procedure outlined in Paragraph 172 of the  Operational Guidelines  to inform the World Heritage Centre of all planned activities within and in the vicinity of the property which could impact its Outstanding Universal Value, before taking a decision on these projects; \n 4.  Also notes  that there seems to be a lack of understanding at the local level on the nature of this mixed World Heritage property, its boundaries and the requirements to maintain the values and conditions of integrity that justified the inscription of the property in the World Heritage List; \n 5.  Expresses its concern  on the conflicting information received in relation to the actual conservation status of this property and on the potential impacts on the property from the project to expand the facilities of the existing port, and therefore  requests  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre/IUCN/ICOMOS reactive monitoring mission to the property; \n 6.  Also requests  the State Party to provide details on the Environmental Impact Assessment to the World Heritage Centre, IUCN and ICOMOS, and not to start the construction of the proposed expansion of the port\'s facility until the reactive monitoring mission to the property has been carried out in order to address any recommendations arising from this mission; \n 7.  Further requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2010 , a detailed report on the state of conservation of the property, including information on how to address key recommendations arising from the proposed monitoring mission, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010.
