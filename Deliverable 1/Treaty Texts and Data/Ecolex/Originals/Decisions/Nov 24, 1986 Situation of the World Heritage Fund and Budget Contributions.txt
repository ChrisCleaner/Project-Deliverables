39. The Committee noted that the Executive Board of Unesco, at its 126th session in September 1986, had taken up the question of the withdrawal of the declaration on voluntary contributions. The Executive Board had been of the opinion, however, that it was not the type of contribution which was important but rather the fact that all States Parties should pay in full the one per cent of their contribution to the regular budget of Unesco. The Committee noted with satisfaction the text of decision 5.4.3 adopted by the Executive Board, and especially paragraphs 11 and 12 which read as follows: \n "The Executive Board, \n 11.  Appeals  to Member States, which have not become parties to the World Heritage Conven&shy;tion, to examine the possibility of becoming parties thereto, and \n 12.  Appeals  to all States Parties, whether or not they have made the declaration foreseen in Article 16, paragraph 2, to pay promptly and regularly to the World Heritage Fund at least one per cent of their contribution to the regular budget of Unesco, in order to increase the resources which are needed to ensure the safeguarding of World Heritage sites." \n 40. The Committee paid tribute to Mr. Gough Whitlam (Australia) and Mr. Ian Christie Clark (Canada) for their personal commitment, in their capacity as Members of the Executive Board, to furthering the objectives of the Convention and noted that their efforts had increased the aware&shy;ness of all Member States of the existence of the World Heritage Convention and had encouraged the prompt payment of contributions. \n &nbsp;
