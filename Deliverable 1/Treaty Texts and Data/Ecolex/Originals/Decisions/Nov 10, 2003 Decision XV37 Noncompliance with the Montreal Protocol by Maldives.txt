The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/37:      To note that, in accordance with decision XIV/26 of the Fourteenth Meeting of the Parties, Maldives was requested to submit to the Implementation Committee a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance;   To note with appreciation Maldives\xe2\x80\x99 submission of its plan of action, and to note also that, under the plan, Maldives specifically commits itself:     To reducing CFC consumption from 2.8 ODP-tonnes in 2002 as follows:     To 0 ODP-tonnes in 2003, 2004 and 2005;   To 2.3 ODP-tonnes in 2006;   To 0.69 ODP-tonnes in 2007;   To 0 ODP-tonnes in 2008 and 2009;   To phasing out CFC consumption by 1 January 2010, as required under the Montreal Protocol, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To monitoring its existing system for licensing imports of ODS, including quotas, introduced in 2002;   To banning, by 2004, imports of ODS-using equipment;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 2 above have already enabled Maldives to return to compliance, to congratulate Maldives on that progress and to urge Maldives to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the remainder of the plan of action and phase out consumption of ozone-depleting substances in Annex A, group I;   To monitor closely the progress of Maldives with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of CFCs. To the degree that Maldives is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Maldives should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Maldives, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that it fails to remain in compliance the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of CFCs (that is, the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
