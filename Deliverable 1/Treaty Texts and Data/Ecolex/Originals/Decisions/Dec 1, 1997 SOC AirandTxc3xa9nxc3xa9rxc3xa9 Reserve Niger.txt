VII.20 Air-and-T&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; Reserve (Niger)   \n The Committee recalled that the Delegate of Niger, at the twenty-first session of the Bureau, was of the view that the state of conservation of the site had considerably improved and the site may be removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger and that a monitoring mission to the site was foreseen for autumn 1997. The Centre informed the Committee that this mission did not take place due to time constraints. IUCN informed the Committee that a number of activities are underway to resume the IUCN/Danish/Swiss Cooperation project at this site. \n In the absence of further information, the Committee decided to retain Air-and-T&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; Reserve in the List of World Heritage in Danger.
