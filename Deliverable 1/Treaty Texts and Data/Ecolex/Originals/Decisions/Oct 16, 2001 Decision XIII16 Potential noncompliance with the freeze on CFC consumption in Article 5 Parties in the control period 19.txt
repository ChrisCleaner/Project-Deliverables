The  Thirteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XIII/16:      To note that, in accordance with decision X/29 of the 10th Meeting of the Parties, the Implementation Committee requested the Secretariat to write to the following Article 5 Parties, Bangladesh, Chad, Comoros, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Kenya, Mongolia, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Samoa and Solomon Islands, that had reported data on CFC consumption for either the year 1999 and/or 2000 that was above their individual baselines;   That since none of the above Parties has responded to the request from the Secretariat for data for the control period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, all are presumed to be in non-compliance with the control measures under the Protocol in the absence of further clarification;   To closely monitor the progress of these Parties with regard to the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. To the degree that these Parties are working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, they should continue to be treated in the same manner as Parties in good standing. In this regard, these Parties should continue to receive international assistance to enable them to meet these commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that might be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. However, through this decision, the Parties caution these Parties, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that any country fails to return to compliance in a timely manner, the Parties shall consider measures, consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. These measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of CFCs (that is the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that importing Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
