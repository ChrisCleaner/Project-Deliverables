IX.23  Following the examination of the state of conservation reports, the Committee adopted the following proposals for the monitoring and reporting on the state of conservation of individual World Heritage properties in 1995 and invited the Secretariat to ensure their implementation: \n \n The highest priority will be given to the monitoring of and reporting on sites on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n The Secretariat will again report to the Bureau at its nineteenth session in 1995 on the state of conservation of all sites on the List of World Heritage in Danger with an assessment of the appropriateness of their continued inclusion in this List. \n The Secretariat, in collaboration with the advisory bodies, will continue to undertake reactive monitoring whenever deemed necessary. \n \n &nbsp;
