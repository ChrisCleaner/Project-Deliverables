The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-08/32.COM/7B , \n 2.  Recalling  its Decision  31 COM 7B.73 , adopted at its 31st session (Christchurch, 2007), \n 3.  Reiterating its concern  that the level of co-ordination and the priority given to protection of the property\'s Outstanding Universal Value has been insufficient to halt the progressive loss of its fabric and traditions in the face of development pressures, \n 4.  Recognizing  the commitment of the State Party to improve the state of conservation of the property, including through recent measures to launch the revision of the Urban Plan, reinforce the Maison du Patrimoine and strengthen coordination with local stakeholders at the site, \n 5.  Urges  the State Party to implement all the recommendations made by the November 2007 mission and especially: \n a) to revise the Urban Plan for the province  of Luang Prabang and define, in this context, a buffer zone for the property; \n b) to impose a moratorium, pending the approval of the revised Urban Plan, on major development projects such as the proposed new town in the Chompeth Valley, the airport extension and realignment, the conversion of the primary school and Fine Arts College for tourism, and the pedestrian / motorcycle bridge across the Nam Khan; \n c) to ensure the strict application of the Luang Prabang conservation plan (PSMV) and prepare an updated inventory and maps of the property, indicating the changes as regards listed buildings, existing and new constructions, wetlands, etc.; \n 6.  Reiterates its requests  to the State Party to develop, in consultation with the World Heritage Centre and the Advisory Bodies, a draft Statement of Outstanding Universal Value, including the conditions of integrity and authenticity, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 33rd session in 2009; \n 7.  Invites  the State Party to provide information on press reports of an alleged planned Mekong mainstream dam at Luang Prabang, to be developed for opening in 2014, and its potential impact on the property; \n 8.  Requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2009 , a report on the state of conservation of the property and on the steps taken to implement the above recommendations, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 33rd session in 2009,  with a view to considering, in the absence of substantial progress, the inscription of the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
