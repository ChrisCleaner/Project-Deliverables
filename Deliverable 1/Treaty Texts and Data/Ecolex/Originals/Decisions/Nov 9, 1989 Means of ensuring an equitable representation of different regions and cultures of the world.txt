12. Examination of item 7 of the agenda concerning the examination of the means of ensuring an equitable representation of different regions and cultures of the world gave rise to an intensive debate. At the opening of the debate, the Delegate of Sri Lanka, whose mandate on the Committee was about to be completed, explained that his country had withdrawn from standing for re-election for a further term in order to respond to the need of ensuring a rotation of members on the Committee. Most speakers were of the opinion that, a better rotation of members on the Committee was a necessary precondition to improving geographical and cultural representation on the Committee. Numerous speakers were of the opinion that, in addition to the rotation, the World Heritage Committee should consider estab\xc2\xadlishing new procedures for the next elections, such as determ\xc2\xadining quotas of seats per region. Since the number of States Parties is increasing, it becomes necessary to apply election mechanisms in order to ensure effective representation of regions and cultures, as mentioned in Article 8, paragraph 2, of the  Convention . A few speakers, while recognizing the difficulties inherent in a procedure for revising the Convention, nonetheless considered that in the long term it might be necessary to resort to a revision of the  Convention  in order to increase the number of Committee members to thirty-six, currently fixed by Article 8, paragraph 1, of the Convention. The intermediate solution proposed by the Bureau of the Committee aiming to institute a: new category of observers which would have enabled outgoing members of the Committee to be formally, as well as closely, associated in its work for a period of four years, it being understood that they would not be able to stand for re-election before six years, was not accepted. At the conclusion of the debate on this item, the Assembly consequently adopted following Resolution:    "The General Assembly of States Parties to the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage,      Recalling  Article 8, paragraph 2, of the  Convention  which stipulates that \'Election of members of the Committee shall ensure an equitable representation of the different regions and cultures of the world\';      Considering  that for this purpose it is important to observe the practice of rotation in the representation of States Parties on the Committee;      Invites  the States Parties to the World Heritage Convention, whose mandates on the Committee expire, to consider not to stand for re-election during an appropriate period;      Requests  the Chairman, at each election, to invite States Parties to take account of this Resolution;      Invites  the President of the World Heritage Committee to do everything in his power to encourage the States Parties, whose mandates on the Committee have just expired, to remain closely associated with its work for a period of four years, in conformity with Article 8.1 of the Committee\'s Rules of Procedure;      Invites  the World Heritage Committee to give further consideration at its meetings in the next two years to additional procedures, such as regional quotas, to ensure an equitable representation of the different regions and cultures of the world, as required by Article 8, paragraph 2, of the  Convention ;      Invites  furthermore the World Heritage Committee to formulate proposals in view of financing, in whole or in part, travel and sojourn expenses for the members of the Committee representing the least developed countries."
