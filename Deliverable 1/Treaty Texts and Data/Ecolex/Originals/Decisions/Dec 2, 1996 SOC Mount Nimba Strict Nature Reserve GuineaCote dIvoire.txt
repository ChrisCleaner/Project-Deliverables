VII.17 Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve (Guinea/Cote   d\'Ivoire  )  \n The site was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1992 because of negative impacts from a proposed iron-ore mining project and threats due to the arrival of a large number of refugees from neighbouring countries. \n The Ministry for Energy and Environment, in collaboration with the "Mission Francaise de Cooperation et d\'Action Culturelle", organized a Round Table on Mount Nimba which was held in Conakry (Guinea) on 17 and 18 April 1996 with participation from the Secretariat. The Round Table included representatives of the following donor countries and organizations: France, Germany, Japan, Canada, the Wallonian Region of Belgium, The World Bank, UNDP, the European Union, and USAID. The recommendations included that UNESCO consider the establishment of a working group to create an "International Foundation for Mount Nimba". Preliminary discussions of a reflection group began, including legal aspects of such a foundation, which are to be considered by the Legal Advisor of UNESCO. \n The Committee discussed the threats to the site (mining proposal, refugees, lack of management) as well as the question of training of staff. \n The Committee commended the states Parties for their efforts. However, given the uncertainties concerning the adequate management of the site, and the shortcomings with regard to the on-site management, the Committee decided to retain the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
