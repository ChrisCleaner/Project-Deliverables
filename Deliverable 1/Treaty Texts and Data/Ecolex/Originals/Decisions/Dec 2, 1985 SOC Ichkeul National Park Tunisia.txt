Ichkeul National   Park  ,   Tunisia  :    The critical situation of this park, as reported to the Bureau at its 9th session had not altered and IUCN noted that if compensatory measures to re-establish the water regime of this Park were not taken very soon, the property would lose its international importance for migratory wildfowl. IUCN therefore strongly recommended the inclusion of this Park in the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Tunisian authorities had not responded to the Secretariat\'s request for further information, however, the representative of Tunisia informed the Committee that he would take up this matter at the highest level and he would inform the Secretariat and IUCN of the results of this enquiry. \n &nbsp;
