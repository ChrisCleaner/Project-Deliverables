Huanglong Scenic and Historic Interest Area&nbsp;  \n  638  \n  China, People\'s Republic of  \n  N(iii)  \n The Committee inscribed the central and second class conservation zones of Huanglong on the World Heritage List, excluding Mouni Gully sub-division in the west, since its condition and natural values need to be further investigated. The Committee recommended that the Chinese authorities prepare a species conservation status report in order to investigate the possibility that the site may also qualify for inscription under natural heritage criterion (iv). \n The Committee recognized that the Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic and Historic Interest Area and the Huanglong Scenic and Historic Interest Area belong to the same ecological unit, despite being under different county administrations. Taking into account the views expressed by members, the Committee proposed that the separate listing of Huanglong and Jiuzhaigou as World Heritage sites be regarded as Phase I of a two-phase process. The Committee recommended that the Chinese authorities initiate Phase II by investigating the land intervening between the Huanglong and Jiuzhaigou sites (including the previously nominated Wanglang Reserve) and consider submitting a revised nomination for inscription as a unified site in the Minshan Mountains. Such a revised nomination would incorporate the Huanglong and Jiuzhaigou sites and other land considered as meeting World Heritage criteria. The Committee also noted that many precedents exist, including transfrontier sites, where the inscription of a large site does not imply the necessity for a single administrative structure. \n The Delegate from China thanked the Committee for separate listing of the two sites and informed the members that the Chinese authorities would take into consideration the recommendations of the Committee. The reports on the recommendations will be submitted to the Committee in the future. \n &nbsp;
