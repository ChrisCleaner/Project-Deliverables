The Secretariat informed the Bureau that the Third International Experts Meeting on Borobudur was held on site in January 1995 and that the Expert Group expressed satisfaction on the state of conservation of Borobudur, which has been the object of a UNESCO International Safeguarding Campaign launched in 1972, although the site was only inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1991. The Centre reported that the meeting made, inter  alia,  the following recommendations: \n (i) avoid any future actions or activities that would unnecessarily disturb the traditional appearance of the site, e.g. construction of park features that have little relationship with the local landscape, indigenous plant species; functions which would devalue the dignity of the site; \n (ii) develop regulations to protect Zones III,IV and Voutside the Borobudur Park boundaries against inappropriate new construction, etc; \n (iii) develop mid-term (5 year) and long-term (10 year) strategic planning policies &lsquo;and programmes in consultation with appropriate national, regional and local authorities to identify and prioritize conservation measures; institution-building; quality and quantity of staffing level and their training needs; \n (iv) review of information management system; \n (v) develop tourism management policy to ensure protection of site and distribution of tourism revenue for conservation activities; \n (vi) develop information material including multi-media material; and \n (vii) further research and publication on stone conservation and biological growth concerns. \n The Bureau, having noted the outcome of the International Campaign Review Meeting, commended the Government of Indonesia, UNESCO and their partners for their conservation work over the past two decades and requested the World Heritage Centre to arrange with the Indonesian authorities, the most suitable modalities for the preparation of the periodic state of conservation report to be submitted to the World Heritage Committee in accordance with the agreed procedures.
