The election of the members of the World Heritage Committee shall be conducted on the basis of the composition of the electoral groups of UNESCO, as determined by the UNESCO General Conference at its most recent session, it being understood that \xe2\x80\x98Group V\xe2\x80\x99 shall consist of two separate groups, for the African States and Arab States respectively.    c)  Notwithstanding, at each election, one seat shall be reserved for States Parties with no property on the World Heritage List.

An additional seat shall be allocated for Group III and Group IV on a rotational basis.      d)   Notwithstanding, at each election, due consideration shall be given to the election of at least one State Party which has never served as a Member of the World Heritage Committee.       e) In case the above formula cannot be practically applied, an exceptional arrangement may be made to accommodate such special circumstances.     d)   f)  Ballot(s) for  reserved   allocated  seat(s) shall precede the ballot(s) for the remaining seats to be filled. Unsuccessful candidates in a ballot for any  reserved   allocated  seat shall be eligible to stand for election in subsequent ballot(s).   14.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before the election begins, the Chairperson shall appoint two tellers from among the delegates present; he/she shall hand to them the list of States entitled to vote and the list of States candidates.

If there still remain seat(s) to be filled, there shall be a second round.   In case two or more candidates obtain the same number of votes for the seat(s) remaining to be filled, a second round shall be held for those candidates to fill those remaining seat(s). b) Ballot for the open (non allocated) seats     The candidate(s) obtaining in the first round, more than half of the valid votes cast by States Parties present and voting shall be declared elected in the sequential order of the number of votes obtained from the highest to the lowest, up to the number of seat(s) to be filled. If there still remain seat(s) to be filled, there shall be a second round.    14.9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the second round, the candidate(s) obtaining the  greatest   highest  number of votes, up to the number of seat(s) to be filled, shall be declared elected.   14.10 If in the second round, two or more candidates obtain the same number of votes, and, as a result, the number of these candidates is greater than the remaining number of seats to be filled, there shall be an additional round of voting restricted to those candidates who obtained the same number of votes. If in this additional round of voting, two or more candidates obtain the same number of votes, the Chairperson shall decide by drawing lots among them in order to allocate the remaining seat(s).   14.11 After each round, the Chairperson shall announce the results.   \xc2\xa0 5.  Reiterates its strong request  to States Parties and electoral groups to provide a sufficient number of candidates for each seat and each election to ensure a genuine choice at each election; 6.  Also decides  that the rotational order for the attribution of the floating seat for Group III and Group IV shall be decided by the General Assembly of States Parties at its 20th ordinary session in 2015. 7.  Further decides  to introduce a standard candidature format for the presentation of experts (model to be developed by the Secretariat);  8.  Requests  the World Heritage Centre to develop a standard candidature format for the presentation of experts to be submitted to the General Assembly of States Parties at its 20th ordinary session in 2015.       [1]    Resolution  13 GA 9  (paragraph 6) invites the States Parties to the  World Heritage Convention , to voluntarily reduce their term of office from six to four years.        [2]       It being understood that \xe2\x80\x9cGroup V\xe2\x80\x9d shall consist of two separate groups for the African and Arab States.          [3]       That is to say, that either there is no State Party in the composition of the Committee from a given electoral group at the beginning of the ordinary session of the General Conference, or that the term of   office of all States   Parties from a given electoral group expires at the end of the ordinary session of the General Conference.
