XIII.13  The Committee considered the revision to paragraph 65 of the  Operational Guidelines  as recommended by the Bureau at its twenty-third session. The Committee recalled that discussions took place at the twenty-second session of the Committee and the twenty-third session of the Bureau on the proposal made by the Delegate of Italy, and that a working group chaired by Professor Francionni had reviewed the implications of paragraph 65 during the twenty-third session of the World Heritage Bureau, and indicated that the evaluations of nominations, prepared by the advisory bodies, be transmitted to the States Parties concerned at the same time as they are transmitted to the members of the Committee. \n  XIII.14  The Observer of France stated that the proposed revision might seem to add transparency but as a matter of fact it would give the advisory bodies a role of a decision-maker which does not belong to them but to the World Heritage Bureau and Committee. He noted, as did many delegates, and also the advisory bodies, that the revision could create confusion about the nomination and evaluation procedures. It was also observed that the  Operational Guidelines  had been revised frequently over the past years and that it would be advisable that this revision be considered in the context of the overall revision of the  Operational Guidelines . Two delegates reminded the Committee that the intention of the proposed revision was to enhance equity between the Committee members and those States Parties who are not members of the World Heritage Committee. \n  XIII.15  The Committee decided to defer the examination of the proposed revision. It requested that this matter be considered in the framework of the meeting on the  Operational Guidelines  that will take place in the United Kingdom in April 2000. \n &nbsp;
