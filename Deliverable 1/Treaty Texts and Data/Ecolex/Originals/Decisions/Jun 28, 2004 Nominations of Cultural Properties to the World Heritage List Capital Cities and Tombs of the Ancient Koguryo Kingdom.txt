The World Heritage Committee,   1.  Inscribes  the Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom, China, on the World Heritage List on the basis of cultural criteria (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v):    Criterion (i):  The tombs represent a masterpiece of the human creative genius in their wall paintings and structures.    Criterion (ii):  The Capital Cities of the Koguryo Kingdom are an early example of mountain cities, later imitated by neighbouring cultures. The tombs, particularly the important stele and a long inscription in one of the tombs, show the impact of Chinese culture on the Koguryo (who did not develop their own writing). The paintings in the tombs, while showing artistic skills and specific style, are also an example of strong impact from other cultures.    Criterion (iii) : The Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom represent exceptional testimony to the vanished Koguryo civilization.    Criterion (iv):  The system of capital cities represented by Guonei City and Wandu Mountain City also influenced the construction of later capitals built by the Koguryo regime; the Koguryo tombs provide outstanding examples of the evolution of piled-stone and earthen tomb construction.    Criterion (v):  The capital cities of the Koguryo Kingdom represent a perfect blending of human creation and nature \xe2\x80\x93 whether with the rocks or with forests and rivers.   2.
