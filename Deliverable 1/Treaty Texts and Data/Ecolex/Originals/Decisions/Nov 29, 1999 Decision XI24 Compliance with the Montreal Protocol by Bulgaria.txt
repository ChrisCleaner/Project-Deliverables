The  Eleventh Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XI/24:      To note that Bulgaria acceded to the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol on 20 November 1990 and acceded to the London and Copenhagen Amendments on 28 April 1999. The country is classified as a non-Article 5 Party under the Protocol and, for 1997, reported positive consumption of 1.6 ODP tonnes of Annex A Group II substances, none of which was for essential uses exempted by the Parties. As a consequence, in 1997 Bulgaria was in non-compliance with its control obligations under Articles 2A through 2E of the Montreal Protocol;   To note with appreciation the work done by Bulgaria in cooperation with the Global Environment Facility to develop a country programme and establish a phase-out plan that brought Bulgaria into compliance with the Montreal Protocol by 1 January 1998;   To monitor closely the progress of Bulgaria with regard to the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances, particularly towards meeting the specific commitments noted above and in this regard, to request that Bulgaria submit a complete copy of its country programme when approved, including the specific benchmarks, to the Implementation Committee, through the Ozone Secretariat, for its consideration at its next meeting. To the degree that Bulgaria is working towards and meeting the specific time-based commitments noted above and continues to report data annually demonstrating a decrease in imports and consumption, Bulgaria should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In this regard, Bulgaria should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet these commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that might be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through this decision, however, the Parties caution Bulgaria, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that the country fails to meet the commitments noted above in the times specified, the Parties shall consider measures, consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. These measures could include the possibility of actions that may be available under Article 4, designed to ensure that the supply of CFCs and halons that is the subject of non-compliance is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
