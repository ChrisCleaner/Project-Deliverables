The Bureau was again informed about the continuing illegal and random cultivation at the site, and noted that no official response had been received from the Tanzanian authorities, although the Cultural Commissioner of Tanzania indicated that a response would be sent to the Centre. The Bureau again expressed its concern and asked the Centre to send a letter to the authorities concerning the ongoing cultivation at site, and requesting them to cooperate with the IUCN mission scheduled for October 1994.
