The Bureau recalled the fact that the boat provided to this World Heritage area with financial assistance from the Fund in 1994, was destroyed in an accident during a systematic monitoring mission to the site in July 1995, in which four Indonesian officials lost their lives. With a view to equipping the Park with a boat capable of undertaking open-sea travel, the Committee at its nineteenth session (Berlin, 1995) approved a sum of US$ 30,000 and requested that the State Party provide the additional US$ 30,000 needed to purchase a large fiberglass catamaran. Learning the fact that the Ministry of Forestry of Indonesia has made available the US$ 30,000 as recommended by the Committee, the Bureau requested the Centre to transmit its appreciation of the Indonesian Government\'s contribution of US$ 30,000 to match an equal amount provided by the Committee. The Bureau also requested the management of the Komodo National Park to fully insure the boat against accidents and other potential liabilities.
