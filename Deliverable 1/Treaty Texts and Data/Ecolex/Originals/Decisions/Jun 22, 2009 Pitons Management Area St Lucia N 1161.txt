The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-09/33.COM/7B , \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  32 COM 7B.40 , adopted at its 32nd (Quebec City, 2008), \n 3.  Takes note  of the activities reported in the State Party\'s report on the state of conservation of the property but  also notes  that this does not address many of the key points of Decision  32 COM 7B.40 , nor include detailed baseline information on current land use within the property and a description of the development application and review process as previously requested by the World Heritage Committee; \n 4.  Expresses its serious concern  that the State Party has not complied with all the requests expressed by the World Heritage Committee in Decision  32 COM 7B.40 , and that: \n a) The Integrated Development Plan (IDP) for the property was approved without further reflection on the level of development foreseen, which may lead to a level of development that is incompatible with its Outstanding Universal Value, \n b) The moratorium on approval of developments within the property has been lifted without such an assessment of the IDP and without clear legal systems of planning advice being in place, \n c) A significant development has taken place that does not conform to the requirements of the IDP, and which is acknowledged to have damaged the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n 5.  Regrets  that a range of critical issues are in evidence that pose a threat to the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, and that a number of threats to its integrity exist in relation to the protection, planning and management of the property, and the apparent reconsideration of the boundaries of the property; \n 6.  Requests  the State Party to urgently re-establish and maintain a moratorium on development decisions within or affecting the property, to allow a reconsideration by the State Party of the level of development foreseen in the IDP and for effective systems for protection and management of the property to be put in place, and to complete the previously requested baseline assessment of land use in the property; \n 7.  Also requests  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre / IUCN reactive monitoring mission to the property to assess its current state of conservation and the effectiveness of its protection, planning and management, including from development within and outside its boundaries; \n 8.  Also requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2010 , a report on the state of conservation of the property and on the steps taken to respond to the concerns listed above, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010.
