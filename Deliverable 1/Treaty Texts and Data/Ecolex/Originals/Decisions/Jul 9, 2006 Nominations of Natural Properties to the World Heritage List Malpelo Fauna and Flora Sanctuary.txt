Inscribes  the  Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary, Colombia,  on the World Heritage List on the basis of natural criteria (ii) and (iii):     Criterion (ii):  As the largest no-fishing zone in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, the Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary is a globally significant and largely pristine marine protected area with unaltered and non-threatened ecosystems, free of invasive species, that is essential to maintain and replenish the population of sharks, giant grouper and billfish in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, whilst providing unique opportunities for ecosystem conservation, research, and recreational diving.    Criterion (iii):  Malpelo\'s pristine underwater environment is of striking natural beauty because of the incredibly rich and diverse marine life; and major aggregations of large predator fish. Visitation to this site is an exhilarating experience for divers, and has been featured in specialized diving periodicals around the world.    3.
