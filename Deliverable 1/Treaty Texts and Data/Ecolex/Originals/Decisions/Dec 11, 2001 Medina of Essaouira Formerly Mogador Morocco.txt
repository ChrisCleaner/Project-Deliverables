Property:  Medina   of Essaouira (Formerly Mogador)  \n Id. N&deg;:  753 Rev  \n State Party:  Morocco    \n Criteria:  C (ii) (iv)  \n The Committee inscribed the Medina of Essaouira (Formerly Mogador) on the World Heritage List under criteria (ii) and (iv): \n  Criterion (ii):  Essaouira is an outstanding and well preserved example of a late 18th century European fortified seaport town translated to a North African context. \n  Criterion (iv):  With the opening up of Morocco to the rest of the world in the later 17th century Essaouira was laid out by a French architect who had been profoundly influenced by the work of Vauban at Saint-Malo. It has retained its European appearance to a substantial extent. \n A number of delegates expressed their reservations as to the outstanding universal value of the site, as well as some concerns on the reported alterations that had taken place in the city, where inappropriate materials had been used for modern additions. ICOMOS informed the Committee that although some degree of integrity had been lost in the past, the degree of loss did not compromise the overall significance of the site. Adequate safeguarding measures and a comprehensive Management Plan were now in place, which would prevent further damage to the historic structures of the city. \n &nbsp;
