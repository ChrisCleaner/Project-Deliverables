The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Having examined  Documents   WHC-05/29.COM/8B, WHC-05/29.COM/8B.Add 2   and   WHC-05/29.COM/INF.8B.1  ,  2.  Recalling  Decision  28 COM 14B.42  adopted at its 28th session (Suzhou, 2004),  3.  Inscribes  the  Incense Route and Desert Cities in the Negev  (Israel) on the World Heritage List on the basis of cultural criteria (iii) and (v):   Criterion (iii):  The Nabatean towns and their trade routes bear eloquent testimony to the economic, social and cultural importance of frankincense to the Hellenistic-Roman world. The routes also provided a means of passage not only for frankincense and other trade goods but also for people and ideas.   Criterion (v):  The almost fossilised remains of towns, forts, caravanserai and sophisticated agricultural systems strung out along the Incense route in the Negev desert, display an outstanding response to a hostile desert environment and one that flourished for five centuries. 4.  Decides  to modify the name of the nomination, as " The Incense Route -   Desert cities in the Negev";  \xc2\xa0   5.  Requests  the State Party of Israel to implement the existing archaeological strategy for the whole property and for each of the major towns;  6.  Recommends  that the State Party amplifies existing management plans and conservation projects.
