ICOMOS reported on various factors of a financial and socio-economic nature that threaten the site and hinder its proper conservation. : COMOS reported however, that there is little need to send individual experts or groups of experts on urban heritage, given the comprehensive and carefully reasoned analysis and diagnosis on the conservation problems prepared by the local authorities and group of professionals. \n ICOMOS suggested, given the analysis and diagnosis that is already available in Saint Petersburg and other cities in the world, to organize a symposium on heritage conservation in major urban/metropolitan areas. The Rapporteur and the Delegate fromSenegal supported the suggestion, indicating that the problems in Saint Petersburg are in fact similar to those in the Medinas of Fez and Tunis, which would call for a regional/inter-regional approach. The Bureau recommended that the Centre and ICOMOS look into the possibilities of organizing (a) small seminar(s) on urban heritage conservation in urban/metropolitan areas.
