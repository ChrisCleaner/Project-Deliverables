The World Heritage Committee, \n 1. Having examined Documents  WHC-08/32.COM/8B  and  WHC-08/32.COM/INF.8B1,  \n 2. Defers the examination of the nomination of the  Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong ,  Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea , to the World Heritage List in order to allow the State Party to: \n \n a) reconsider and sufficiently justify the selection of the nominated properties as significant and representative examples of the Koryo Dynasty and its capital Kaesong; \n b) redefine the boundaries of the property and the buffer zones in order to include all the significant heritage components and the cultural and natural settings of the nominated properties. This consideration could take into account the possibility of linking some monuments and sites in Kaesong by extending the buffer zones in order to encompass significant examples of traditional architecture; \n c) ensure that potential threats to the values of the property caused by future development can be managed by the definition of appropriate buffer zones; \n \n 3. Recommends that, in case of a revised nomination, as the property and buffer zones must be revised by the State Party, an on-site mission should be arranged to test the appropriateness of the new proposed boundaries; \n 4. Further recommends that: \n \n a) the Management Plan should take into account the impact of the current economic transformation of the region and its potential effects on social and cultural aspects that could impact the nominated monuments and sites. This should be especially considered for properties located in Kaesong; \n b) in order to improve the monitoring system, it is necessary to review some indicators so as to define exactly what to measure, and to improve and update the documentation techniques.
