Cologne   Cathedral   \n  292Rev.   \n  Germany     \n  C(i) (ii)   (iv)   \n The Committee decided to inscribe the nominated property on the basis of cultural criteria (i), (ii) and (iv) considering that the monument is of outstanding universal value being an exceptional work of human creative genius, constructed over more than six centuries and a powerful testimony to the strength and persistence of Christian belief in medieval and modern Europe. \n The Committee suggested that protective legislation should be set up which would ensure that new constructions around the property would be in conformity with the architectural significance of the Cathedral. \n The French Delegation emphasized the importance of the inscription of Cologne Cathedral which is justified not only for its medieval architecture but also for the restoration and completion of the work begun early in the 19th century. This recognition reflects the significance of present-day research on historicism. \n &nbsp;
