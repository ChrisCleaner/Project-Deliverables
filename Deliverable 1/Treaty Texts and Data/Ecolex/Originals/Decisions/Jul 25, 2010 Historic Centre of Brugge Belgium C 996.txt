The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-10/34.COM/7B.Add, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  33 COM 7B.94  adopted at its 33rd session (Seville, 2009), \n 3.  Expresses its concern  regarding the conclusions of the mission that indicate the gradual erosion of the attributes that convey the Outstanding Universal Value and, consequently, this erosion threatens the integrity of the property in terms of overall coherence and distinctiveness; \n 4.  Strongly recommends  to the State Party to implement the recommendations of the mission, in particular: \n a) Explore ways to list the property in the framework of national legislation as an "urban landscape" to protect the coherence and the overall urban form, \n b) Undertake the study of the specific urban areas to define the urban typology and the conditions for possible future development, \n c) Promote clearer and more effective links between the development interests of the city and the need to conserve the Historic Centre of Brugge, by incorporating the requirements of heritage conservation into regional planning documents, \n d) Identify important views from and towards the property and incorporate their protection into urban planning documents, \n e) Strengthen governance of the property to make it more proactive and incorporate this into the approved urban plan based on the approved Statement of Outstanding Universal Value, \n f) Envisage the establishment of an advisory panel of experts specifically created for the property inscribed on the World Heritage List, that may be consulted as regards important projects and provide advice on their suitability at an early stage; \n 5.  Requests  the State Party to develop by  1 February 2011 , in consultation with the World Heritage Centre and the Advisory Bodies, a draft Statement of Outstanding Universal Value for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 36th session in 2012; \n 6.  Also requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre by  1 February 2012 , a detailed report on progress achieved in the implementation of the above-mentioned recommendations for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 36th session in 2012.
