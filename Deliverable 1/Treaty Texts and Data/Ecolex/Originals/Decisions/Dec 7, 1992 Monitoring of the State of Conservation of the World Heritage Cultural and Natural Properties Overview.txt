VIII.1 The World Heritage Centre introduced document WHC&shy;92/CONF.002/5 and stressed the fact that ensuring the maintenance of the values for which sites were given World Heritage status and taking measures to remove or minimize threats to those values is a major part of the work of the Committee, the non-governmental advisory bodies and the Centre. The Committee noted that the monitoring of the state of conservation of World Heritage sites will receive greater emphasis than the identification and designation of sites in the future work of the Convention. The Committee took note of the fact that the methodology used to monitor the state of conservation of World Heritage properties in the Latin American and the Caribbean region is to be adapted and extended to other regions. In 1993 it was decided that monitoring will be applied to 48 sites: \n \n 17 are in the Latin American and the Caribbean region (continuing programme);  \n 24&nbsp; in the Mediterranean region (continuing programme); \n 7 in the African and Asia-Pacific region, respectively (new programmes). \n \n &nbsp;
