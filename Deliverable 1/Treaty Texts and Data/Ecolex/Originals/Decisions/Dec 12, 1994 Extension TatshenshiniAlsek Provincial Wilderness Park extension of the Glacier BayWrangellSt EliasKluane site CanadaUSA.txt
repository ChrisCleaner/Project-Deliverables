Tatshenshini-Alsek   Provincial Wilderness Park   (extension of the Glacier Bay/Wrangell/St. Elias/Kluane site)  \n  72bis/rev.  \n  Canada  /USA  \n  N(ii) (iii) (iv)  \n The Committee inscribed this site as an extension to the Glacier Bay/Wrangell/St. Elias/Kluane World Heritage site. \n The Committee commended the Government of British Columbia/Canada on the action taken to protect the area and it complimented the government agencies involved in moving towards the establishment of an International Advisory Council. The Committee noted that the World Heritage designation of this area does not prejudice the titles and rights to land used by the Champagne-Aishihik First Nations. The Committee suggested that the two states Parties may consider proposing a new and shorter title, e.g. "St. Elias Mountain Parks" to the site. \n &nbsp;
