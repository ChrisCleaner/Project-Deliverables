The  Ninth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. IX/23:      To note that despite the phase-out of the production and consumption of CFCs by 1 January 1996 in Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5, CFCs continue to remain available in fairly significant quantities in a number of such Parties, thereby preventing the timely elimination of the use and emissions of CFCs;   To note that information suggests that illegal trade in CFCs is contributing to their continued availability, and therefore to increased and unnecessary damage to the ozone layer;   To note that apart from agreed exempted uses, the continued supply of new CFCs is no longer necessary, as technically and economically feasible alternatives are widely available;   To request non-Article 5 Parties to consider banning the placing on the market and sale of virgin CFCs, except to meet the basic domestic needs of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and other exempted uses. Parties may also consider extending this ban to include other substances listed in Annex A and B to the Montreal Protocol and recovered, recycled and reclaimed substances, provided that adequate steps are taken to ensure their disposal;   To request the Parties concerned to report to the Secretariat in time for the Eleventh Meeting of the Parties on action taken under this decision.
