The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.&nbsp; Having examined  Document WHC-11/35.COM/7A, \n 2.&nbsp; Recalling  Decision  34 COM 7A.2 , adopted at its 34th session (Brasilia, 2010), \n 3.&nbsp; Notes with concern  the continuing&nbsp; political crisis in C&ocirc;te d\'Ivoire, which has lead to the further intensification of illegal activities within Como&eacute; National Park since 2002, including poaching and encroachment by cattle and agriculture; \n 4.&nbsp; Acknowledges  the efforts made by the State Party and its conservation partners to reinforce the surveillance of the property, to develop a management plan, and to undertake a survey of the property\'s wildlife, but  notes  that as a result of the political crisis, only a few mixed ranger patrols have been deployed, resulting in little effective control and patrolling of the property; \n 5.&nbsp; Expresses its utmost concern  about the results of the 2010 survey which show that the property has lost an estimated 80% of its large mammals in the last three decades and that its ecosystem has been seriously affected by the conversion of large areas to cattle grazing and agriculture, which demonstrates that the property\'s Outstanding Universal Value is seriously compromised, but that there remains potential for the recovery of the property\'s wildlife and ecosystems if urgent action is taken; \n 6.&nbsp; Decides  to amend the corrective measures in line with the above in order to reflect the priority actions that are needed to conserve and restore the property\'s Outstanding Universal Value, and therefore  adopts  the following additional corrective measure: \n Restore, as a matter of urgency, the integrity of the property by removing cattle and addressing agricultural encroachment; \n 7.&nbsp; Urges  the State Party to implement the revised corrective measures adopted by the Committee at its 35th session (UNESCO, 2011); \n 8.&nbsp; Encourages  the State Party\'s conservation partners, including Global Environment Faciltiy (GEF)/World Bank, Wild Chimpanzee Foundation (WCF), German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), Fauna and Flora International (FFI), IUCN and others, to continue their support for the property; \n 9.&nbsp; Requests  the State Party to confirm officially that no mining exploration licenses covering the property have been granted; \n 10.&nbsp; Also requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2012 , a detailed report on the state of conservation of the property and on the implementation of the revised corrective measures, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 36th session in 2012; \n 11.&nbsp;  Decides  to retain Como&eacute; National Park (C&ocirc;te d\'Ivoire) on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
