Noting with appreciation  the 2008 report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel;   Recalling  Decision X/14 in which all Parties are asked to report to the Secretariat annually by 30\xc2\xa0September on their use of controlled substances as process agents, the levels of emissions from those uses and the containment technologies used by them to minimize emissions of controlled substances;   Noting  that the report by Executive Committee on process agent uses in Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol (UNEP/Oz.L.Pro.WG.1/29/4) found that the adoption of technology that results in zero emissions of ozone-depleting substances used as process agents has become the norm in Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol;   Noting  that reporting by Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 on approved process agent projects under the Multilateral Fund does not replace the need to submit the required information under Decision X/14 to the Ozone Secretariat;   Noting with concern  that only two Parties reported information consistent with Decision X/14 and that such limited data has impeded the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel in undertaking the level of analysis required;   Also noting  that such limited information reported by Parties puts at risk the current exclusion of process agent uses of controlled substances from a Party\xe2\x80\x99s annual consumption calculation;  1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request all Parties with process agent uses of controlled substances to submit the information required by Decision X/14 by 30 September each year to the Ozone Secretariat;  2.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To clarify that the annual reporting obligation shall not apply once a Party informs the Ozone Secretariat they do not use ozone-depleting substances as process agents as under Decision X/14, until they start doing so, and that this one-time procedure pertains to all Parties whether or not they are listed in Table B of Decision X/14;  3.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Ozone Secretariat every year to write to those Parties that did not submit a document as under paragraph 2, report, requesting them to submit information consistent with Decision X/14;   4.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Ozone Secretariat to bring cases of non-reporting to the attention of the Implementation Committee for consideration;  5.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund to prepare a joint report for future meetings, reporting on progress with phasing out process-agent applications, as sought by Decision XVII/6 (paragraph 6);  6.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To revisit this issue at the 30th Meeting of the Open-ended Working Group;  7.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To update Table A of Decision X/14 as per the Annex to this decision;  8.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To update Table B of Decision X/14 as per the Annex to this decision;
