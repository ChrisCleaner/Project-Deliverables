29. The Bureau was concerned that the site was being degraded by unregulated tourism and water pollution and hence requested the Secretariat to contact the Turkish authorities and request them to (a) declare this site a national park as soon as possible, as the Committee had recommended at the time of its being listed in 1988; and (b) host a national workshop for discussing the various threats faced by this site in order to develop a management plan for the site. \n 30. The Bureau also noted information pertaining to the state of conservation of Hawaiian Volcanoes National Park (United States), Canadian Rockies National Park (Canada), Keoladeo National Park (India), Tasmanian Wilderness (Australia), Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve (Honduras) and Wood Buffalo National Park (Canada). \n 31. The Bureau noted that for most of the sites, the reported threats to integrity originated from national agencies with interests other than conservation. The Bureau therefore encouraged States Parties to ensure greater inter-agency co-ordination to ensure the conservation of sites. The Bureau stressed that the impacts of tourism, particularly nature-tourism, needed special attention. The Bureau also requested that the Secretariat and IUCN should continuously monitor international assistance provided from the World Heritage Fund to ensure that funds are used for the most urgent conservation needs of world heritage sites.
