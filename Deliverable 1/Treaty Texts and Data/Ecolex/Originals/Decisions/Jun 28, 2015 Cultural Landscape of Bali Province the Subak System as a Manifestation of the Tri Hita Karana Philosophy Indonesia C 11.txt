The World Heritage Committee, \n \n  Having examined  Document WHC-15/39.COM/7B.Add, \n  Recalling  Decision  38 COM 7B.  14 , adopted at its 38th session (Doha, 2014), \n  Commends  the State Party for having invited an Advisory mission to share concerns and issues raised by the Committee; and  notes  that the commitments made at the time of inscription for effective management to protect the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of the property still remain high; \n  Notes with concern  that the pressure for land conversion remains significant, creating a considerable vulnerability that is challenging the ability of the authorities to sustain OUV and that, although it was envisaged at the time of inscription that there would be full engagement of the subak farming communities with the Governing Council for the effective implementation of the management plan, this seems not to have been effectively implemented; \n  Takes note  that improvements are being introduced to engage communities more effectively through new Forum Coordination mechanisms, although it is too early to evaluate the effectiveness of this mechanism for the overall management of the property; \n  Also commends  the action taken by one Regency to provide tax incentives to the farmers; and  also notes  that the establishment of financial mechanisms to support all the traditional subaks and reduce pressure for land conversion is a continuing priority; \n  Further notes  that no comprehensive tourism strategy is in place covering all regencies; \n  Also takes note  of the importance highlighted by the mission regarding the protection of water catchment areas for the survival of the subak system; \n  Requests  the State Party, in order to strengthen the overall management processes and to address these issues, to implement the recommendations of the Advisory mission as a matter of priority, including the development of the following on an on-going and long-term basis:\n \n Engagement between the Province and Regency Governments and the Forum Coordination, \n Financial and other incentives to support the livelihoods of subak communities, \n Means to safeguard the water catchment area, essential for the healthy functioning of the subak system, \n More effective coordination in relation to land conversion processes, and changes in land use, including new developments, \n Action Plans to reflect the wide range of issues that impact on the property, \n Effective mechanisms for strategic planning, \n Impact assessments for new developments in the property and its wider setting, \n Detailed and strategic cultural tourism planning; \n \n \n  Also requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 December 2016 , an updated report, including a 1-page executive summary, on the state of conservation of the property and the implementation of the above, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 41st session in 2017.
