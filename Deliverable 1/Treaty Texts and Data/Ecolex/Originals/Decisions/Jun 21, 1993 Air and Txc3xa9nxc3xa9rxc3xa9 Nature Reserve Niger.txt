The Bureau recalled that the Committee, at its last session, included this site in the List of World Heritage in Danger because it was concerned that the region in which it is situated has  been  affected by civil disturbance and that six members of the Reserve staff were being held hostage since February 1992. The Bureau deeply regretted that two of the six Reserve staff who had been held hostage died during their captivity and the health of the other four who were released in April 1993 was found to be poor. The Bureau instructed the Centre to transmit the Committee\'s condolences to the families of Messrs Mamadou Cheffou and Alassoum Oumarou who died whilst being held captive. Furthermore, the Bureau also expressed the wish that the four members of the Reserve staff who were released in April 1993 would soon regain their health. The Bureau noted that the Government of Niger has initiated informal negotiations with armed opposition and encouraged the authorities to continue the dialogue with a view to finding an early solution to the conflict in the region.
