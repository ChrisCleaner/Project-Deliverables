Property:  Rietveld Schr&ouml;derhuis (Rietveld Schr&ouml;der House)  \n Id. N&deg;:  965  \n State Party:  Netherlands    \n Criteria:  C (i) (ii)  \n The Committee decided to inscribe this property on the World Heritage List on the basis of  criteria (i) and (ii) : \n  Criterion (i) : The Rietveld Schr&ouml;derhuis in Utrecht is an icon of the Modern Movement in architecture and an outstanding expression of human creative genius in its purity of ideas and concepts as developed by the  De Stijl  movement. \n  Criterion (ii) : With its radical approach to design and the use of space, the Rietveld Schr&ouml;derhuis occupies a seminal position in the development of architecture in the modern age. \n Following an extensive debate on the application of criterion  (vi)  to this particular site and in general, and at the request of several delegates, the Delegate of Zimbabwe (Rapporteur) informed the Committee that during the meeting "Authenticity and Integrity in the African Context" held recently in Zimbabwe, the application of criterion  (vi) , as well as, of criterion  (i)  was debated at considerable length. He therefore proposed, upon completion of the report of that meeting, to transmit it to the Committee in order to enable the Committee to continue discussions on this matter. \n The Committee therefore decided to defer the the application of criterion  (vi)  to this property. \n &nbsp;
