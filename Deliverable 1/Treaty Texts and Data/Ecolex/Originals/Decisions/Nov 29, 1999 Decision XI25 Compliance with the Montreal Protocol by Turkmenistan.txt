The  Eleventh Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XI/25:      To note that Turkmenistan acceded to the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol on 18 November 1993 and acceded to the London Amendment on 15 March 1994. The country is classified as a non-Article 5 Party under the Protocol and, for 1996, reported positive consumption of 29.6 ODP tonnes of Annex A and B substances, none of which was for essential uses exempted by the Parties. As a consequence, in 1996 Turkmenistan was in non-compliance with its control obligations under Articles 2A through 2E of the Montreal Protocol;   To note with appreciation the work done by Turkmenistan in cooperation with the Global Environment Facility to develop a country programme and establish a phase-out plan to bring Turkmenistan into compliance with the Montreal Protocol in 2003;   To note that Turkmenistan, in cooperation with the Global Environment Facility, had delineated the following draft benchmarks that could serve to measure progress in the phase-out process until 2003:     1999: Import of CFCs should not exceed 22 ODP tonnes;   1 January 2000: Import/export licensing system in place; bans on import of equipment using and containing ODS; import quota for CFCs in 2000 not exceeding 15 ODP tonnes (roughly 50 per cent compared to 1996)   1 January 2000: Ban on the import of all Annex A and B substances except CFCs listed in Annex A (1);   1 January 2000: Import quota for CFCs in 2001 not exceeding 10 ODP tonnes (-66 per cent compared to 1996); effective system for monitoring and controlling ODS trade in place and working;   1 July 2001: recovery and recycling and training projects completed;   1 January 2002: Import quota for CFCs in 2002 not to exceed 6 ODP tonnes (-80 per cent compared to 1996);   1 January 2003: Total prohibition of imports of Annex A and B substances/zero quota; completion of Global Environment Facility project.     To monitor closely the progress of Turkmenistan with regard to the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances, particularly towards meeting the specific commitments noted above and, in this regard, to request that Turkmenistan submit a complete copy of its country programme when approved, including the specific benchmarks, to the Implementation Committee, through the Ozone Secretariat, for its consideration at its next meeting. To the degree that Turkmenistan is working towards and meeting the specific time-based commitments noted above and continues to report data annually demonstrating a decrease in imports and consumption, Turkmenistan should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In this regard, Turkmenistan should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet these commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that might be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through this decision, however, the Parties caution Turkmenistan, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that the country fails to meet the commitments noted above in the times specified, the Parties shall consider measures, consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. These measures could include the possibility of actions that may be available under Article 4, designed to ensure that the supply of CFCs and halons that is the subject of non-compliance is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
