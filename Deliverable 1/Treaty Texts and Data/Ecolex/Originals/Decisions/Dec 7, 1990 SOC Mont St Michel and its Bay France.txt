26. As the Bureau requested during its last session, the French representative reported on the siltation problems at  Mont St. Michel   and its Bay.  The Committee noted with satisfaction the planned siltation control works, including   the demolition of the dike providing access to Mont St. Michel and its present parking facilities and the replacement of this dike with a bridge that will reestablish water circulation. The Committee wished to encourage the French authorities to implement these projects as soon as possible. \n &nbsp;
