Recalling that the nomination by Argentina had not initially been contemplated for examination at the Committee\'s present session because of the annual limit set out in paragraph 61 of the  Operational Guidelines , \n 2. Noting that withdrawals of nominations had opened an opportunity for the nomination of Argentina to come within the aforesaid annual limit planned for examination, \n 3. Having been informed by Argentina that because of this unforeseen and possible prejudicial development it did not wish to have its nomination examined at the 32nd session; \n 4.
