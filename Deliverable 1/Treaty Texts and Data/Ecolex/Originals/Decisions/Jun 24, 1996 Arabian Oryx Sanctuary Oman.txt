The Centre received a progress report, dated March 1996, on the ongoing planning activities for the site and a schedule of activities. IUCN noted several recent developments in the Sanctuary that are of concern: (1) the poaching of thirteen Oryx and (2) the construction of a reverse osmosis plant which has resulted in significant damage to the desert habitat. The Bureau requested the Centre to contact the Omani authorities encouraging them to provide the definition of the final boundaries of the site and expressing concern over the poaching and construction activities.
