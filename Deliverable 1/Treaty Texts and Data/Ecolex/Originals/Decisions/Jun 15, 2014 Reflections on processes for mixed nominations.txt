The World Heritage Committee, \n \n  Having examined  Document WHC-14/38.COM/9B ,   \n  Recalling  Decision  37 COM 8B.19  adopted at its 37th session (Phnom Penh, 2013), \n  Welcomes  the detailed report made by the World Heritage Centre and the Advisory Bodies on mixed sites and related evaluation processes; \n  Acknowledges  from that report that the review of the decision processes for mixed nominations reveals that in most cases these appear to be more complex than those sites nominated for only cultural or natural values and might require more time at the preparatory stage of the nomination; \n  Further acknowledges  the complexities for the Advisory Bodies evaluating in relation to the completeness check of nominations, the re-nomination under new criteria of already inscribed sites to become mixed properties and preparation of draft decisions; \n  Takes note  of the project undertaken by the Advisory Bodies on evaluation procedures of mixed nominations, to be completed by 2015, and  requests  them to prepare, for State Party comment, a discussion document including options for changes to the criteria and to the Advisory Body evaluation process for mixed nominations; \n  Encourages  the States Parties to fully consider the potential and constraints of nominating mixed sites at the earliest stages, and to seek early and proactive advice from the Advisory Bodies and the World Heritage Centre for such nominations, in compliance with Paragraph 122 of the  Operational Guidelines  and  urges  States Parties to take full advantage of the Upstream Process to avoid significant problems during the nomination process; \n  Also requests  the World Heritage Centre, IUCN and ICOMOS to prepare an updated joint report on this matter, including options for changes to the criteria and to the Advisory Body evaluation process for mixed nominations, for consideration by the World Heritage Committee at its 39th session in 2015.
