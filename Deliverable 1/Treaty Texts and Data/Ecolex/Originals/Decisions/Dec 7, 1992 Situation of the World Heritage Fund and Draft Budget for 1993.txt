XII.1 The Committee examined the document WHC&shy;92/CONF.002/9 which presented the situation of the contributions to the World Heritage Fund for the years 1981 to 1992. Noting with satisfaction that a certain number of States Parties had paid, within the given delay, either their obligatory contribution or their voluntary contribution, the Committee remarked with concern that many States Parties had not yet paid their obligatory contributions. Sometimes the outstanding contributions covered several bienniums. The Committee therefore strongly appealed to the States Parties concerned requesting them to make their outstanding contributions to the Fund as soon as possible and so contribute to minimizing the impact of budgetary constraints on the development and the implementation of the Convention. \n XII.2 A working group under the Chairperson of the Committee examined the budgetary proposals presented by the World Heritage Centre and the advisory bodies (ICCROM, ICOMOS and IUCN). Also, it examined the approved proposal concerning the programmes which was approved by the Bureau for monitoring carried out by certain organisms in the Latin American and Caribbean region on the one hand, (US$60, 000) and on the other the Mediterranean region (US$20,000). It also examined the proposals for international assistance and monitoring programmes proposed in the framework of the implementation of the new strategies for the Sub-Saharian African region, and that for Asia and the Pacific (US$20, 000) and for the Workshop on Monitoring Methodology (US$25,000). \n XII.3 On the recommendation of the Bureau, the Committee adopted the proposals presented by the Working Group on the budget and decided to reserve a special line for monitoring, in conformity with the new strategic orientations, and another for assistance for the participation of experts (LDC and DC) to statutory meetings of the Committee, in application of a previous decision taken by the Committee. Furthermore, it recalled the express decision of the Bureau, that the possibility of transferring, from one line to another, of credits allocated but not yet engaged could not in any case apply to credits for Emergency Assistance. Finally, the Committee considered that the "Reserve Funds" would be credited by excess budgetary resources and that recourse to this "Reserve Fund" would always remain dependant upon a specific Bureau decision. \n XII.4 Before the adoption of the budget for 1993 by consensus, the Delegate of Thailand expressed some reserves. He recommended that in the future, all the budgetary documents be transmitted to the members of the Committee in sufficient time for them to be fully studied, independent of the constraints of the agenda of the session. The Committee approved this recommendation. \n XII.5 The Committee adopted the following budget for 1993: \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n  Items  \n \n \n  1993  \n \n \n \n \n 1.

The Centre should also present detailed budgetary proposals for 1994; \n b) that the World Heritage Centre should indicate in its budgetary report to the Committee concerning Preparatory Assistance, Training and Technical Co-operation, the projects which have been approved by the Committee so as to take into account the ceiling of 20% (for all three items) for projects not approved by the Committee; \n c) that before each ordinary Committee session, the World Heritage Centre should provide the Committee with a global budgetary report to permit the Committee to better understand the justification for temporary assistance requested by the Centre; \n d) that the amount allocated for promotion in 1993 should not attain, with regard to the CD-ROM programme, an amount of 25% fixed in the detailed project budget. The Centre should present to the Bureau a report on the evaluation and implementation of this programme. The continuation of this programme (after end-1993) will be decided in the light of this report; \n e) that no funds allocated for temporary assistance can be used for the purchase of equipment or furniture for offices; \n f) that the World Heritage Centre should provide the Committee at its next session with a complete budgetary report on the sum accumulated through World Heritage Fund investments. \n B.&nbsp;The Committee recommended the following: \n a) to ensure the scientific quality of operations to be carried out in the field (preparatory assistance, technical co-operation, etc.) it is indispensable to use the services of experts, not only highly competent in their field but also having a wide knowledge of the cultures concerned. \n b) As far as possible and to make appreciable reduction in costs, it is recommended to make use of expertise available in the region concerned. \n c) With regard to training, whether local, regional or international, it is recommended to call upon, to the extent possible, the advice and services of IUCN and ICCROM. \n This method can, also be considered as contributing towards lowering costs. \n d) The participation of highly qualified experts is recommended in each action necessary for the safeguarding of the heritage (be it archeology and the history of art, conservation techniques for architecture or engineering, physical or chemical methods, or management techniques). \n Whenever necessary, call will be made upon this expertise, working as closely together as possible with the specialized organizations concerned. \n XII.7 Noting the comments of IUCN and IOCMOS on their budget allocations, the Committee proposed that these questions of-giving supplementary allocations be examined by the Bureau at its next meeting upon submission of appropriate justifications. \n &nbsp;
