The World Heritage Committee; \n 1.&nbsp; Having examined  Document WHC-10/34.COM/7B, \n 2.&nbsp; Recalling  Decision  33 COM 7B.35 , adopted at its 33rd session (Seville, 2009), \n 3.&nbsp; Notes with utmost concern  that the dams currently under construction on the Changuinola and Bonyic rivers are highly likely to result in both the direct loss of up to 16 species of migratory fish and shrimp, as well as having potential negative secondary impacts on biodiversity within the property; \n 4.&nbsp; Considers  that the mitigation measures proposed to maintain the migratory corridors of the affected species, namely fish passes and aquaculture, are inadequate to effectively mitigate the impacts of the proposed dams; \n 5.&nbsp; Requests  the Government of Panama and the Government of Costa Rica to consider the collective impact of all proposed dams, including those under construction, likely to affect the property\'s Outstanding Universal Value and conditions of integrity through a transboundary strategic environmental assessment (SEA), in order to identify the least environmentally damaging options to meet energy and water management needs; \n 6.&nbsp; Also requests  the State Party of Panama to halt all dam constructions until a detailed transboundary strategic environmental assessment process is undertaken, in order to safeguard the property\'s values and integrity; \n 7.&nbsp; Also notes with concern  the State Party of Panama\'s intention to build a road traversing the property from north Boquete to the province of Bocas del Toro, which would seriously degrade its integrity, and  further requests  the State Party to submit any preliminary environmental assessments to the World Heritage Centre as soon as these become available; \n 8.&nbsp; Reiterates its request  to the State Party that measures be adopted to ensure the complete removal of cattle from the property; \n 9.&nbsp; Recalls its request  to the Governments of Panama and Costa Rica to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2011 , a joint report on the state of conservation of the property, and  requests furthermore  that this report include an update on the progress achieved in undertaking a transboundary dam strategic environmental assessment, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 35th session in 2011,  with a view to considering, in the absence of substantial progress, the possible inscription of the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
