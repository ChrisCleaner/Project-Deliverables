VII.20 Skocjan Caves (Slovenia)  \n The Committee recalled that the site was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1986 and took note of the report by IUCN on the field mission outlining that the size of the site had been expanded from 200 to 400 ha to better control the surface area of the underground caves. Actions by the State Party included expenditure of US$ 22 million on upstream pollution control, strengthening legislation, consideration of a buffer zone and proposals for new park offices and visitor facilities. The Delegate of Germany asked for clarification concerning the extended boundaries of the site. \n The Committee commended the Slovenian authorities for taking significant actions to protect the site. The Committee requested the Centre to contact the authorities to provide a map of the revised boundaries and to encourage the State Party to finalize the new legislation and to begin the preparation of a management plan. \n &nbsp;
