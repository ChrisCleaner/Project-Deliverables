The World Heritage Committee,   1. Having examined  Documents WHC-07/31.COM/8B and WHC-07/31.COM/INF.8B.2,  2. Inscribes  the  Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians, Slovakia and Ukraine,  on the World Heritage List on the basis of  criterion (ix) :  3. Adopts  the following Statement of Outstanding Universal Value:  The Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians are a serial property comprising ten components.\xc2\xa0 They represent an outstanding example of undisturbed, complex temperate forests and exhibit the most complete and comprehensive ecological patterns and processes of pure stands of European beech across a variety of environmental conditions.\xc2\xa0 They contain an invaluable genetic reservoir of beech and many species associated and dependent on these forest habitats.   Criterion (ix):  The Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians are indispensable to understanding the history and evolution of the genus Fagus, which, given its wide distribution in the Northern Hemisphere and its ecological importance, is globally significant.\xc2\xa0 These undisturbed, complex temperate forests exhibit the most complete and comprehensive ecological patterns and processes of pure stands of European beech across a variety of environmental conditions.\xc2\xa0 Beech is one of the most important elements of forests in the Temperate Broad-leaf Forest Biome and represents an outstanding example of the re-colonisation and development of terrestrial ecosystems and communities after the last ice age, a process which is still ongoing.  The individual components of this serial property are of sufficient size to maintain the natural processes necessary for the long-term ecological viability of the property\'s habitats and ecosystems.\xc2\xa0 Effective implementation of the integrated management plan is required to guide the planning and management of this serial property.\xc2\xa0 Key management issues include forest fire control and conservation of monumental old trees, conservation and management of mountain meadows, river corridors and freshwater ecosystems, tourism management, research, and monitoring.  4. Commends  the States Parties of Slovakia and Ukraine for addressing IUCN\'s previous recommendation to work together and bringing forward a transboundary nomination of the Beech Primeval Forests of the Carpathians;  5. Recommends  the States Parties of Slovakia and Ukraine to:  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 a) Enhance implementation of the existing Integrated Management Plan and establish a functional Joint Management Committee as proposed by the States Parties;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 b) Include in the Integrated Management Plan provisions for input from local citizens, NGOs and other interest groups;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 c) Give priority in the Integrated Management Plan to research and monitoring as this, considering the volume and relevance of existing baseline data and information for the sites included in this serial nomination, can provide a valuable contribution to understanding the potential impact of global climate change;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 d) Explore options to provide additional funds to support the effective implementation of the Integrated Management Plan and the work of the Joint Management Committee; and  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 e) Clearly mark on the ground the boundaries of all the sites included in this serial nomination.  \xc2\xa0
