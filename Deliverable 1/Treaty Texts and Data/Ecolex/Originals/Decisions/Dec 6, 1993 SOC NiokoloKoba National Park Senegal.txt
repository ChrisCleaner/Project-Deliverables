Niokolo-Koba   National Park (Senegal)  \n The Representative of IUCN informed the Committee that the road project was almost completed and that the University of Dakar had finished an environmental assessment study on the impacts of the road construction. A donors\' round table was held in June and has led to a project supported by the French Government for the future management of the Park. The Centre was requested to transmit the Committee\'s views to the appropriate authorities in Senegal and to be kept informed about the long-term effects of the improved road access on the Park. In the light of the fortieth anniversary of the Park in 1994, the Centre was asked to collaborate with the Park authorities in marking this event. \n &nbsp;
