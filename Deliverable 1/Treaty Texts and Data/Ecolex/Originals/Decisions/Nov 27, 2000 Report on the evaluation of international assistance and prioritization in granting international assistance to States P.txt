XIV.1 Report on the evaluation of international assistance and prioritization in granting international assistance to States Parties  \n The attention of the Committee was drawn to WHC-2000/CONF.204/16, the Report on the evaluation of international assistance and prioritization in granting international assistance to States Parties. The Chairperson recalled that the Committee, at its twenty-second session decided to carry out an evaluation of international assistance. The Central Evaluation Unit of UNESCO was entrusted with this evaluation, which was carried out by a French company, C3E. The evaluation was undertaken between summer 1999 and April 2000, through a study of the files of the World Heritage Centre, interviews with the States Parties, advisory bodies, and the Secretariat, followed by a meeting with all parties concerned. The evaluation did not include an impact study to permit the evaluation of the results of assistance granted to the beneficiary sites. Similarly, it did not incorporate the results of the parallel evaluation carried out by ICCROM on international training requests for cultural heritage, as ICCROM had not completed its study at the time. The Bureau, at its twenty-fourth session examined the C3E Report, and a summary of the discussions at the Bureau is contained in the Report of the Rapporteur of the twentyfourth session of the Bureau, WHC-2000/CONF.204/2, paragraphs VII.5 to VII.9. \n The Special Session in Budapest in October 2000 did not have time to discuss the C3E Report. However, the IUCN and ICCROM submitted comments on the C3E Report, which were made available at the time. \n Moreover, there have been substantial discussions for the improvement of the implementation of international assistance at the \n \n Task Force on the Implementation of the Convention \n Expert Meeting for the Revision of the  Operational Guidelines  \n \n The Committee examined the C3E Report and took note of its findings. \n &nbsp;
