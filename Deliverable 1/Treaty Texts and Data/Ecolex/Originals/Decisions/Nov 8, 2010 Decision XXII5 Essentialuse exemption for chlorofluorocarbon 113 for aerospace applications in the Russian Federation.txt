Noting  the evaluation and recommendation of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Chemicals Technical Options Committee in respect of the essential-use nomination for chlorofluorocarbon 113 (CFC-113) for aerospace applications in the Russian Federation,    Noting also  that the Russian Federation has continued to explore the possibility of importing CFC-113 to meet its aerospace industry needs from available global stocks,    Noting further  that the Russian Federation has been successful in reducing its use and emissions of CFC-113 in line with a timetable of technical transformation developed in collaboration with the Chemicals Technical Options Committee,    Noting,  however, that the Chemicals Technical Options Committee has recommended greater efforts to introduce appropriate alternatives,   1. To authorize an essential-use exemption for the production and consumption in 2011 of 100 metric tonnes of CFC-113 in the Russian Federation for chlorofluorocarbon applications in its aerospace industry;   2. To request the Russian Federation to continue to explore further the possibility of importing CFC-113 for its aerospace industry needs from available global stocks;   3. To urge the Russian Federation to continue its efforts on the introduction of alternative solvents and the adoption of newly designed equipment to complete the phase-out of CFC-113 according to an accelerated time schedule;
