V.168&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau recalled the World Heritage Committee recommendations to expand the boundaries of the World Heritage site to include the surrounding marine area and to revise the management plan. IUCN reviewed a letter from the State Party dated 26 October 2000, updating progress on these recommendations as follows: boundary extension: A marine survey has been carried out to obtain the necessary data to inform on the issue of the extension of the site. The UK Government seeks to bring forward proposals for an extension to the site by June 2002. Management Plan: It is not possible to start work on a new management plan before the determination of new boundaries. This work was expected to begin in early 2001 and is not likely to be completed in time to report to the twenty-fifth session of the Bureau.&nbsp; If the new boundaries extend beyond the nautical six-mile limit, this will raise issues related to the law of the sea administered by the International Maritime Organisation and the State Party may require the assistance of the World Heritage Centre.&nbsp; The UK Government has also placed a moratorium on all new oil licences nearer to St Kilda than those already granted. \n V.169&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau commended the State Party on progress made in addressing the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations and requests the State Party to provide a further progress report on the implementation of recommendations from the twenty-third session of the Committee by 15 September 2001.
