One member of the Bureau expressed concern regarding the project for the development of the Pyramids Plateau in Egypt, which included the building of a great wall between the archaeological area and a village settlement and the fitting out of an open-air \'Son et Lumiere\' theatre. The Bureau shared the concern expressed that the construction works might endanger that unique site; it therefore asked the Secretary to send a letter to the Egyptian Minister of Culture drawing his attention to the need to preserve the integrity of that site, which had been included in the World Heritage List. The Bureau also recommended that the Committee keep itself informed of developments and take a firm stand against any project that might be detrimental to the site. Finally, the Bureau asked that all relevant reports received by the Secretariat should be brought to the attention of the Committee in December.
