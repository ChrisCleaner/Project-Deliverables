VI.1  The Chairperson having suggested the setting up of possibly two working groups in order to facilitate the work, the Committee decided, on the proposal of Italy which was endorsed by Japan, Mexico and Niger, to set up a working group to discuss the International Assistance requests, and to organize, if necessary, the Committee\'s debate on the budget. It was likewise decided that this, as any other working group, would be open to all delegates and observers alike. \n  VI.2  The Committee also decided to create a working group which would prepare sub-items (a), (b), (c) and (d) of Agenda item 7 (reports on the state of conservation) for their subsequent discussion in the Committee in light of the debate at the Tenth session of the General Assembly of states Parties. It was also agreed that this working group, as proposed by Australia, would prepare for the Committee a set of options on the policy and methodology of systematic monitoring. \n &nbsp;
