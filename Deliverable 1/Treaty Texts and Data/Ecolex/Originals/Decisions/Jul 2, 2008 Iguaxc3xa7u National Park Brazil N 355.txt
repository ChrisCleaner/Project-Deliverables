The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-08/32.COM/7B.Add , \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  31 COM 7B.39 , adopted at its 31th session (Christchurch, 2007), \n 3.  Notes  that the Outstanding Universal Value of the property is present though degraded, but  notes with serious concern  the various specific threats which the property currently faces, in particular threats due to biodiversity and visual impacts; \n 4.  Urges  the State Party, in coordination with the State Party of Argentina, to implement the following recommendations of the 2008 World Heritage Centre / IUCN mission in order to strengthen the management and protect the biodiversity of the property: \n a) create a permanent and effective mechanism for transboundary co-operation, in particular for research, resource protection, and public use oriented to the appreciation of the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n b) continue joint efforts with the State Party of Argentina toward a coordinated revision of the management plans for the two adjacent properties, including development of shared indicators and standards for minimising visitor impacts, and establishing acceptable limits of change for biological and aesthetic values, including visual and audio impacts for all tourism and public use activities and associated infrastructure; and short-term oscillations in the water levels of the Igua&ccedil;u River and Falls; \n c) carry out a study of the short-term oscillation of water levels in the Igua&ccedil;u River and Falls to quantify biological and visual impacts, and develop a monitoring process to track change and regularly inform decision-making; \n d) carry out a study of the economic benefits of tourism to the local economies and an inventory of those local attractions that could aid in diverting visitation away from the Falls area and that would contribute to building local constituencies; \n e) develop and implement a research and monitoring strategy for the key species that were specifically listed when site was inscribed; \n f) develop a qualified Ranger Corps for the Park specially trained in addressing conservation issues; \n 5.  Also urges  the State Party to implement an early warning system to alert the World Heritage Committee to any plans for the development of a hydroelectric project on the Igua&ccedil;u River that would impact the property; \n 6.  Requests  the State Party, in consultation with the World Heritage Centre and the Advisory Bodies, to develop a draft Statement of Outstanding Universal Value including the conditions of integrity, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 33rd session in 2009; \n 7.  Also requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2010 , a report on the state of conservation of the property and on progress in the implementation of the recommendations of the 2008 mission, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010.
