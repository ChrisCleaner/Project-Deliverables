ICOMOS experts reported that conservation and restoration works are progressing steadily at the Temple of the Tooth.&nbsp; In particular, the high level of management of the site by both conservation and administration teams was noted. Given the strong public support for the conservation policy including development control of the whole city, ICOMOS experts noted that the systematic approach applied to urban conservation in Kandy could serve as a model for other relevant areas in Sri Lanka. \n Seventeen recommendations were made by the ICOMOS experts for enhancing the conservation and management of the site.&nbsp; These recommendations address: (a) the need to consult stakeholders and experts before the finalization and implementation of the comprehensive Master Plan; (b) the need to improve traffic and parking systems immediately surrounding the World Heritage site; (c) the need for better information dissemination concerning development guidelines by the local authorities; and (d) the need to redefine the core zone to include the Kandy Lake and Udawattakele which form an integral part of the site, and the buffer zone to include the mountain range of Walker Estate to preserve the skyline of the site.
