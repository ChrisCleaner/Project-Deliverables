The Bureau noted that the Croatian authorities have officially informed UNESCO that they will abide by the obligations of the World Heritage Convention and requested that a joint UNESCO/IUCN mission be undertaken to assess the impacts which unrest in the region has had on the state of conservation of Plitvice Lake National Park. The Bureau recommended that the Committee, as requested by the Croatian authorities, inscribe Plitvice Lake National Park on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Bureau also decided to set aside an amount upto US$30,000 as emergency assistance to enable the organization of a joint UNESCO/IUCN mission to the site, in co-operation with the Croatian authorities as well as the relevant UN bodies responsible for monitoring the conflict in the region, in order to prepare and initiate the implementation of an international assistance project for the rehabilitation of the Plitvice Lake National Park.
