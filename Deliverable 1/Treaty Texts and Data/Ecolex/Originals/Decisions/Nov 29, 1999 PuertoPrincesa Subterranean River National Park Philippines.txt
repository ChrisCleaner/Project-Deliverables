Property:  Puerto-Princesa Subterranean River National Park  \n Id. N\xc2\xb0:  652Rev  \n State Party:  Philippines    \n Criteria:  N (iii) (iv)  \n The Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park features a spectacular limestone karst landscape with its underground river. A distinguishing feature of the river is that it flows directly into the sea, and the lower portion of the river is subject to tidal influences. The area also represents a significant habitat for biodiversity conservation. The site contains a full mountain to the sea ecosystem and protects forests, which are among the most significant in Asia. \n The Committee decided to inscribe the site under natural  criteria (iii)  and  (iv) . It also commended the Government of the Philippines for the consultative process undertaken with relevant authorities, specially with the affected Barangays and for their approaches to integrated regional land use planning which aim to ensure that the World Heritage values of the site are maintained. \n The Observer of the Philippines informed the Committee that a tourism development plan would be provided shortly.
