41. The Committee examined the report on promotional activities which summarised the work undertaken aiming at making the Convention and the properties inscribed on the World Heritage List better known to the general public and at generating income to the World Heritage Fund. The Committee noted that due to various reasons, the Secretariat had not managed to accomplish all the activities that had been planned but that this type of activity would be given priority in the-near future. \n 42. The representatives of several States Parties expressed their interest in the ceremonies to inaugurate plaques commemorating the inscription of specific properties on the World Heritage List, at which the Director General of Unesco, or his representative, or the Chairman of the World Heritage Committee, were invited to attend. As the texts, design and material of such plaques were not always identical, the Committee requested the Secretariat to prepare guidelines on the preparation of these plaques, to be examined by the Bureau at its next session, with a view to obtaining a standard model which may be used by other States Parties as they so desired. \n &nbsp;
