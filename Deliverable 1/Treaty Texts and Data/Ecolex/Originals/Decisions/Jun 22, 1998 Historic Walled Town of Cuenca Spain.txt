After having noted the report of the Secretariat, the Bureau commended the authorities of Cuenca as well as those of the Castilla-La Mancha for the positive attitude that they adopted in favour of the appropriate protection and management of the site. The Bureau requested that the authorities present to the Secretariat, as soon as it is ready, a special plan for Cuenca, and requested the Secretariat to provide technical assistance to the Town of Cuenca to this end. The Bureau then thanked ICOMOS-Spain for the positive role they played in this matter.
