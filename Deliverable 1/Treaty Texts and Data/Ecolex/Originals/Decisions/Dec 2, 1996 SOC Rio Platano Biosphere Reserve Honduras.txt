This report noted the threats to the site, including agricultural intrusion and the implementation of land reform programmes. A number of follow-up actions, including the inscription of the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger, were recommended. Following the Committee session, the Centre requested the Honduran authorities to inform the Committee about the actions taken to protect the site.
