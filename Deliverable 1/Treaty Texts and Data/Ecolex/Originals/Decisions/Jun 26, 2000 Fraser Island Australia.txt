Concerning the reports received, IUCN noted that the IUCN Task Force on Management Effectiveness has outlined a programme to improve the monitoring of World Heritage sites and a proposal has been submitted for support of the UN Foundation. IUCN pointed out that this methodology is already being applied by the relevant Australian authorities in Fraser Island, and the State Party is to be commended for this approach. IUCN also proposed that the ACIUCN process be extended to include Fraser Island taking full account of the work undertaken on management effectiveness. \n The Bureau invited the State Party to assist ACIUCN in the possible extension of the ACIUCN assessment and consultation process to include Fraser Island and to transmit this information for the periodic report of the State Party in 2002. The Bureau requested that a progress report be submitted for information to the twenty-fourth extraordinary session of the Bureau in November 2000.
