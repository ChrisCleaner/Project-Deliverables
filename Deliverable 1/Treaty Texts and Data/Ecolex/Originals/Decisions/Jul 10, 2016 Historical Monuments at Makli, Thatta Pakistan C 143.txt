All locations should be photographed before and after the installation of the monitor and a regimen of monitoring should be implemented, beginning aggressively (every three months) and slowing down (to annual monitoring) if no change is recorded. If change is noted, more frequent (monthly) monitoring should be undertaken,   Undertake a soil investigation/geo-physical survey on the surroundings of the Mausolem of Jam Nizzamuddin, on the basis of which an intervention plan should be elaborated, also using data from crack monitors,   Stabilize all the elements that are about to fall, including Jamia Majid, Jam Nizzamuddin and a number of other monument groups. Prior to commencing work on each monument, the State Party should develop:    detailed condition mapping and documentation,   a characterization of original building fabric (e.g. stone and brick masonry, mortar, plaster, tile and glaze),   a history of interventions to understand the series of subsequent work on each building and how these may affect the development of successful interventions,   a list of compatible intervention materials, which must be informed by analysis of original fabric mentioned above,   specifications for interventions that include instructions for fabrication of intervention materials and their application and implementation,   a monitoring and maintenance plan to be implemented once the interventions are complete,       Establish a procedure to document fallen original fabric and store it carefully in appropriate storehouses. This procedure should include the following steps:    photograph materials as found in situ,   label and photograph individual elements,   store materials in a dedicated storehouse/magazine,   create and maintain an inventory of all collected items,       Document, as a matter of emergency, the existing architectural surface decoration\xe2\x80\x94such as the remaining glazed tiles\xe2\x80\x94which constitute an important part of the attributes of OUV, yet are for the most part already lost, and establish a condition report to be accompanied of damage assessment,   Resume the conservation work at the Sultan Ibrahim mausoleum, taking into account its critical state both at the structural and surface level, especially with regard to the domes and architectural surface decoration,   Immediately establish a Management Plan, including a systematic monitoring system and a plan for capacity building of the staff of the Government of Sindh\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Archaeology, without waiting for the finalization of the Master Plan;        Further requests  the State Party to finalize the Master Plan for the property and to submit it to the World Heritage Centre by  1 February 2017 , for review by the Advisory Bodies;    Finally requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2017 , an updated report on the state of conservation of the property and the implementation of the above, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 41st session in 2017,  with a view to considering, in the case of confirmation of the ascertained or potential danger to the Outstanding Universal Value, the possible inscription of the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
