The World Heritage Committee, \n \n  Having examined  Document WHC-14/38.COM/7B, \n  Recalling  Decision  36 COM 8B.26 , adopted at its 36th session (Saint-Petersburg, 2012), \n  Acknowledges  the information provided by the State Party on actions taken for the management of the property since June 2012; \n  Notes with concern  that the vulnerabilities of the cultural landscape that were acknowledged at the time of inscription, and the need to support the traditional practices of the subak communities through their engagement in the management of the property, have not been addressed clearly; \n  Regrets  that the laudable governance structures and Management Plan developed with the nomination have not been fully put in place and implemented, and that incentives and subsidies to support prosperous rural livelihoods and strong subak institutions, and land use regulations to prohibit inappropriate development within the property, have so far not been delivered as envisaged; \n  Urges  the State Party to operationalise the Governing Assembly which incorporates the traditional practices underpinning the property as envisaged in the Decree of 2010, as soon as possible, and include in its membership representatives of the subak communities; \n  Also urges  the State Party to allow the Governing Assembly to implement the approved Management Plan, as set out at the time of inscription, in order that the various multi-disciplinary Action Plans based on agreed Strategic Priorities can be delivered; \n  Requests  the State Party to consider how the various commitments for protection and management made at the time of inscription and approved by the Committee in the Statement of Outstanding Universal Value might be put into practice as soon as possible; \n In the light of the high potential vulnerability of the subak landscape,  encourages  the State Party to invite an ICOMOS/ICCROM advisory mission to the property, to be financed by the State Party, in order to consider how progress can be made in putting the management of the property on firm basis that will allow a sustainable future for the subak communities; \n  Also requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2015 , an updated report, including a 1-page executive summary, on the state of conservation of the property and the implementation of the above, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 39th session in 2015.
