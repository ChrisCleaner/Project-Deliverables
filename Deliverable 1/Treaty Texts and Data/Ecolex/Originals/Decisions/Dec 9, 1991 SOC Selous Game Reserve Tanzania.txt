Selous Game Reserve (Tanzania)  \n The Committee was glad to be informed that a proposal to open a route through this Park to drive cattle from the north to the south of the country had been abandoned by the Tanzanian Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development. If implemented, this project would have exposed the wildlife of Selous to bacterial and viral infection from the cattle and resulted in additional problems such as bush fires, dispersion of cattle, increased poaching and vegetation changes. The Committee commended the Tanzanian authorities for having dropped plans to open the route to avoid threats to the integrity of the site. \n &nbsp;
