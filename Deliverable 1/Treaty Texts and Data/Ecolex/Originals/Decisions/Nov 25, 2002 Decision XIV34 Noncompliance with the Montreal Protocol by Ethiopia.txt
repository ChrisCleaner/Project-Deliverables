The  Fourteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XIV/34:      To note that, in accordance with Decision XIII/24 of the 13th Meeting of the Parties, Ethiopia was requested to submit to the Implementation Committee a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance;   Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for Annex A, Group I substances is 34 ODP-tonnes. It reported consumption of 39 ODP-tonnes in 2000 and 35 ODP-tonnes for the control period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, placing Ethiopia clearly in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2A of the Montreal Protocol;   To express concern about Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s non-compliance but to note that it has submitted a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance. It is with that understanding that the Parties note, after reviewing the plan of action submitted by Ethiopia, that Ethiopia specifically commits itself to reduce CFC consumption from the current level of 35 ODP tonnes in 2001 as follows:     To 34 ODP tonnes in 2003;   To 17 ODP tonnes in 2005;   To 5 ODP tonnes in 2007; and   To phase out CFC consumption by 1 January 2010 as required under the Montreal Protocol save for essential uses that might be authorized by the Parties;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 3 above should enable Ethiopia to return to compliance by 2003. In this regard, the Parties urge Ethiopia to work with relevant implementing agencies to phase out consumption of ozone-depleting substances in Annex A Group I;   To closely monitor the progress of Ethiopia with regard to the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. To the degree that Ethiopia is working towards and meeting the specific commitments noted above in paragraph 3, Ethiopia should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In this regard, Ethiopia should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet these commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that might be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. However, through this decision, the Parties caution Ethiopia, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner, the Parties shall consider measures, consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. These measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of CFCs (that is the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
