Having been informed that the only remaining building of the 19 th  century still standing in the inscribed archaeological zone has been allocated to a cultural institution and aware of the risks that this use might have on the site, the Bureau requested the Lebanese authorities to take no further action which might have a negative impact on this important archaeological site and recommended that another building situated outside of the site be provided.
