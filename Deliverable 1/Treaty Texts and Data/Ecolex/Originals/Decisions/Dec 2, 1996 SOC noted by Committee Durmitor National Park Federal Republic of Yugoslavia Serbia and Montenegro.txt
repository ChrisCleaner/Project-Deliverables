VII.42   Durmitor National Park (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia   (Serbia and Montenegro))  \n \n    \nThe Bureau at its extraordinary twentieth session took note of the World Heritage Centre\'s mission to the site, inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1980. The mission reviewed the state of conservation of the site and damage at the Park Headquarters building in Zablj ak caused by a fire in 1995, which destroyed library and reference collections. The building had since been reconstructed, almost wholly refurbished and is operational. \n The mission noted the rapid unplanned and uncontrolled expansion of the village of Zabljak and adjacent development and that international assistance had been received to mitigate the mine tailing threat to the Tara River Canyon portion of the World Heritage site by earthen containment structures within the earthquake prone flood plain. The Bureau considered the situation at the site and decided the following: \n The Bureau (a) commended the authorities for their efforts to restore the Park Headquarters facility to operational level and to contain the Tara River Canyon mine tailings ; however, (b) expressed its concerns over the rapid town development within the site and lack of investment in the Park infrastructure; (c) requested clarification of possible boundary adjustments under consideration; (d) considered a possible engineering evaluation of the mine tailing containment efforts, and (e) invited the State Party to encourage the Director of the Park to participate in network and training efforts with other World Heritage site managers in the region. \n &nbsp;
