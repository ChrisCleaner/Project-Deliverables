Noting  that Bosnia and Herzegovina ratified the Montreal Protocol on 30 November 1993 and the London, Copenhagen and Montreal Amendments on 11 August 2003 and is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol,    Noting also  that the Executive Committee has approved $3,421,231 from the Multilateral Fund to enable Bosnia and Herzegovina\xe2\x80\x99s compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol,    That Bosnia and Herzegovina reported annual consumption for the controlled substances in Annex\xc2\xa0A, group I (chlorofluorocarbons), of 22.1 ODP-tonnes for 2007 and 8.8\xc2\xa0ODP\xe2\x80\x91tonnes for 2008, which exceeds the Party\xe2\x80\x99s maximum allowable consumption of 3.6 ODP-tonnes for those controlled substances for those years, and that the Party is therefore in non compliance with the control measures for those substances under the Protocol for those years;   To note with appreciation Bosnia and Herzegovina\xe2\x80\x99s submission of a plan of action to ensure its prompt return to compliance with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s chlorofluorocarbon control measures under which, without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Protocol, Bosnia and Herzegovina specifically commits itself:    To reducing chlorofluorocarbon consumption to no greater than:    Zero ODP-tonnes in 2009;   Zero ODP-tonnes in 2010, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To monitoring its system for licensing the import and export of ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances, including import quotas;     To urge Bosnia and Herzegovina to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement its plan of action to phase out consumption of chlorofluorocarbons;    To monitor closely the progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons. To the degree that the Party is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Bosnia and Herzegovina should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance;    To caution Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance, that, in the event that it fails to return to compliance, the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article\xc2\xa04, such as ensuring that the supply of chlorofluorocarbons that are the subject of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance is ceased so that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance;
