The Bureau commended the Minister for Science, Research and Culture of the Land Brandenburg for the detailed report on the state of conservation of the site and the actions that have been taken to preserve the Potsdam cultural landscape. \n The Bureau particularly welcomed the openness of the German authorities for dialogue and their commitment to seek compromise solutions. In particular, the Bureau took note of the commitments of the German authorities to: \n -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proceed with the extension of the World Heritage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; site as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recommended by the World Heritage Committee &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at its &nbsp;&nbsp; twentieth session; \n -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initiate the preparation of a comprehensive \'Urban &nbsp; Development Master Plan for the Development of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potsdam Cultural Landscape\'; \n -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch three architectural/urban competitions for &nbsp;&nbsp; the  Quartier am Bahnhof, Alter Markt/Lustgarten and &nbsp; the Alter Markt/Palais Barberini . \n -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cancel previous plans for the hotel in the  Quartier am &nbsp; Bahnhof  building area number 2, so as to include &nbsp; this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; area in the architectural/urban competition; \n -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not to implement the results of the earlier competition &nbsp; for building areas 9-12 for any construction above the zero ground level until the competition for the entire &nbsp;  Quartier am Bahnhof  will be completed and thus to allow for the competitors to develop their proposals for the &nbsp;&nbsp; entire site and for the German authorities to review the &nbsp;&nbsp; plans for building areas 9-12 in the light of their compatibility with the results of the competition and the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feasibility of the project. \n Furthermore, the Bureau noted with satisfaction that the \'German Unity Transport Project No 17\' will not have any negative impact on the World Heritage site and that no dredging along the river sides of the castle park of Babelsberg, Neuen Garten and castle parks of Glienicke and Sacrow will be undertaken and that the Glienicke Bridge will not be changed. \n Having examined in detail the report provided by the Minister for Science, Research and Culture of Land Brandenburg, the Bureau requested the German authorities to provide by 15 October 1997 a report for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its twenty-first session which should address in particular: \n -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the progress made in the preparation of the proposal for the extension of the World Heritage site; \n -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the progress made in the preparation of a comprehensive &nbsp; \'Urban Development Master Plan for the Development of the &nbsp; Potsdam Cultural Landscape\'; \n -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the results of the architectural/urban competitions for &nbsp; the  Quartier am Bahnhof, Alter Markt/Lustgarten and the Alter Markt/Palais Barberini ; \n -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an assessment of the impact of individual building &nbsp; projects, as mentioned in the report submitted by the &nbsp; German authorities as well as other projects, on the values of the Potsdam cultural landscape; \n -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the results of the impact assessment of the \'German Unity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transport Project No 17\'. \n The Bureau recommended that, on the basis of this new report, the Committee during its twenty-first session, examines if the threats to the World Heritage site still persist and if it still considers it necessary to inscribe the World Heritage site of Potsdam on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
