The  Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVII/12:     Noting  that Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol continue to report production of chlorofluorocarbons to meet the basic domestic needs of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol, pursuant to Article 2A of the Protocol,    Recalling  that the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel reported to the Parties in its 2004 Basic Domestic Needs Task Force Report that there is no evidence of chlorofluorocarbon supply shortage in recent years and that the bulk market price for chlorofluorocarbons in Parties operating under Article 5 of the Protocol is not rising, a situation that may be impeding the market penetration of chlorofluorocarbon alternatives in those countries,    Also noting  the phase-out schedule for production of chlorofluorocarbons to meet the basic domestic needs of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 by 2010 as set out in Article 2A of the Protocol,    Recognizing  the successful efforts of several Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 to phase out their chlorofluorocarbon production with assistance from the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol,    Recognizing  the successful efforts of several Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 in phasing out production of chlorofluorocarbons for basic domestic needs,    Mindful  of the requirement set out in decision V/25 for Parties supplying the basic domestic needs of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 to report such quantities and secure and report affirmations from receiving Parties, and of decision VII/9 on basic domestic needs,    Noting  that sufficient supplies of chlorofluorocarbons are available from production facilities in Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and from recycled and reclaimed stocks,    Seeking  to phase out chlorofluorocarbon production as soon as possible,     To urge all Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 that produce chlorofluorocarbons to meet the basic domestic needs of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 to ensure that such production is truly required by:     Requesting a written affirmation from the prospective importing Party that the chlorofluorocarbons are required and that such importation would not result in its non-compliance, prior to exporting any chlorofluorocarbons to meet the basic domestic needs of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5;   Including copies of these written affirmations when reporting chlorofluorocarbon production to meet the basic domestic needs of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 to the Ozone Secretariat under Article 7 of the Protocol;     To request that the Secretariat report at the next Meeting of the Parties and at each regular Meeting of the Parties thereafter, the level of production of chlorofluorocarbons in Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 to meet the basic domestic needs of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 as compared to their allowed production as set out in Article 2A of the Protocol and when doing so to include copies of the affirmations, together with available data on transfer of production rights;   To urge all Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 that have an entitlement to produce chlorofluorocarbons for the basic domestic needs of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 to ensure an accelerated phase-out of their production, and to report back to the Parties at their Eighteenth Meeting on progress in eliminating production of chlorofluorocarbons for basic domestic needs;   To consider at the Eighteenth Meeting of the Parties an adjustment to accelerate the phase-out schedule set out in Article 2A of the Protocol for chlorofluorocarbon production to meet the basic domestic needs of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5.
