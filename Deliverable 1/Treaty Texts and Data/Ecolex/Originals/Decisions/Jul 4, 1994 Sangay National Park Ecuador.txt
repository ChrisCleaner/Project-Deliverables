The Bureau recalled that the site was inscribed in 1983 and added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1992 due to threats from poaching and a road construction. A field mission was carried out in 1993 and a report was submitted to the seventeenth session of the World Heritage Committee in December 1993. A short up-date report has been provided by the IUCN Office in Ecuador, indicating major restructuring of the park administration and a reduction of personnel. Furthermore, the Macas-Guamote road construction is progressing with no attention being paid to the conditions of the inter-institutional agreement. The Bureau decided to request the Centre to prepare two letters, one to be signed by the Director-General of UNESCO and the other by the Chairperson of the World Heritage Committee, addressed to the Government of Ecuador, expressing the Bureau\'s above concerns.
