Property:  Central Sikhote-Alin  \n Id. N&deg;:  766 Rev  \n State Party:  Russian Federation    \n Criteria:  N (iv)  \n The Committee inscribed Central Sikhote-Alin on the World Heritage List under criterion (iv): \n Criterion (iv):   The nominated area is representative of one of the world\'s most distinctive natural regions. The combination of glacial history, climate and relief has allowed the development of the richest and most unusual temperate forests in the world. Compared to other temperate ecosystems, the level of endemic plants and invertebrates present in the region is extraordinarily high which has resulted in unusual assemblages of plants and animals. For example, subtropical species such as tiger and Himalayan bear share the same habitat with species typical of northern taiga such as brown bear and reindeer. The site is also important for the survival of endangered species such as the scaly-sided (Chinese) merganser, Blakiston\'s fish-owl and the Amur tiger. \n This serial nomination consists of two protected areas in the Sikhote-Alin mountain range in the extreme southeast of the Russian Federation:&nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n  Name   \n \n \n  Location   \n \n \n \n \n Sikhote-Alin Nature Preserve \n \n \n Terney district \n \n \n \n \n Goralij Zoological Preserve \n \n \n Coastal zone on the Sea of Japan, N of Terney \n \n \n \n \n The Committee encouraged the State Party to improve management of the Bikin River protected areas (Bikin Territory of Traditional Nature Use and Verkhnebikinski zakaznik) before nominating it as an extension. \n &nbsp;
