St. Kilda  \n  387  \n  United Kingdom  \n  N(iii)(iv)  \n The Committee was informed of the proposals to expand the radio tracking facilities on Hirta Island and was satisfied with the decision of the Secretary of State for Scotland, acting in concertation with local nature conservation authorities, to take appropriate measures concerning the siting, size, and colouring of these facilities which would minimise their impact on the nature conservation values. Given the high value of the marine area surrounding the archipelago of St. Kilda, any proposal in the future by the authorities of the United Kingdom to extend the nominated area would be welcomed by the Committee. \n &nbsp;
