Noting  the evaluation and recommendation of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Chemicals Technical Options Committee on the essential-use nomination for chlorofluorocarbon\xe2\x80\x91113 for aerospace applications,    Noting also  that the Russian Federation continues to explore the possibility of importing chlorofluorocarbon\xe2\x80\x91113 for its aerospace industry needs from available global stocks,    Noting further  that the Russian Federation has been successful in reducing use and emissions in line with the technical adaptation timetable developed in collaboration with the Chemicals Technical Options Committee,   1. To authorize the levels of production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbon\xe2\x80\x91113 in the Russian Federation for essential-use exemptions for chlorofluorocarbons in its aerospace industry in the amount of 85 metric tonnes in 2014;   2. To request the Russian Federation to explore further the possibility of importing chlorofluorocarbon\xe2\x80\x91113 for its aerospace industry needs from available global stocks;   3. To encourage the Russian Federation to continue its efforts to introduce alternative solvents and adopt newly designed equipment, with a view to completing the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbon\xe2\x80\x91113 by 2016;
