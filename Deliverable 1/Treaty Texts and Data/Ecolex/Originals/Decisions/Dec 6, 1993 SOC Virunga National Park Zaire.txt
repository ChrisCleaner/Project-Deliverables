Virunga   National Park (Zaire)  \n IUCN reported on the difficult social and economic situation which is creating serious negative impacts on Virunga National Park. However, the emergency assistance project funded by the World Heritage Fund and carried out by WWF since its approval by the Bureau in June 1993, had positive effects for the protection of the site. The Committee discussed in detail the impact of listing the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger and IUCN confirmed that Virunga National Park would definitely be a candidate for this procedure. After considerable discussion and a vote, the Committee agreed to address a letter to the Zairois authorities underlining serious concern for the protection and management of the site, particularly the serious recurring encroachments, and suggesting to the Government of Zaire to consider preparing a technical assistance request. \n &nbsp;
