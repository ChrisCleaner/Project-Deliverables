The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.&nbsp; Having examined  Document WHC-10/34.COM/7A.Add, \n 2.&nbsp; Recalling  Decision  33 COM 7A.9 , adopted at its 33rd session (Sevilla, 2009), \n 3.&nbsp; Commends  the State Party for the progress made in the implementation of the corrective measures adopted by the World Heritage Committee at its 30th session (Vilnius, 2006) but  notes  the assessment by the 2009 UNESCO/IUCN mission that their implementation has not yet been completed; \n 4.&nbsp; Also notes  that the two main threats to the Outstanding Universal Value, namely uncontrolled grazing and agricultural encroachment in the property, have not yet been effectively addressed; \n 5.&nbsp; Acknowledges  the strategies developed by the State Party to address these threats but expresses its concern that so far no funding has been identified for their implementation of these strategies; \n 6.&nbsp; Reiterates its request  to the State Party to organize as soon as possible the donor conference for which funding has been provided from the World Heritage Fund in order to identify potential donors, as a first step for possible removal of the property from the List of World Heritage in Danger in the near future, and  calls upon  the international community to financially support the implementation of the grazing management and alternative livelihoods strategies; \n 7.&nbsp; Considers  that the indicators, that describe the Desired State of Conservation and measure the restoration of the values and ecological integrity of the property, as established by the 2009 monitoring mission, should be reached to enable the removal of the property from the List of World Heritage in Danger; \n 8.&nbsp; Urges  the State Party to continue its efforts to implement the three remaining unmet corrective measures by prioritizing the following actions, as detailed in the 2009 mission report: \n a) Boundary gazetting: improve the on-the-ground demarcation of the property and finalize its gazetting into national law; \n b) Livestock reduction: review the Grazing Pressure Reduction Strategy to identify priorities and partners and funding for its implementation; \n c) Alternative livelihoods: identify and implement the lessons learned from the recent successful voluntary relocation of 165 households from the village of Arkwasiye, and seek support from development NGO, donors and the government for the provision of alternative livelihoods; \n 9.&nbsp; Recommends  to the State Party to implement the other recommendations of the 2009 mission on management planning, tourism planning and management, road and power supply alignments and climate change adaptation; \n 10.&nbsp; Requests  the State Party to submit the proposed extension of the property through the preparation of a new nomination,  considers  that the documentation would not need to be as extensive as a nomination for a new property, and  invites  the State Party to apply for International Assistance to support this process; \n 11.&nbsp; Further requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2011 , a report on the state of conservation of the property, in particular on progress accomplished in the implementation of corrective measures and the other recommendations of the 2009 mission, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 35th session in 2011 in view of removing the property from the List of World Heritage in Danger in the near future. \n  12.&nbsp; Decides  to retain Simien Mountains National Park (Ethiopia) on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
