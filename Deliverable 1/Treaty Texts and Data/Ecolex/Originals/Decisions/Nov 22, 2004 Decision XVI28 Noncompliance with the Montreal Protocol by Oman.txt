The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/28:      To note that Oman has reported annual data for the controlled substance in Annex B, group III (methyl chloroform), for 2003 which are above its requirements for that substance. As a consequence, for 2003, Oman was in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2E of the Montreal Protocol;   To note that, in response to a request from the Implementation Committee for an explanation for its excess consumption and a plan of action to return it to compliance, Oman has introduced a ban on the import of methyl chloroform;   That no action is required on this incident of non-compliance, but that Oman should ensure that a similar case does not occur again.
