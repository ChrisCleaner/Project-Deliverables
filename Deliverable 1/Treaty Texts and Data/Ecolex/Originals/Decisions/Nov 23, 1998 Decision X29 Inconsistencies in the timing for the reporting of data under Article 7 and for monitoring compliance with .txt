The  Tenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. X/29:      Noting  that the compliance period for Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol for the freeze in production and consumption extends from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, and from 1 July 2001 to 31 December 2002 under paragraph 8  bis  of Article 5,     Noting also  that the process of collecting accurate data on anything other than a calendar year basis is very difficult,     Noting further  that Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 faced similar difficulties, which were overcome when it became clear that their reductions in production and consumption were significantly below those required under the freeze obligations of Article 2A,     To urge the Implementation Committee to review and report on the status of the data reported by Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5, relative to the freeze in production and consumption using the best available data submitted;   To urge the Implementation Committee to view the data from the July to June time period, or other time periods relevant to paragraph 8  bis  of Article 5, as especially critical in cases where annual data submitted by Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 demonstrates that a country is very close to its baseline freeze level.
