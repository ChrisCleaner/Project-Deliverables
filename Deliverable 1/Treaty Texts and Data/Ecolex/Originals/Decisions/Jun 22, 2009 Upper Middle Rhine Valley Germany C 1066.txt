The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-09/33.COM/7B.Add, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  32 COM 7B.93 , adopted at its 32nd session (Quebec   City, 2008), \n 3.  Notes  the summary version of the Environmental Impact Study of the Rhine crossing options and the traffic analysis provided by the State Party and that an architectural competition has taken place for the proposed bridge; \n 4.  Regrets  that the full version of the Environmental Impact Study was not submitted on time; \n 5.  Considers  that the summary version of the Environmental Impact Study fails to set out an adequate methodology to interrogate the impact of the proposed bridge on the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n 6.  Further requests  the State Party in consultation with the World Heritage Centre and the Advisory Bodies to develop a draft Statement of Outstanding Universal Value for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010; \n 7. In order that the recommendations of the 2008 World Heritage Centre/ICOMOS advisory mission be fully considered in terms of the potential impacts of a proposed crossing on the Outstanding Universal Value and integrity of the property, including on important views,  requests  ICOMOS to consider the complete Environmental Impact Study to allow for a full assessment of the proposed bridge, tunnel and other solutions on the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, and defer any further action until these alternatives have been evaluated; \n 8.  Further requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre by  1 February 2010  a report on progress in the decision making on the Rhine crossing for review by the World Heritage Centre and the Advisory Bodies, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010.
