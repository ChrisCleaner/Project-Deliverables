The  Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVII/14:     Acknowledging  that Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol have phased out chlorofluorocarbons but under specific conditions, can apply for essential-use exemption for the consumption of chlorofluorocarbons in the manufacture of metered-dose inhalers as specified by the Meeting of the Parties,    Concerned  that Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol which consume chlorofluorocarbons for the manufacture of metered-dose inhalers may find it difficult to phase out these substances without incurring economic losses to their countries,    Calling upon  the parent pharmaceutical companies to accelerate the transfer of non-chlorofluorocarbon technologies to their joint venture partners in developing countries,    Noting  the need for further work to be undertaken to assemble and document the new non-ozone-depleting substances methods of technology for metered-dose inhalers that would allow elimination of further uses of chlorofluorocarbons,    Noting with concern  that there is a serious risk that, for some Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5, consumption levels in 2007 of chlorofluorocarbons for metered-dose inhaler uses may exceed the allowable amounts,    Aware  of the critical need by Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 for the consumption of metered-dose inhalers for protecting human health,    Recognizing  also the difficulties that may be faced by Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 in obtaining sufficient supply of Annex A, group I (chlorofluorocarbons) controlled substances during the period 2007-2009,     To consider at the Eighteenth Meeting of the Parties a possible decision which would address the difficulties that some Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 may face in relation to metered-dose inhalers;   To request the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund to examine situations such as these and consider options that might assist this potential situation of non-compliance;   To request the Executive Committee to consider appropriate regional workshops to create awareness and educate stakeholders, including doctors and patients, on alternative metered-dose inhalers and on the elimination of chlorofluorocarbons in metered-dose inhaler uses and technical assistance to Article 5 Parties to phase out this use;   To request the Open-ended Working Group at its twenty-sixth meeting to consider the issue.
