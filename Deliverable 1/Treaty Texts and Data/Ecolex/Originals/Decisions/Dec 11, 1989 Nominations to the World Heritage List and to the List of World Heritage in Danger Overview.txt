44. The Committee examined 18 nominations of cultural and natural properties to the World Heritage List. It decided to inscribe seven properties and extend one property (Section A), to defer the examination of two properties (Section B), and not to inscribe eight properties (Section C). In addition, the Committee inscribed one property on the List of World Heritage in Danger and withdrew another property from this List (Section D). \n 45. The Committee was informed by the Secretariat that by a letter dated 6 November 1989, the Federal Republic of Germany had withdrawn the nomination of the Wattenmeer (Mudflats of Lower Saxony). The German authorities had decided to follow the recommendation of the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee and prepare a fully documented nomination of the whole Wadden Sea, to be jointly submitted by Denmark, the Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Committee welcomed this initiative and requested the Secretariat to follow up this matter, in particular to continue its contacts with the Dutch authorities to encourage the adherence of the Netherlands to the Convention. \n 46. One State Party informed the Committee that the nomination of a cultural property in his country had been withdrawn. \n &nbsp;
