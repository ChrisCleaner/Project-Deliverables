The Bureau was informed of the decision of the National Institute for Culture to suspend the plans to construct two suspended cable car systems to facilitate access to the ruins of Machu Picchu. The Bureau suggested that the alternative means of access to Machu Picchu be studied in the context of integral planning for the whole of the area of the Sanctuary and that an assessment of its impact be undertaken. The Bureau requested the authorities of Peru to inform the Committee on the progress made in the development of an integral management mechanism as well as on the plans for the access to the ruins of Machu Picchu.
