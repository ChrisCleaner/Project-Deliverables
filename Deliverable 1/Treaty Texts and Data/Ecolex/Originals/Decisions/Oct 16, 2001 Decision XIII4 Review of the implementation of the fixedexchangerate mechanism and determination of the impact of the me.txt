The  Thirteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XIII/4:    Noting the interim report jointly prepared by the Treasurer and the Secretariat of the Multilateral Fund on the implementation of the fixed-exchange-rate mechanism in response to decision XI/6,    Noting  that due to lack of time the report lacks information on a number of areas which the delegates raised at the 21st Meeting of the Open-ended Working Group, in particular the reviewing of the impact of purchasing power and the experience gained with fixed-exchange-rate mechanisms in other similar institutions,    With the view  that the possible impact of the fixed-exchange-rate mechanism should be balanced,     To request the Treasurer and the Secretariat of the Multilateral Fund to finalize the review, as per decision XI/6, and give a final report to the Parties at the 22 nd  Meeting of the Open-ended Working Group; and   That in so doing, the Secretariat should:     Consult, as appropriate, other relevant multilateral funding institutions that use a fixed-exchange-rate mechanism, or similar mechanisms;   Identify options on how a fixed-exchange-rate mechanism could be implemented so that the process of phasing out ozone-depleting substances is not adversely affected, and hire consultants for that purpose, as appropriate.
