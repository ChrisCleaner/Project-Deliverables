Historic District of the Town of Panama with the Salon Bolivar  \n  790  \n  Panama  \n  C(ii)(iv)(vi)   \n The Committee decided to inscribe this property on the basis of cultural criteria (ii), (iv) and (vi), considering that Panam&aacute; was the first European settlement on the Pacific coast of the Americas, in 1519, and the Historic District preserves intact a street pattern, together with a substantial number of early domestic buildings, which are exceptional testimony to the nature of this early settlement. The Sal&oacute;n Bolivar is of outstanding historical importance, as the venue for Sim&oacute;n Bolivar\'s visionary attempt in 1826 to create a Pan-American congress, more than a century before such institutions became a reality. \n The Delegate of Thailand expressed his reservations on the application of criterion (vi). \n &nbsp;
