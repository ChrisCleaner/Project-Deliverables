Historical Centre of Lima (Peru)  \n The Committee took note of a report presented by the UNDP/UNESCO Project in which it was stated that the overall infrastructure presents a notorious state of degradation, although the monuments and landmarks, e.g. the Convent of San Francisco, are well maintained. \n The monitoring mission recommended that: \n - an integrated programme of rehabilitation and conservation for the historical centre should be set up, in which projects should be included for the re-adaptive use of historical structures, housing and infrastructure; \n - the technical assistance that was made available by the Committee in 1993 be used to organise an interdisciplinary workshop to design with the local authorities programmes of integral conservation and funding mechanisms. \n &nbsp;
