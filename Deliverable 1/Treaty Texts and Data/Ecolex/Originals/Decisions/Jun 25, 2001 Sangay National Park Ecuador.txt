V.28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau noted that following the recommendation of the Committee made at its last session (Cairns, Australia, November - December 2000), Sangay National Park has been included as one of the ten pilot sites in a UNESCO/IUCN/UNF-UNFIP Project entitled: "Enhancing our heritage: monitoring and managing for success in World Natural Heritage sites". The 4-year project financed at a total cost of US$ 2 million by UNF-UNFIP will elaborate and test a monitoring regime for Sangay National Park with indicators and benchmarks, including those that could signal the timing of the removal of the site from the List of World Heritage in Danger. This project will promote and assess implementation of the recommendations from the UNESCO/IUCN mission to this site.&nbsp; Project activities specific to Sangay and two other Latin American pilot sites will commence in the second half of 2001. The Bureau invited the Centre to submit a brief update on the progress achieved in initiating project activities in Sangay to the twenty-fifth session of the Committee to be convened in Helsinki, Finland, in December 2001.
