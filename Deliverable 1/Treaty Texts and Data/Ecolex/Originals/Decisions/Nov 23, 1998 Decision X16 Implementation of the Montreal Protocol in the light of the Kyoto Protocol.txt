The  Tenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. X/16:     Noting  the need to implement multilateral environmental agreements in a coherent way for the benefit of the global environment,    Noting  that the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted the Kyoto Protocol to the Convention at its third meeting, held in Kyoto, from 1 to 11 December 1997,    Noting  that the Kyoto Protocol requires Parties listed in Annex I of the Framework Convention on Climate Change to ensure that their aggregate anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of the greenhouse gases listed in Annex A of that Protocol do not exceed their assigned amounts as listed in Annex B during the first commitment period of 2008-2012,    Noting further  that the greenhouse gases included in Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol include hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) in view of their high global warming potentials,    Noting  that the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel has identified HFCs and PFCs as alternatives to ozone-depleting substances, and some Parties and enterprises have already changed over, and others are changing over, to such HFC and PFC technologies, and    Noting with appreciation  that the Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change at its fourth meeting adopted a decision on the relationship between efforts to protect the stratospheric ozone layer and efforts to safeguard the global climate system, in particular with reference to HFCs and PFCs,   To request, with a view in particular to assisting the Parties to the Montreal Protocol to assess the implications for the implementation of the Montreal Protocol of the inclusion of HFCs and PFCs in the Kyoto Protocol, the relevant Montreal Protocol bodies, within their areas of competence:     To provide relevant information on HFCs and PFCs to the Secretariat of the Framework Convention on Climate Change by 15 July 1999 in accordance with operative paragraph 1 of the above-mentioned decision;   To convene a workshop with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which will assist the bodies of the Framework Convention on Climate Change to establish information on available and potential ways and means of limiting emissions of HFCs and PFCs in accordance with operative paragraph 2 of the above-mentioned decision;   To continue to develop information on the full range of existing and potential alternatives to ozone depleting substances for specific uses, including alternatives not listed in Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol;   To otherwise continue to cooperate with the relevant bodies under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and IPCC on these matters; and   To report to the Open Ended Working Group at its nineteenth meeting and to the Eleventh Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on this work.
