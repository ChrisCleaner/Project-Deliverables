The  Second Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. II/12  to agree with the recommendations adopted by the Customs Co-operation Council that all member administrations take actions to reflect the adopted subheadings in their national statistical nomenclatures as soon as possible, and to ask the Secretariat to inform the Council that the Parties, having determined that additional subheadings for individual chemicals controlled by the Montreal Protocol would be useful in their efforts to protect the ozone layer, request the assistance of the Council in this regard.
