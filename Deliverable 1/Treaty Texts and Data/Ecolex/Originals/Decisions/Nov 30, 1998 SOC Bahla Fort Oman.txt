VII.18 Bahla Fort (Oman)  \n Following previous expert missions, a third mission took place in September 1998 to assess the quality of the restoration works in terms of authenticity and use of materials, advise on future works and particularly on the preparation of a management plan for an extended area, including the Fort and the oasis, as well as on the hydro-graphic survey that should be urgently undertaken. \n The mission reported that photogrammetric works were due to begin, facilitating therefore the restoration of the Fort. It recommended, among other things, that the conservation plan be completed including planning of archaeological works. \n Finally, considering that the situation in the site has improved in a sensible manner, the mission discussed with the authorities the possibility of reinforcing the cost-sharing approach used so far. It submitted to the authorities a draft proposal and the Centre was awaiting a reply on this proposal. \n The Committee commended the Government of Oman for the actions taken for the preservation of the Fort. It requested the Secretariat to collaborate with the national authorities in the preparation of a five-year conservation plan for the entire oasis, for examination by the Committee at its twenty-third session. \n The Committee decided to retain the Bahla Fort on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
