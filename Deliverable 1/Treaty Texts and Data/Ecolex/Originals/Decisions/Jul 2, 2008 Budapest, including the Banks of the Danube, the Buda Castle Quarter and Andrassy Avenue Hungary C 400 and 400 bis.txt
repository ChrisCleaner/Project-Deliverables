The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-08/32.COM/7B , \n 2.  Recalling  Decisions  26 COM 23.10/11/12  and  27 COM 8C.2,  adopted at its 26th (Budapest, 2002) and 27th (UNESCO, 2003) sessions respectively, \n 3.  Expresses its utmost concern  regarding the ongoing demolition of old buildings of great architectural and urban quality in the buffer zone of the inscribed property, particularly in the "Jewish quarter"; \n 4.  Also expresses its grave concern  regarding the reconstruction, in their place, of contemporary buildings of questionable quality that profoundly transform the architectural and urban value of this quarter; \n 5.  Requests  the State Party to act, without delay, to: \n a) re-examine, case by case, the demolition permits already granted with a view to equity with the holders of permits already granted, but giving priority to the conservation of the existing built heritage; \n b) consider establishing an urban conservation and development plan for the buffer zone, fully respecting the principal architectural and urban values of each quarter, and for which enforcement would be stricter than it is at present in each quarter; \n c) seek additional funding (for example tax incentives, grants) and in a dynamic manner, direct private building investment to rehabilitation operations and restoration rather than demolition and reconstruction; \n 6.  Also requests  the State Party to undertake archaeological work to identify the physical traces of the ancient ghetto and to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2009,  a detailed report on the urban situation in the "Jewish quarter" and on conservation measures in force.
