In connection with discussions on the state of conservation of several World Heritage sites, the Bureau emphasized the need for the recognition of the World Heritage values in the integral planning at World Heritage sites, as well as the need for the establishment of adequate buffer zones. It also concluded that communications between all levels of government and the World Heritage Committee and its Secretariat should be improved so as to avoid that the World Heritage Committee be alerted too late in the process about inappropriate interventions and constructions in or close to World Heritage sites. The Representative of IUCN also commended the importance given in the Hadrian\'s Wall Management Plan to the site\'s World Heritage status and drew the Bureau\'s attention to the excellent emphasis on World Heritage in the planning ordinances for the City of Bath.
