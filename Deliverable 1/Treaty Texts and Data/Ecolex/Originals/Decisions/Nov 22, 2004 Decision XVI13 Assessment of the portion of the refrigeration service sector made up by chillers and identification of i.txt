The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/13:     Noting  with appreciation the report of the chiller task force on the collection of data and assessment of the portion of the refrigeration service sector made up by chillers, as decided in decision XIV/9,    Noting  that the chiller sector has been and will be a long-term challenge for both developed and developing countries owing to its distinct character, as has been brought out by the report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel,    Recognizing  the need to develop a management plan for CFC-based chillers in the Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5, to facilitate CFC phase-out in chillers,    Recognizing  also the urgent need for effective replacement programmes to phase out consumption of CFCs,    Recognizing  further the need for economic incentives for assisting enterprises in these countries to speed up the replacement programme,    Recognizing  the impediments and uncertainties brought out by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel in its report related to the lack of information for decision makers and lack of policies and regulatory measures needed to be set up for CFC phase-out in the chiller sector,   To request the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund to consider:     Funding of additional demonstration projects to help demonstrate the value of replacement of CFC-based chillers, pursuant to relevant decisions of the Executive Committee;   Funding actions to increase awareness of users in countries operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the impending phase-out and options that may be available for dealing with their chillers and to assist Governments and decision makers;   Requesting those countries preparing or implementing refrigerant management plans to consider developing measures for the effective use of the ozone-depleting substances recovered from the chillers to meet servicing needs in the sector.
