The Bureau recalled that the site was included on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1992 because of negative impacts from a proposed iron-ore mining project and threats due to the arrival of a large number of refugees from neighbouring countries. \n The Bureau took note of a Round Table on Mount Nimba which was held in Conakry (Guinea) on 17 and 18 April 1996 organized by the Ministry for Energy and Environment in collaboration with the "Mission Fran&ccedil;aise de Cooperation et d\'Action Culturelle". The Round Table included representatives of the following donor countries and organizations: France, Germany, Japan, Canada, the Wallonian Region of Belgium, The World Bank, UNDP, the European Union, and USAID. The Bureau took note of the recommendation that UNESCO considers supporting the establishment of a working group to create an "International Foundation for Mount Nimba". \n The Bureau commended the States Parties for their efforts. However, given the uncertainties concerning the adequate management of the site, and the shortcomings with regard to the on-site management, the Bureau recommended to the Committee to retain the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
