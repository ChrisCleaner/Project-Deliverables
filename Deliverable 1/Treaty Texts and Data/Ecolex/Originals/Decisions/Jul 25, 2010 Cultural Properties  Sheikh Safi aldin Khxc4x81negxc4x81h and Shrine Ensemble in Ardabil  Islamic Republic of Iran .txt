The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Documents WHC-10/34.COM/8B and WHC-10/34.COM/INF.8B1, \n 2.  Inscribes  the  Sheikh Safi al-din Kh\xc4\x81neg\xc4\x81h and Shrine Ensemble in Ardabil, Islamic Republic of Iran,   on the World Heritage List on the basis of criteria  (i), (ii),   and  (iv)  ; \n 3.  Adopts  the following Statement of Outstanding Universal Value: \n Brief synthesis \n Sheikh Safi al-Din Kh\xc4\x81neg\xc4\x81h and Shrine Ensemble was built as a small microcosmic city with bazaars, public baths, squares, religious buildings, houses, and offices. It was the largest and most complete kh\xc4\x81neg\xc4\x81h and the most prominent Sufi shrine since it also hosts the tomb of the founder of the Safavid Dynasty. For these reasons, it has evolved into a display of sacred works of art and architecture from the 14th to the 18th century and a centre of Sufi religious pilgrimage. \n The Sheikh Safi al-Din Kh\xc4\x81neg\xc4\x81h and Shrine Ensemble in Ardabil is of Outstanding Universal Value as an artistic and architectural masterpiece and an outstanding representation of the fundamental principles of Sufism. Ilkhanid and Timurid architectural languages, influenced by Sufi philosophy, have created new spatial forms and decorative patterns. The layout of the ensemble became a prototype for innovative architectural expressions and a reference for other kh\xc4\x81neg\xc4\x81hs. As the shrine of a prominent Sufi master, who also was the founder of the Safavid Dynasty, the property has remained sacred in Iran up to the present day. \n  Criterion (i):  The conception of the entire ensemble layout, the proportions of the internal and external spaces and of the buildings, their design and refined decoration, together with the climax created by the sequenced path to Sheikh Safi al-Din\'s shrine, all combined, have concurred to create a unique complex in which aesthetics and spirituality are in a harmonious dialogue. \n  Criterion (ii):  The architectural spaces and features of the nominated property have integrated influences of the Ilkh\xc4\x81nid and Timurid periods with the religious message of Sufism and the taste for exquisite ornamentation and interior spaciousness, thus giving rise to fresh architectural and artistic forms. \n  Criterion (iv):   The Sheikh Safi al-Din ensemble is a prototype and an outstanding example of a 16th century religious complex, combined with social, charitable, cultural, and educational functions, which contains all the significant elements that&nbsp; since came to characterize Safavid architecture and became a prototype for other kh\xc4\x81neg\xc4\x81h and shrines. \n Integrity and Authenticity \n The property contains all the elements that convey its Outstanding Universal Value. Most of the elements of the property are in good condition and, despite several transformations, the site continues to present an image of harmonious composition, in which the material realization of the spiritual path through the architectural design is still clearly legible. The State Party has taken steps to restore the original access to the ensemble, which will strengthen the connection between the architecture and the Sufi spiritual messages. \n The design form of the entire complex and of individual buildings has been retained and their religious functions have been maintained in most cases. Where they have changed, the new uses are appropriate to the architectural structure in general, and the material and technical authenticity has been retained, as well as the spiritual character of the place. It is, however, important to reduce the tendency to go too far in conservation work. \n Protection and management requirements \n The nominated property has been protected under the Iranian legislation since 1932. According to the law currently in force, special protection provisions are in place for the property, the buffer zone and for a wider area called the \'landscape zone.\' These provisions, already in place, are also being incorporated into the revised Master Plan for Ardabil, final approval of which is scheduled for September 2010. \n Any project concerning protected monuments in Iran must be in accordance with the provisions of the law and must be approved by ICHHTO, the authority in charge of the protection of Iranian monuments. The management framework established for the nominated property integrates the regulations for Sheikh Safi al-Din Kh\xc4\x81neg\xc4\x81h and Shrine Ensemble and the provisions of the Ardabil Master Plan. \n Management of protected monuments is the responsibility of the High Technical Council of ICHHTO, which approves budgets and all major conservation works. Minor works and day-to-day maintenance is ensured by a steering committee which can avail itself of a multidisciplinary team (the ICHHTO Sheikh Safi al-Din Ensemble Base), which is headed by a urban planner and includes on its staff engineers, architects, conservation architects, and archaeologists. \n 4.  Recommends  that the State Party: \n a) Respect the programmed schedule to finalise the approval of the revised Ardabil Master Plan and provide the World Heritage Centre with updated and detailed information with maps, zoning and regulations of the revised Ardabil City Master Plan when it will receive final approval in September 2010; \n b) Establish a detailed time frame for short, medium and long-term objectives for the management system; \n c) Pay specific attention to exposed archaeological remains; \n d) Adopt adequate conservation measures for Chini Khana and Shah Ismail\'s mother\'s grave as soon as possible; \n e) Give maximum consideration to all alternatives that may ensure the correct interpretation and communication of the value of the nominated property, while keeping reconstruction as a last option; \n f) Continue the efforts undertaken to finalise a comprehensive visitor strategy and plan, as soon as possible, and incorporate them into the revised Ardabil Master Plan; \n g) Develop a risk preparedness plan with specific regard to seismic threat; \n h) Implement the envisioned comprehensive monitoring system as soon as possible and develop systematic applied technical research on the nominated property for monitoring purposes; \n i) Proceed with the plans to re-establish the original access to the Shrine and provide the World Heritage Centre with detailed information on any progress made.
