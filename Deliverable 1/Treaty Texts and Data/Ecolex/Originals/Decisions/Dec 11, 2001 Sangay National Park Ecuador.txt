VIII.29  The Committee noted with interest the inclusion of Sangay as one of the Latin American pilot sites in the UN Foundation financed pilot project entitled: "Enhancing our heritage: monitoring and managing for success in World Natural Heritage sites". The project will test out monitoring and management effectiveness evaluation tools developed by an IUCN/WCPA Task Force. The project management in co-operation with IUCN, both in Gland and in Latin America, is discussing the details for the organization of a national workshop where the development of indicators and benchmarks to monitor changes in the state of conservation of the site and linking their monitoring to the timing of the possible removal of the site from the List of World Heritage in Danger will be discussed. IUCN noted that there may be potential for removing this site from the Danger List. The Committee invited the Centre and IUCN to submit a report on the outcome of that workshop to its twenty-sixth session in Hungary in June 2002 and submit regular progress reports on the execution of project activities to the subsequent annual sessions of the Committee. The Committee decided to retain the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
