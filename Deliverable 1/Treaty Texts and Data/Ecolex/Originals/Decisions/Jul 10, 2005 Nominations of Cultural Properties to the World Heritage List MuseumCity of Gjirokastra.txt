The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Having examined  Documents   WHC-05/29.COM/8B, WHC-05/29.COM/8B.Add 2   and   WHC-05/29.COM/INF.8B.1  ,  2.  Recalling  the decision adopted by the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee at its 15th session (UNESCO, 1991) and the report of the rapporteur SC-91/CONF.001/2,  3.  Inscribes  the  Museum-City of Gjirokastra  (Albania) on the World Heritage List on the basis of cultural criteria (iii) and (iv):   Criterion (iii):  The old city of Gjirokastra is an exceptional testimony to a long-lasting, and almost disappeared society and life-style, influenced by the culture and tradition of Islam in the Ottoman period.   Criterion (iv):  The historic town of Gjirokastra is a rare example of a wellpreserved Ottoman town, built by farmers of large estates, around the 13thcentury citadel. The architecture is characterized by the construction of a type of tower house (Turkish \xe2\x80\x98kule\'), of which Gjirokastra represents a series of outstanding examples.  4.  Requests  the State Party of Albania to draw up a detailed report on the conservation of the property, especially on the implementation of measures to counteract illegal construction and changes in the urban and landscape context.
