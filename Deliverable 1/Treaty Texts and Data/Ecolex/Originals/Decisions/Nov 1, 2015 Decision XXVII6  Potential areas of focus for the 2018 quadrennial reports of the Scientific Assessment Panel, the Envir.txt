1. To note with appreciation the excellent and highly useful work conducted by the Scientific Assessment Panel, the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel and the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel in preparing their 2014 quadrennial assessment reports, including the 2015 synthesis report;   2. To request the three assessment panels to prepare quadrennial assessment reports in 2018, to submit them to the Secretariat by 31 December 2018 for consideration by the Open-ended Working Group and by the Thirty-First Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in 2019 and to present a synthesis report by 30 April 2019, noting that the panels should continue to exchange information, including on all sectors, on alternatives and on the issue of high-ambient temperatures, during the process of developing their respective reports in order to provide comprehensive information to the parties to the Montreal Protocol;   3. To encourage the assessment panels to more closely involve relevant scientists from parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 with a view to promoting gender and regional balance, to the best of its ability, in the work of producing the reports;   4. To encourage the assessment panels to use defined, consistent units and consistent terminology throughout for better comparability;   5. To request the assessment panels to bring to the notice of the parties any significant developments which, in their opinion, deserve such notice, in accordance with decision IV/13;   6. To request the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel, in drafting its 2018 report, to consider the most recent scientific information regarding the effects on human health and the environment of changes in the ozone layer and in ultraviolet radiation, together with future projections and scenarios for those variables, taking into account those factors stipulated in Article 3 of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer;   7. To request the Scientific Assessment Panel to undertake, in its 2018 report, a review of the scientific knowledge as dictated by the needs of the parties to the Montreal Protocol, as called for in the terms of reference for the panels,  [3]   taking into account those factors stipulated in Article 3 of the Vienna Convention, including estimates of the levels of ozone-layer depletion attributed to the remaining potential emissions of ozone-depleting substances and an assessment of the level of global emissions of ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances below which the depletion of the ozone layer could be comparable to various other factors such as the natural variability of global ozone, its secular trend over a decadal timescale and the 1980 benchmark level;   8. To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, in its 2018 report, to consider the following topics, among others:   (a) The impact of the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances on sustainable development;   (b) Technical progress in the production and consumption sectors in the transition to alternatives and practices that eliminate or minimize emissions to the atmosphere of ozone-depleting substances, taking into account those factors stipulated in Article 3 of the Vienna Convention;   (c) Technically and economically feasible choices for the reduction and elimination of ozone-depleting substances in all relevant sectors, including through the use of alternatives, taking into account their performance, and technically and economically feasible alternatives to ozone-depleting substances in consumption sectors, taking into account their overall performance;   (d) The status of banks containing ozone-depleting substances and their alternatives, including those maintained for essential and critical uses, and the options available for handling them;   (e) Accounting for production and consumption for various applications and relevant sources of ozone-depleting substances and their alternatives;      [3] UNEP/OzL.Pro.1/5, annex VI.
