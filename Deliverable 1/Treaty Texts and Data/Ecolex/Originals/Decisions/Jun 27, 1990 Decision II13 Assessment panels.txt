The  Second Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. II/13  with regard to assessment panels:     to request the Technology Review Panel to assess, in accordance with Article 6, the earliest technically feasible dates and the costs for reductions and total phase-out of 1,1,1-trichloromethane (methyl chloroform) and to report its findings in time for consideration by the preparatory meeting to the Fourth Meeting of the Parties with a view to their consideration at that Fourth Meeting;   to request the Secretariat to convene members of each of the four assessment panels established by the First Meeting of the Parties to review new information and to consider its inclusion in supplementary reports in time for consideration by the Fourth Meeting of the Parties, subject to a review of their mandate in the context of Article 2, paragraph 9, at the Third Meeting of the Parties;   to request the Technology Review Panel to include in its work:     an evaluation of the need for transitional substances in specific applications;   an analysis of the quantity of controlled substances required by Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 for their basic domestic needs, both at present and in the future, and the likely availability of such supplies; and   a comparison of the toxicity, flammability, energy efficiency implications and other environmental and safety considerations of chemical substitutes, along with an analysis of the likely availability of substitutes for medical uses;     to request the Scientific Assessment Panel to include in its work:     an evaluation of the ozone-depletion potential, other possible ozone layer impacts, and global warming potential of chemical substitutes (e.g. HCFCs and HFCs) for controlled substances;   an evaluation of the likely ozone-depletion potential of \xe2\x80\x9cother halons\xe2\x80\x9d that might be produced in significant quantities; and   an analysis of the anticipated impact on the ozone layer of the revised control measures reflecting the changes adopted at the Second Meeting of the Parties taking into account the current level of global participation in the Protocol;     to instruct the Scientific Assessment Panel to prepare estimated data on the impacts on the ozone layer of engine emissions from high-altitude aircraft, heavy rockets and space shuttles;   to undertake efforts to encourage broad participation in all assessment panels by experts from developing countries.
