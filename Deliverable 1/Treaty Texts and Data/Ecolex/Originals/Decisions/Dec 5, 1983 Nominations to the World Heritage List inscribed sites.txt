The Committee furthermore recommended that to enhance the cultural and natural value of this property, the site should be extended to include the lower courses of the Urubamba River and the sites of Pisac and Ollantaytambo in the "Valley of the Gods". \n \n C(i)(iii) N(ii)(iii) \n \n \n Portugal \n 206 \n Central Zone of the Town of Angra do Heroismo (Azores) \n C(iv)(vi) \n \n \n Portugal \n 263 \n The monastery of the Hieronymites and the Tower of Belem (Lisbon) \n C(iii)(vi) \n \n \n Portugal \n 264 \n The monastery of Batalha \n C(i)(ii) \n \n \n Portugal \n 265 \n The convent of Christ (Tomar) \n C(i)(vi) \n \n \n Seychelles \n 261 \n Vall\xc3\xa9e de Mai Nature Reserve\n The Committee recommended that the Government of the Seychelles should extend this property to include the whole of Praslin National Park and that the management plan for the park (which encompasses the Vall\xc3\xa9e de Mai) be fully implemented. \n \n N(i)(ii)(iii)(iv) \n \n \n Switzerland \n 268 \n The Convent of St. Gall \n C(ii)(iv) \n \n \n Switzerland \n 269 \n The Benedictine Convent of St. John at Mustair \n C(iii) \n \n \n Switzerland \n 267 \n The Old City of Berne\n The Old City of Berne was inscribed on the World Heritage List.
