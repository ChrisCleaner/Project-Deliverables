IUCN and the Centre have been informed of a proposed cable car construction project through the centre of the Park. The feasibility of the project, proposed by a private individual concerned with tourism development, is questionable due to the heavy rains, high winds and steep terrain which characterise the site. The construction of major access facilities in this area is not consistent with the management plan of the Park. IUCN was advised by the Dominican authorities that they will exercise great caution when considering the feasibility of this proposal. \n The Bureau requested the Centre to contact the State Party to obtain detailed information on the proposal and requested that the Centre and IUCN be kept fully informed of progress in their review of the cable construction project proposal.
