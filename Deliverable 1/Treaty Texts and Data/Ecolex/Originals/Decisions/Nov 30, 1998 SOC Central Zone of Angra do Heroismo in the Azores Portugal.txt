VII.39 Central Zone of Angra do Heroismo in the Azores (Portugal)  \n The Bureau of the World Heritage Committee, at its twentysecond ordinary session, was informed about a marina project that seriously threatened the characteristic features of the waterfront of the World Heritage site. ICOMOS undertook a mission to the site in October 1998 and concluded that, although there is the economic need for a marina, it opposed this particular project for the negative impact it would have on the World Heritage values of the site. It recommended that an alternative location be sought for the marina. \n The Observer of Portugal stressed the need for a marina in Angra do Heroismo and that this marina would not affect the values of the site. He also informed about the actions taken with respect to the underwater heritage in the Bay of Angra de Heroismo. ICOMOS confirmed that this had been done according to the highest standards. \n The Committee expressed concerns and preoccupation about the location and impact of the marina on the World Heritage values of the site. While recognizing the economic need for a marina, it was of the opinion that this should be considered in the context of an overall conservation plan for the site. It encouraged the State Party to continue its dialogue with ICOMOS and the World Heritage Committee in order to find the best solution. It requested that the Committee be kept informed periodically on further developments in this matter. \n &nbsp;
