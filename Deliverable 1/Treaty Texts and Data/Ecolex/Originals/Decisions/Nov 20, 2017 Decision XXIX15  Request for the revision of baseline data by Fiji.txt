Noting  that, in decision XIII/15, the Thirteenth Meeting of the Parties decided to advise parties requesting changes in reported baseline data for the base years to present their requests before the Implementation Committee under the Non-Compliance Procedure for the Montreal Protocol, which in turn would work with the Secretariat and the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol to confirm the justification for the changes and present them to the Meeting of the Parties for approval,    Noting also  that decision XV/19 sets out the methodology for the submission of such requests,   1. That Fiji has presented sufficient information, in accordance with decision XV/19, to justify its request for the revision of its consumption data for hydrochlorofluorocarbons for the years 2009 and 2010, which are part of the baseline for parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5;   2. To approve the request by Fiji, and to revise its consumption data for hydrochlorofluorocarbons for the baseline years 2009 and 2010, as indicated in the following table:       \xc2\xa0    Previous hydrochlorofluorocarbon data (ODP-tonnes)     New hydrochlorofluorocarbon data (ODP-tonnes)         2009     2010     Baseline a      2009     2010     Baseline a         \xc2\xa0   7.6   9.2   8.4   5.00   6.46   5.73        a  Hydrochlorofluorocarbon baselines established after the Twenty-Third Meeting of the Parties are presented using two decimal places whereas those established before are presented using one decimal place (see decision XXIII/30).   3. To note that the change in baseline data confirmed that Fiji was in non-compliance with the control measures under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer for 2013 and 2014, but that as at 2015 the party had returned to compliance;   4. Also to note that no further action is needed in view of the return to compliance and the party\xe2\x80\x99s affirmation that it has taken the new baseline into account for 2015 and 2016;   5. To monitor closely progress by Fiji with regard to the phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and that, to the degree that the party is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a party in good standing;
