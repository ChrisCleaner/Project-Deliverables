The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-06/30.COM/7B ,  2.  Recalling  Decisions  28 COM 14B.5  and  29 COM 7B.9 , adopted at its 28th (Suzhou, 2004) and 29th (Durban, 2005) sessions respectively,  3.  Notes  with great concern the findings and recommendations of the joint IUCN-UNESCO monitoring mission (25 February to 5 March 2006), in particular that the property continues to be increasingly threatened by extensive agricultural encroachment, illegal logging, poaching, road construction and institutional and governance issues, and that an Emergency Action Plan requested at the time of inscription has not yet been prepared;  4.  Requests  the State Party to amend the boundaries of the World Heritage property to exclude major cleared encroachments and to add critical habitats for the conservation of biodiversity, as identified in the mission report;   5.  Further requests  the State Party to submit an Emergency Action Plan by  1February 2007 , for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 31st session in 2007, to address the trend in loss of value and integrity of the property. In this regard the State Party should:  a) Seek international assistance from the World Heritage Fund and the FFI-UNESCO-UNF World Heritage Rapid Response Facility, as well as technical support from IUCN and the World Heritage Centre, to urgently convene a workshop to scope the parameters of an Emergency Action Plan and identify partners, timeframe, responsibilities and sources of funding for its implementation, as well as benchmarks to assess progress over time;  b) Ensure that the Emergency Action Plan is developed in collaboration with national and international partners and consider a number of key interventions proposed by the monitoring mission to arrest the alarming on-going decline of the World Heritage property;   6.  Urges  the State Party, with support from UNESCO, IUCN and members of World Heritage Committee, to call for significant international donor support to implement the Emergency Action Plan and to develop capacity for effective long-term management and governance of the property;  7.  Requests  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre/IUCN mission to the property to assess the progress made in the implementation of the measures indicated in point 5 above, and report to the Committee at its 31st session in 2007;    Decides  that, if the above said results are not achieved by its 31st session in 2007, the property shall be inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger
