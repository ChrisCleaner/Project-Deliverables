The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/7:      To note that decision X/14 called on the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and the Executive Committee to review the list of process agent uses in table A of that decision, and to make appropriate recommendations for changes to the table;   To note that several Parties are submitting requests to have certain uses reviewed by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel for inclusion in table A of decision X/14 as process-agent uses;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to review requests for consideration of specific uses against decision X/14 criteria for process agents, and make recommendations to the Parties annually on uses that could be added to or removed from table A of decision X/14;   To remind Article 5 Parties and non-Article 5 Parties with process-agent applications listed in table A to decision X/14, as revised, that they shall report in accordance with paragraph 4 of decision X/14 on the use of controlled substances as process agents, the levels of emissions from those uses, and the containment technologies used by them to minimize emissions. In addition, Article 5 Parties with listed uses in table A, as revised, shall report to the Executive Committee on progress in reducing emissions of controlled substances from process-agent uses and on the implementation and development of emissions-reduction techniques and alternative processes not using ozone-depleting substances;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and the Executive Committee to report to the Open-ended Working Group at its twenty-fifth session, and every other year thereafter unless the Parties decide otherwise, on the progress made in reducing emissions of controlled substances from process-agent uses and on the implementation and development of emissions-reduction techniques and alternative processes not using ozone-depleting substances;   To note that, because the 2002 report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel lists the process-agent applications in the table below as having non-negligible emissions, those applications are to be considered process-agent uses of controlled substances in accordance with the provisions of decision X/14 for 2004 and 2005, and are to be reconsidered at the Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties based on information reported in accordance with paragraph 4 of the present decision and paragraph 4 of decision X/14;   To note that, because the two uses of controlled substances at the end of the table below were submitted to the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel but not formally reviewed, those applications are to be considered process-agent uses of controlled substances in accordance with the provisions of decision X/14 for 2004 and 2005, and are to be reconsidered at the Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties based on information reported in accordance with paragraph 4 of the present decision and paragraph 4 of decision X/14.
