The Secretariat reported on the earthquake that occurred in the south of Peru on 23 June 2001 and caused the loss of life of seventy people, made more than 20,000 people homeless and seriously affected the infrastructure in the region. It also reported that the World Heritage site of Arequipa suffered damage, most particularly the cathedral. The Secretariat noted that the inscription of the site on the World Heritage List in 2000 was the culmination of a great effort of the national and municipal authorities in establishing adequate protection and management arrangements for the site. A more detailed report on the state of conservation of the city is included under paragraphs V.250 to V.253 below.
