Delos and Delphi (Greece)  \n The Deputy Director of the World Heritage Centre informed the Committee of the status of the site of Delos, over which the Bureau had expressed some concern in terms of the human resources required for its protection. Following the explanations provided by the Observer from Greece, the Committee took note of the willingness of the Greek authorities to increase the number of guards in spite of the problems involved in attracting employees to an island which is no longer inhabited. On the other hand, concerning the site of Delphi, the Greek Observer reminded the Committee of the protective measures taken as well as the restoration activities coinciding with the one hundredth anniversary of the excavation works of the Ecole Frangaise d\'Athenes celebrated in 1992. \n &nbsp;
