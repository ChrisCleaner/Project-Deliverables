ICOMOS reported on the state of conservation of the site which, despite one million visitors every year, is maintaining an excellent general appearance. However, urgent attention to the oldest trees is envisaged and a systematic management and development plan should be set up to protect the vegetation. \n The buildings within the boundary walls of the "Gardens" were reported to be in a good state of repair and well maintained. However, the perimeter brick walls are in poor condition due, in many cases, to improper use of the binder in the repair work, and in others to the substitution of the original lime-mortar binders with cement-mortar, which is posing problems of stability as well as not blending with the original walls. \n ICOMOS suggested that the competent authorities be informed of the need for urgent restoration work to the perimeter walls, and for the formulation and application of an overall management plan for the site as a whole, using accepted techniques. \n The Bureau accepted the recommendations and requested the centre to inform the Pakistani authorities accordingly.
