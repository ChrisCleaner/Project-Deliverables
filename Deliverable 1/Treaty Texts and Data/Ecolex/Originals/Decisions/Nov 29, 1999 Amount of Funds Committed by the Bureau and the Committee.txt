XV.9  The Committee and the Bureau together approved US$ 345,700 for natural heritage requests, US$ 30,000 for a mixed heritage request, and US$ 1,058,983 for cultural heritage requests, amounting to a total of US$ 1,434,683. Should all recommended amounts for the requests under US$ 20,000 for cultural heritage training be approved by the Chairperson, there will be virtually no funds remaining for this category of assistance for year 2000. Moreover, should all recommended amounts for preparatory assistance be approved by the Chairperson, there will remain approximately US$ 29,035 under this category of assistance, funded from the World Heritage Fund Chapter III. \n  XV.10  The table below (next page) indicates the amount of funds committed by the Bureau (underline) and the Committee ( bold ) during the twenty-third session of the Committee.
