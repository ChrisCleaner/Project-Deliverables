Commends  the State Party for their continued support of programmes to manage fire and invasive species, in particular in the Table Mountain part of the property;  4. Notes with concern  the high frequency of fires in the property and the associated impact on ecosystems, as well as challenges in the control of invasive alien plants;  5. Urges  the State Party to continue pursuing efforts towards establishing a single coordinating authority for the property that would eventually facilitate the buffering and extension of the property to include adjoining protected areas;  6. Also urges  the State Party to ensure that the budgets and staffing for its public works programmes are increased to meet the needs of these programmes, and that CapeNature and the other relevant management authorities are adequately funded, in particular to ensure that invasive plant clearance targets are achieved, and that the effects of burning are monitored;  7. Encourages  the State Party to pursue rigorous monitoring programmes and feedback mechanisms for adaptive conservation and management strategies, particularly for fire control;  8. Requests  the State Party to provide the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2009,  with a report on the progress made in the implementation of the recommendations outlined above, including information on the budgets allocated to the property for each of its programmes, and in each component park of the serial property, for examination by the Committee at its 33rd session in 2009.
