The Bureau was pleased to note that as requested by the Committee at its last session, the Panamanian authorities have agreed to the inscription of this transborder national park as a single site on the World Heritage List. The Bureau urged the Costa Rican authorities to clarify their position to the Secretariat on this matter. The Bureau recalled that during its last session in Banff, the Committee also requested the Costa Rican authorities to revise the boundaries of the La Amistad National Park within their country in accordance with the recommendations made by IUCN. The Bureau noted with satisfaction that the Costa Rican authorities have submitted preliminary proposals for new boundaries and that IUCN had reviewed them and suggested modifications to excise three of the Indian reserves and add one wildlife refuge. The Bureau requested the Secretariat and IUCN to continue communications with the Costa Rican authorities in order to finalize the new boundaries of the La Amistad National Park of Costa Rica and submit them to the consideration of the Committee at its forthcoming session.
