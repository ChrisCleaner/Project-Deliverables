The Standing Committee shall establish a working group to review Resolution Conf. 10.9 on Consideration of proposals for the transfer of African elephant populations from Appendix I to Appendix II as appropriate. The working group could consider, inter alia, issues such as the scope of the Resolution; its relationship with Resolution Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) on Criteria for amendment of Appendices I and II; and whether or how a more efficient and cost-effective mechanism to review elephant listing proposals could be developed. The Standing Committee will report its proposals at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties. The working group shall work in collaboration and consultation with all African elephant range States. To the extent possible, the working group will operate in English and French.
