The Bureau at its twenty-third ordinary session, was informed by the Centre on the continued and worsening rebel activity and insecurity in the districts of Kasese and Bundibugyo, which surround the Rwenzori Mountains. In a letter dated 14 May 1999, the Uganda Wildlife Authority informed the Centre that the Rwenzori Mountains National Park has been insecure since June 1997 and the Park has therefore been closed and no meaningful conservation activities have been taking place. The long term negative impact on the flora and fauna and the general environment cannot be predicted, nor is it possible to predict when the conflict will end.&nbsp; The Bureau therefore was informed that Rwenzori also needs special efforts of the Centre and IUCN in any campaigns to raise awareness of the needs of biodiversity conservation in times of armed conflict and civil unrest. \n The Bureau expressed its serious concerns regarding the worsening security conditions in the site and invited the State Party to submit to the Centre, before 15 September 1999, a detailed report on the state of conservation of the site.&nbsp; The Bureau requested the Centre and IUCN to analyse that report and submit their findings and recommendations to the twenty-third extraordinary session of the Bureau in November 1999. \n Furthermore, the Bureau in accordance with the wish of the Chief Executive Officer of the Uganda Wildlife Authority, recommended that the World Heritage Committee include the Rwenzori Mountains in the List of World Heritage in Danger at its twenty-third session to be held in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 November to 4 December 1999.&nbsp;
