Plitvice   Lakes National Park (Croatia)  \n The site was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1992. Missions to the site were carried out in 1992 and 1993. Given the fact that there had been a recent outbreak in fighting in the Bihac region, the situation remains critical. The Committee decided, therefore, that another fact-finding mission to this area, particularly to the Korkaova Uvala Virgin forest should take place. The Committee decided to retain the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
