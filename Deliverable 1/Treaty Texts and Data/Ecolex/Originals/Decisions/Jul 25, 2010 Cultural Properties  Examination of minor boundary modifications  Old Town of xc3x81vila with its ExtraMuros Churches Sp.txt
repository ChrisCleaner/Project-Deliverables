The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Documents WHC-10/34.COM/8B and WHC-10/34.COM/INF.8B1.Add, \n 2.  Refers  the proposed buffer zone for the  Old Town of &Aacute;vila with its Extra-Muros Churches, Spain , back to the State Party in order to allow it to finalize the management plan for the property and to develop a retrospective Statement of Outstanding Universal Value as the basis for the management plan; \n 3.  Notes  that further progress has been made in developing a detailed management plan that will respond to the needs of the city in terms of protection of the built fabric and to the need to sustain and enhance the social and economic framework of the city \n 4.  Considers  that the management plan should be based on an agreed Statement of Outstanding Universal Value that must be primarily based on the Outstanding Universal Value of the property that was recognised at the time of inscription. Whereas other values might well have been identified since inscription in response to changing ideas of heritage and can be the subject of the management plan, there is a need to differentiate between the Outstanding Universal Value, which is non-negotiable, and other values.
