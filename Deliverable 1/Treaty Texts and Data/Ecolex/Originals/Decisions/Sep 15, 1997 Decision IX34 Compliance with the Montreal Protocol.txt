The  Ninth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. IX/34  to remind all Parties that the Parties decided in their decision IV/14, adopted at the Fourth Meeting of the Parties, to clarify as follows, for purposes of Article 7, the distinction to be made between cases of transshipment of controlled substances through a third country and cases of imports and subsequent re-exports:     For cases of transshipment of controlled substances through a third country, it was clarified that the country of origin of the controlled substances shall be regarded as the exporter and the country of final destination shall be regarded as the importer. In such cases, the responsibility for reporting data shall lie with the country of origin as the exporter and the country of final destination as the importer; and   For cases of import and re-export, it was clarified that import and re-export should be treated as two separate transactions; the country of origin would report shipment to the country of intermediate destination, which would subsequently report the import from the country of origin and export to the country of final destination, while the country of final destination would report the import.
