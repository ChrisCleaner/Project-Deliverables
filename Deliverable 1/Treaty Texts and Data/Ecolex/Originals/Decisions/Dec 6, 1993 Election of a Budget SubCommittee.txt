VIII.1  The Secretary of the Committee, Mr von Droste, first explained the rationale for setting-up a budget sub&shy;committee, pointing out that its main tasks would be to (i) review the statement of the accounts; (ii) fix the budgetary ceiling; (iii) establish a reserve fund and (iv) allocate amounts to each budgetary line. Thereupon the Committee decided that the Sub-Committee would consist of the members of the previous and the new Bureau. It was asked to report to the Committee before the end of the session. (See Part XII of the Report.) \n &nbsp;
