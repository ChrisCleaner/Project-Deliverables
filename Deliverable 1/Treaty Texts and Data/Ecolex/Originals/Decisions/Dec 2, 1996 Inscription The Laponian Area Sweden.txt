The Laponian Area  \n  774  \n  Sweden     \n  C   (iii) (v) N (i) (ii) (iii)   \n The Committee decided to inscribe the nominated property on the basis of natural criteria (i), (ii) and (iii) and cultural criteria (iii) and (v). The Committee considered that the site is of outstanding universal value as it contains examples of ongoing geological, biological and ecological processes, a great variety of natural phenomena of exceptional beauty and significant biological diversity including a population of brown bear and alpine flora. It was noted that the site meets all conditions of integrity. The site has been occupied continuously by the Saami people since prehistoric times, is one of the last and unquestionably largest and best preserved examples of an area of transhumance, involving summer grazing by large reindeer herds, a practice that was widespread at one time and which dates back to an early stage in human economic and social development. \n The Committee underlined the importance of the interaction between people and the natural environment. Furthermore, it recommended that the Swedish authorities continue to work with local Saami people, extend the inventories on species, consolidate the management plan for this site and would welcome the consideration of a transboundary site with Norway. \n The name of the property has been changed to  "The Laponian Area".  \n &nbsp;
