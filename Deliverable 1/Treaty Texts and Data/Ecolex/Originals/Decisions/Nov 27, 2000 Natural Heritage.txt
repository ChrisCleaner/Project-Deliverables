VIII.2  The Committee was informed that in accordance with the recommendation it made at the last session, the Centre and IUCN had organised a workshop on the "Role of World Heritage Danger Listing in Promoting International Co-operation for the Conservation of World Natural Heritage" on 6 and 7 October 2000 in Amman, Jordan, at the time of IUCN\'s Second World Conservation Congress. As requested by the participants of that Workshop, the Committee noted the seven priority recommendations included in WHC-2000/CONF.204/9 and suggested that the Centre consider incorporating them as appropriate in revisions to the  Operational Guidelines . The Committee requested the Centre and IUCN to consult with States Parties and other suitable partners to study the feasibility of implementing the priority recommendations and submit a report to the twenty-fifth session of the Committee in 2001. \n &nbsp;
