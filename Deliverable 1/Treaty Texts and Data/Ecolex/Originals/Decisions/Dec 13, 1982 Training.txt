The Chairman reported that the Bureau had recommended that priority in training activities should be given to group training at the local and regional levels and that the training of individual persons should be essentially limited to short-term refresher courses. The Rapporteur presented the requests for such training activities that had been submitted by States Parties as part of technical co-operation projects and recalled that these would be funded under the budget line for training which had just been adopted by the Committee, amounting to US$ 500,000.
