Igua&ccedil;u   National Park  \n  355  \n  Brazil  \n The Committee noted that the Bureau had recommended the inscription of this property and had suggested that it could be considered as a single transfrontier property along with the contiguous Iguazu National Park in Argentina, inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1984. The Secretariat informed the Committee that the Brazilian authorities had requested the Committee to postpone the examination of this nomination. The representative of Brazil explained that the authorities wished to study the points raised by the Bureau in its report. It was further indicated that this nomination could be re-examined by the Bureau at its next session. The Committee accordingly expressed the wish that the property would be inscribed on the World Heritage List at its 10th session in 1986. \n &nbsp;
