Verla Groundwood and Board Mill  \n  751  \n  Finland    \n  C (iv)  \n The Committee decided to inscribe the nominated property on the basis of cultural criterion (iv) considering that the Groundwood and Board Mill and its associated habitation is an outstanding and remarkably well preserved example of the small-scale rural industrial settlement associated with pulp, paper, and board production that flourished in northern Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th centuries, of which only a handful survives to the present day. \n The Committee congratulated Finland on the inscription of this site which is the most representative example of this type of industrial heritage. \n &nbsp;
