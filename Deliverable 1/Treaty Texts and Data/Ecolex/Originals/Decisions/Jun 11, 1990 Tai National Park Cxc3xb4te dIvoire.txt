The Bureau noted that the Chairman had approved US $7,500 under preparatory assistance for drawing up a technical co-operation project for buffer zone development which could benefit local people resident around this park. In the meantime, however, the Bureau was concerned about reports of heavy commercial poaching in the area, particularly on Maxwell\'s duikers. The Bureau was informed that a meeting is scheduled to be held in Abidjan, C&ocirc;ted\'Ivoire, on 27 June 1990, with Unesco, UNDP and several national agencies, at which proposals for launching a pilot project for the conservation of this site would be discussed. Depending on the outcome of this meeting the Bureau requested that the Secretariat contact the Ivoirian authorities to encourage them to nominate this site for inclusion in the List of World Heritage in Danger.
