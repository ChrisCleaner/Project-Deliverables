Kremlin and Red Square (Russian Federation)  \n The Committee was informed that the Ambassador and Permanent Delegate of the Russian Federation to UNESCO informed the Director-General of UNESCO of a project concerning the possible erection of a monument in honour of Marshal G. Zoukhov on the Red Square. The Director-General, in a letter to the mayor of Moscow dated 2 December 1994, underlined that the responsibility for protecting a cultural property lies with the state Party concerned, which should conserve it and avoid taking any measures that would damage it. The Director-General suggested in his letter that another appropriate location be sought for the monument and requested that UNESCO be consulted prior to undertaking any proposed work on the Red Square and the Kremlin. The Committee fully endorsed this position and requested to be kept informed on any development in this World Heritage site. \n &nbsp;
