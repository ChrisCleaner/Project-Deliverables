Noting  that paragraph 3 of Article 4B of the Montreal Protocol requires each party, within three months of the date of introducing its system for licensing the import and export of new, used, recycled and reclaimed controlled substances in annexes A, B, C and E to the Protocol, to report to the Secretariat on the establishment and operation of that system,    Noting with appreciation  that 192 of the 194 parties to the Montreal Amendment to the Protocol have established import and export licensing systems for ozone-depleting substances as required by the Amendment and that they have provided disaggregated information on their licensing systems detailing which annexes and groups of substances under the Montreal Protocol are subject to those systems,    Noting , however, that Botswana and South Sudan, which became parties to the Montreal Amendment in 2013, have not yet established such systems,    Recognizing  that licensing systems provide for the monitoring of imports and exports of ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances, prevent illegal trade and enable data collection,    Recognizing also  that the successful phase-out of most ozone-depleting substances by parties is largely attributable to the establishment and implementation of licensing systems to control the import and export of ozone-depleting substances,   1. To request Botswana and South Sudan to establish an import and export licensing system for ozone-depleting substances consistent with Article 4B of the Protocol and to report to the Secretariat by 31 March 2014 on the establishment of that system;   2. To review periodically the status of the establishment of import and export licensing systems for ozone-depleting substances by all parties to the Protocol as called for in Article 4B of the Protocol;
