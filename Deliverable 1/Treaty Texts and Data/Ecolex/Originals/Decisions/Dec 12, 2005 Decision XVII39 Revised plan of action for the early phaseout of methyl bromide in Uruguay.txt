The  Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVII/39:      To note that Uruguay ratified the Montreal Protocol on 8 January 1991, the London Amendment on 16 November 1993, the Copenhagen Amendment on 3 July 1997, the Montreal Amendment on 16 February 2000 and the Beijing Amendment on 9 September 2003. The country is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol in 1993. Since approval of the country programme, the Executive Committee has approved $5,457,124 from the Multilateral Fund to enable compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;   To recall that Uruguay\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for the controlled substance in Annex E (methyl bromide) is 11.2 ODP-tonnes. It reported consumption of 17.7 ODP-tonnes of methyl bromide in 2002. As a consequence, for 2002 Uruguay was in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2H of the Montreal Protocol;   To recall further that Uruguay had submitted a plan of action to ensure a prompt return to compliance with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s methyl bromide control measures, which was contained in decision XV/44 of the Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties;   To note that Uruguay reported consumption of 11.1 ODP-tonnes of methyl bromide in 2004. This level of consumption, while consistent with the requirement that Parties operating under Article 5 of the Protocol freeze their methyl bromide consumption in 2004 at their baseline level, was inconsistent with the Party\xe2\x80\x99s commitment contained in decision XV/44 to reduce its methyl bromide consumption to a level no greater that 4 ODP-tonnes in 2004;   To note with appreciation, however, that Uruguay submitted a revised plan of action for methyl bromide early phase-out in controlled uses, and to note, without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Protocol, that under the revised plan Uruguay specifically commits itself:     To reduce methyl bromide consumption from 11.1 ODP-tonnes in 2004 as follows:     To 8.9 ODP-tonnes in 2005;   To 8.9 ODP-tonnes in 2006;   To 8.9 ODP-tonnes in 2009;   To 6.0 ODP-tonnes in 2010;   To 6.0 ODP-tonnes in 2011;   To 6.0 ODP-tonnes in 2012;   To phase out methyl bromide consumption by 1 January 2013, save for critical uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To monitor its system for licensing imports and exports of ozone-depleting substances, including quotas;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 5 above should enable Uruguay to maintain compliance and to urge Uruguay to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase out consumption of the controlled substance in Annex E (methyl bromide);   To monitor closely the progress of Uruguay with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of methyl bromide. To the degree that Uruguay is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Uruguay should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Uruguay, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner, the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of methyl bromide that is the substance that is the subject of non-compliance is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
