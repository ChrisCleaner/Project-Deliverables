Inscribes  the site of Um er-Rasas (Kastrom Mefa\'a), Jordan on the World Heritage List on the basis of cultural criteria (i), (iv) and (vi):    Criterion (i):  Um er-Rasas is a masterpiece of human creative genius given the artistic and technical qualities of the mosaic floor of St. Stephen\'s church.
