The Bureau was informed of the project to construct a major highway across the Park, which would be financed by a number of Development Banks. Several impact studies - some contradictory in their conclusions - had been made: the Bureau expressed its preference for the alternative route outside of the Park to the North, which in addition to preserving the natural values of Niokolo-Koba, would serve to link up isolated villages. The Bureau requested the Secretariat to prepare a letter to the highest authority in Senegal recalling this State Party\'s obligation to protect the natural values for which Niokolo&shy;Koba was inscribed on the World Heritage List and expressing the Bureau\'s strong preference for the alternative route outside the Park.
