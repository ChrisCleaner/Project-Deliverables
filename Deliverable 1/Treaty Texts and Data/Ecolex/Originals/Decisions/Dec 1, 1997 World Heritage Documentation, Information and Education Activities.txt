XII.16  With regard to partnerships with the media and publishing houses, the Committee expressed concern about the use of the emblem and quality control The Committee requested the Consultative Body to submit to it recommendations on the use of the emblem and guidelines for fund-raising. This would allow the development of a policy for outside partnerships that the Centre would implement. The Delegates of China and Japan commended the efforts of the Centre in building partnerships with the media, stating that in their countries World Heritage films produced by Beijing Television and Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS), respectively, has been diffused widely, informing large audiences of the importance of World Heritage. The delegate of Japan stated that more than half of the income from media contracts come from Japanese companies, showing how despite the late accession of Japan to the Convention, there is a tremendous public interest in World Heritage which is inspired by the media. \n  XII.18  The Committee took the following decisions with regard to activities under Sections A to D: \n  1. Under Section A. the Committee agreed not to approve the request for the purchase of equipment under A.7 and A.8 from the World Heritage Fund as a matter of principle, indicating that equipment to be used by the Secretariat should be financed under the Regular Programme Budget. The Committee therefore decided to allocate US$ 38,000 from the World Heritage Fund for 1998 for the documentation.  2. Under Section B, the Committee decided to allocate US$165,000 from the World Heritage Fund in 1998, but requested the Secretariat to submit a proposal on means of cost recovery for posters, maps and other material being produced under this section as well as the possibility of co-production of such material for mass distribution.  3. Under Section C, taking into account the comments of several Committee members on the need to use the radio medium, the Secretariat was requested to prepare a strategy and plan of action on how to support States Parties efforts to produce radio programmes on World Heritage. The Committee decided to approve the budgetary ceiling of US$ 70,000 for Section C, stating that up to US$ 20,000 can be used to prepare a strategy on radio programming instead of the proposed activity C.5.  4. Under Section D, the Committee decided to allocate US$ 10,000 to be used to promote the involvement of publishing firms and national television companies in developing countries, in addition to the earmarked income for servicing generated from contracts with the media partners to enable the Secretariat to employ consultants and issue fee contracts for backstopping the contracts and carrying out content validation of the World Heritage information products being produced by the partners. \n  XII.19  To enable the Committee to address outstanding issues related to information activities, notably on the guidelines on the use of the World Heritage emblem for information and the private sector fund-raising activities, as well as on content validation, it was decided that the Consultative Body would continue its work and submit its recommendation to the Bureau in June 1998 and to the Committee at its twenty-second session. It was agreed that the Consultative Body would also look into the information strategy especially with the view to improving the target of the various information material being produced by UNESCO as well as by the media partners. \n  XII.29  It was suggested that the project also involve tertiary education and work in association with the Culture Sector of UNESCO which has already been involved in projects relating to heritage protection and universities .The Committee approved a total amount of US$ 70,000 for the Young People\'s World Heritage Education Project in 1998.
