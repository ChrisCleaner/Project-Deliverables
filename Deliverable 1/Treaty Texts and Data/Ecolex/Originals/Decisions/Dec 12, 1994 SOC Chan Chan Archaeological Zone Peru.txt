Chan Chan   Archaeological Zone (Peru)  \n The Committee welcomed the initiative of the Government of Peru to organise in October 1995, in collaboration with ICCROM and CRATerre, a regional course on the conservation of adobe, parallel to which the participants and international experts would also evaluate the past conservation practices and experiences in Chan Chan and define new conservation policies for this site. The Committee requested the authorities to submit the results of the course and the assessment of the conservation policies and practices to the Secretariat so that recommendations for future actions can be presented at the next session of the Committee. It decided that this site be retained on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
