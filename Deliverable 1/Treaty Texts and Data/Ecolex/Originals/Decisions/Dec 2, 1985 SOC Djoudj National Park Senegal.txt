Djoudj National Park  , Senegal  :    The immediate situation of this Park, which is threatened by a large hydro-agricultural project, has been alleviated by the construction of a temporary canal. The longer term solutions were investigated by IUCN, Unesco, the Senegalese and Mauritanian authorities at a special workshop held in Senegal in July 1985. The main conclusions of this meeting included the agreement to establish the contiguous area to Djoudj in Mauritania known as Diawling as a national park and to eventually nominate this site with Djoudj as a transfrontier World Heritage property. Also, the completion of the Diama dam in 1986 would improve the water supply for Djoudj, although the effects of another dam, at Manatali, to be completed in 1989 were as yet unknown. IUCN indicated that, in the light of this favorable progress, Djoudj National Park could perhaps be removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger by 1987. \n &nbsp;
