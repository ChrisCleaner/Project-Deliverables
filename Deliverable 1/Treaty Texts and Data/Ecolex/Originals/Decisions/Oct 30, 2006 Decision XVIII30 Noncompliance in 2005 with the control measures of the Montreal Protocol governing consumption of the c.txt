1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To note that Mexico ratified the Montreal Protocol on 31\xc2\xa0March 1988, the London Amendment on 11 October 1991 and the Copenhagen Amendment on 16 September 1994, is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol in February 1992. The Executive Committee has approved $83,209,107 from the Multilateral Fund to enable Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;  2.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To note further that Mexico has reported annual consumption for the Annex B, group II, controlled substance (carbon tetrachloride) for 2005 of 89.540 ODP-tonnes, which exceeds the Party\xe2\x80\x99s maximum allowable consumption level of 9.376 ODP-tonnes for that controlled substance for that year, and that Mexico is therefore in non\xe2\x80\x91compliance with the carbon tetrachloride control measures under the Protocol;  3.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To note with appreciation Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s submission of a plan of action to ensure a prompt return to compliance with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s carbon tetrachloride control measures and to note that, under the plan, without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Protocol, Mexico specifically commits itself:  (a)\xc2\xa0 To reduce carbon tetrachloride consumption from 89.540 ODP-tonnes in 2005 as follows:  (i)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To 9.376 ODP-tonnes in 2008;  (ii)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To zero ODP-tonnes in 2009;  (b) To monitor its system for licensing the import and export of ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances, which includes import quotas;  4.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To note that the measures listed in paragraph 3 above should enable Mexico to return to compliance with the Protocol in 2008 and to urge Mexico to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action to phase out consumption of carbon tetrachloride;  5.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To monitor closely the progress of Mexico with regard to the phase-out of carbon tetrachloride. To the degree that the Party is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Mexico should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet its commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Meeting of the Parties cautions Mexico, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner, the Meeting of the Parties will consider measures consistent with item\xc2\xa0C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article\xc2\xa04, such as ensuring that the supply of carbon tetrachloride that is the subject of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance is ceased so that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance;
