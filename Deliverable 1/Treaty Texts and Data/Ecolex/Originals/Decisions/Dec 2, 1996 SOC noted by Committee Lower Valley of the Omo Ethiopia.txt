VII.64 Lower Valley of the Omo (Ethiopia)  \n The Secretariat reported that erosion endangers the site by erasing the markers which had been planted during the last scientific missions of 1974 and 1976 on the major sites, especially those that had revealed hominid fossils. \n Due to the suspension of the international missions since 1976, it was recommended that a survey should be carried out on the present state of the deposits to record the changes brought about by erosion, to seek out the markers still in place, and position each locality by means of a GPS (Global Positioning System) . \n The Bureau took note of the report provided by the Secretariat and encouraged the Centre for Research and Conservation of the Cultural Heritage (CRCCH) to undertake a survey and implement the above-mentioned proposals, and requested the Ethiopian authorities to keep it informed of the progress achieved. \n &nbsp;
