Approves  the extension of  Hadrian\'s Wall  (United Kingdom) to include the Frontiers of the Roman Empire - Upper German-Raetian Limes (Germany) on the World Heritage List on the basis of the cultural criteria (ii), (iii), and (iv), excluding:  a) reconstructions carried out since 1965; and  b) urban development above Roman remains;  3.

Agrees  that the combined Hadrian\'s Wall and Upper German-Raetian Limes sites together be known as the  "Frontiers of the Roman Empire";  6.
