The Bureau informed the Yemeni authorities of its concern with regard to the work undertaken by local donors at the Grand Mosque, part of the World Heritage site of the Historic Town of Zabid, and which appears to be causing serious damage to the authenticity and integrity of the monument. \n It drew their attention to Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the World Heritage Convention whereby States Parties undertake to ensure the protection and the conservation of their heritage, and that conservation must be carried out in accordance with international standards, such as the Charter of Venice, in order to ensure respect of authenticity. It also recalled Paragraphs 24(b), 56 and 75 of the Operational Guidelines for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention. \n Finally, it reminded the Yemeni authorities that the Committee is always willing to provide international expert advice prior to any restoration work.
