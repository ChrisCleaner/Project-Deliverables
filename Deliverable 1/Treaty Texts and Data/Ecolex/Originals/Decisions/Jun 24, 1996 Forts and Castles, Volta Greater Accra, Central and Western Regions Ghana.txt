The Bureau thanked the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board (GMMB) for having provided accurate information on the state of conservation of this site and congratulated the Government of Ghana for their efforts in mobilizing international assistance for the establishment of a Castles Maintenance Trust Fund. It commended the current major conservation programme in Elmina and Cape Coast which should serve as a model for the conservation of the Castle of Osu, Accra. The Bureau recommended that protective action be taken to identify the buffer zones and protect the other coastal forts most at risk and that special attention be paid to the project financed by World Heritage Fund: Fort Prinzensten at Keta.
