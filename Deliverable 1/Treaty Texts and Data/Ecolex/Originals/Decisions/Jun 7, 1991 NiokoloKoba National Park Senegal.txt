The Bureau noted that its recommended study of the ecological and socio-economic impacts of the traces of the two roads -across or around the Park - had been successfully carried out by an independent team which had reached the following conclusions: though both roads would adversely affect the integrity of the Park, the road across it would be less damaging in the long term, provided that a number of accompanying measures (specified in detail) were taken before, during and after the work. The Bureau expressed its concern regarding the potential consequences on the integrity of the site of the construction of a road across the Park; consequently it recommended the adoption of a system of particularly vigilant monitoring of the state of conservation of this property. It also noted that experience of road management within a site on the World Heritage List acquired in other countries, such as Canada, could be usefully made available to the Senegalese authorities. With regard to the accompanying measures recommended by the study, the Bureau nevertheless noted with satisfaction the commitment of the Senegalese authorities to earmark 2.5 million CFA Francs for this purpose; a commitment which had been indicated in principle by the President of Senegal in a letter addressed to the Director-General of UNESCO on 22 May 1991. Consequently, the Bureau took note of this commitment in principle, and requested the Senegalese authorities to send the Secretariat details of schedules and technical modalities for the implementation of these measures, as recommended by the study.
