VII.11 Tasmanian Wilderness (Australia)  \n The Committee recalled that this mixed site was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1982 and that the Bureau at its eighteenth session in July 1994, discussed reports received on logging operations in areas adjacent to the World Heritage area. It furthermore recalled that two concerns were raised: (a) that there is forested land outside the site which may have World Heritage values, and (b) that logging and roading activities adjacent to the site could have an adverse impact on the existing World Heritage site. \n The Committee noted that the national authorities have provided information to the effect that negotiations to alleviate possible impacts are still underway. \n The Committee took note of the action by the State Party to strengthen the protection of the site and that negotiations were still underway, and requested the Centre to contact the state Party to obtain a report on the situation as soon as possible. \n &nbsp;
