Plitvice   Lakes National Park (Croatia)  \n The Centre informed the Committee that a mission was carried out in September 1993 in cooperation with IUCN to Plitvice Lakes National Park. The report noted the continuing cooperation of the authorities in the region as well as that of the United Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR). The report underlined the current situation whereby the natural values of the Park are intact and essentially recovering. There was no evidence of new damage to the Park as a result of the ongoing war in the region. However, social tension had increased and the economic crisis deepened. The mission team was unable to visit the Korkaova Uvala virgin forest because of military mines on the access roads. The Committee took note of the report. \n &nbsp;
