Danube Delta (Romania)  \n The Committee recalled that when this site was inscribed on the World Heritage List at its last session in Carthage, Tunisia, it requested IUCN and the Secretariat to submit a progress report at its sixteenth session. The Committee was concerned that despite assurances given at its last session by the Representative of Romania, the final steps in the process to establish a legislative framework for this site have not yet been completed. The Committee instructed the Centre to contact the competent authorities in Romania to remind them of the assurances they gave the Committee last year and urge them to finalize the process to establish a legal framework for the protection of the site. \n &nbsp;
