The  Ninth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. IX/32:      To note the Czech Republic\xe2\x80\x99s non-compliance in 1995 with the freeze in the consumption of methyl bromide. According to the information provided by the Czech Republic, in 1995 a total of 11.16 ODP tonnes of methyl bromide was imported, of which 7.9 ODP tonnes was consumed in 1996, and no methyl bromide was imported in 1996;   To note that, consequently, although the 1995 imports of methyl bromide exceeded the freeze level of 6.0 ODP tonnes for the Czech Republic, the average annual consumption for the two years 1995 and 1996 was below that level;   That no action is required on this incident of non-compliance but the Czech Republic should ensure that a similar case does not occur again.
