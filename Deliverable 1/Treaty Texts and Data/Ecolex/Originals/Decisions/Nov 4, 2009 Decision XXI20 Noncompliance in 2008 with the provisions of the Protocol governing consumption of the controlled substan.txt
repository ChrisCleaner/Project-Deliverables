Noting  that Mexico ratified the Montreal Protocol on 31 March 1988, the London Amendment on 11 October 1991, the Copenhagen Amendment on 16 September 1994, the Montreal Amendment on 28 July 2006 and the Beijing Amendment on 12 September 2007, and is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol,  Noting also  that the Executive Committee has approved $96,073,703 from the Multilateral Fund to enable Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol,     That Mexico reported annual consumption for the controlled substances in Annex\xc2\xa0B, group II (carbon tetrachloride), of 88.0 ODP-tonnes in 2008, an amount inconsistent with its commitment contained in decision XVIII/30 to reduce carbon tetrachloride consumption to no greater than 9.376 ODP-tonnes in that year, and that the Party is therefore in non-compliance with the control measures for that substance under the Protocol for that year;   To record with appreciation the submission by Mexico of a plan of action to ensure its prompt return to compliance with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s carbon tetrachloride consumption control measures under which, without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Protocol, Mexico specifically commits itself:     To reducing carbon tetrachloride consumption to no greater than zero ODP-tonnes in 2009 and thereafter;   To monitoring its system for licensing the import and export of ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances, including import quotas;     To urge Mexico to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement its plan of action to phase out consumption of carbon tetrachloride;    To monitor closely the progress of Mexico with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of carbon tetrachloride. To the degree that the Party is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Mexico should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance;    To caution Mexico, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance, that in the event that it fails to return to compliance the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article\xc2\xa04, such as ensuring that the supply of carbon tetrachloride that is the subject of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance is ceased so that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance;
