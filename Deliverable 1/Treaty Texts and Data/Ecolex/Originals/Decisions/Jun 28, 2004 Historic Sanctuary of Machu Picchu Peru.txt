Acknowledging that efforts have been made to address specific issues such as\nthe creation of a Management Unit, the management of the Inca Trail and the\nworks undertaken at the Citadel,\n8. Noting, also, that some of the most relevant issues remain unaddressed, and\nthat some of the foreseen actions have been at the stage of proposals over the\npast 5 years, while the state of conservation and management of the property\nhave not improved significantly as compared to the situation referred to in the\nmission reports of 1999 and 2002,\n9. Requests the World Heritage Centre, working jointly with the Government of\nPeru and the World Bank, to set up a programme and action plan for scientific,\ntechnical and financial support to assist and guide the Management Unit and\nrelated institutions in the integrated conservation of the property and to\nfacilitate implementation of the 1999 and 2002 UNESCO-ICOMOS-IUCN\nrecommendations;\n10.
