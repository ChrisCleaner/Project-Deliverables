The Bureau recalled that it was informed of an interim plan submitted by the authorities of Oman in 1997, which foresaw a new outer boundary, and provisional boundaries for five management zones, the construction of an administrative headquarters, visitor and local service centres and other facilities. Also foreseen was the launching of pilot projects in a variety of fields, including environmental tourism, and possible allocation of financial and human resources for the development of the site as Oman\'s first national park. As requested by the Bureau, the authorities of Oman submitted a draft map showing the outer boundary of the Sanctuary and the provisional boundaries of the five management zones and a report on the status of the Arabian Oryx population in the Sanctuary. \n The Bureau noted IUCN&rsquo;s comments that the management plan and map still exists only in a draft form and that IUCN will postpone its review of the plan until such time as the final version is available. The Bureau invited the State Party to inform the Centre about the finalisation of the management plan as early as possible and submit it to IUCN and the Centre for review.
