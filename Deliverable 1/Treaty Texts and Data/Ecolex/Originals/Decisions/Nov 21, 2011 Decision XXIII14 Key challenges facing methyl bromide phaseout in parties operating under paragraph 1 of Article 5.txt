Noting  that the report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel\xe2\x80\x99s task force on the 2012\xe2\x80\x932014 replenishment does not include a funding requirement for methyl bromide phase-out activities in Africa for the triennium 2012\xe2\x80\x932014, since all of the eligible funding for the region has already been approved,     Aware  that methyl bromide is the only ozone-depleting substance directly connected to food security (production and post-harvest applications), and that its phase-out could easily be reversed,     Considering  that it is necessary to continue to use chemical and non-chemical alternatives, and that the efficacy of those alternatives in the short term, medium term and long term should be taken into consideration,    Noting   with concern  that some applications of methyl bromide, such as the treatment of high\xe2\x80\x91moisture fresh dates, still lack alternatives,    Aware  that methyl bromide consumption, particularly in the quarantine and pre\xe2\x80\x91shipment sector, is increasing in many parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol,     Acknowledging  that some African countries report that there is strong pressure to return to methyl bromide use as a result of the non-sustainability of alternatives, both in terms of availability and cost,     Noting  that some African countries further report that certain chemical and non-chemical alternatives that have been adopted to replace methyl bromide in Africa have been unsustainable for various technical, economic and/or regulatory reasons,    Aware  that some chemical alternatives that have been adopted and are relied upon are being or will be banned completely in the future,    Concerned  that the application of some chemical alternatives is complicated and not cost-effective,    Recalling  that methyl bromide is used in Africa to protect crops, which are considered to be the backbone of the economies of many parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5,    Mindful  that the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee pointed out in its May 2011 progress report that parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 might wish to submit critical-use nominations for the remaining uses of methyl bromide that they consider appropriate for 2015 and possibly thereafter,\xc2\xa0     Taking into consideration  the difficult and complex technical process involved in submitting critical-use nominations,   1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol to consider requesting its Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, when carrying out the evaluation approved at its sixty-fifth meeting on methyl bromide projects in Africa, to consider options for a strategy to achieve the sustainable use of effective alternatives to methyl bromide in Africa;   2.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, in view of its May 2011 progress report, to consider whether the guidelines and criteria for the preparation of critical-use nominations of methyl bromide need any modification to take into account the situation of parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and to report on this issue to the Open-ended Working Group at its thirty-third meeting; \xc2\xa0
