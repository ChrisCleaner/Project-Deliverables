Royal   Chitwan National Park (Nepal)    \n The Committee noted with satisfaction that, following the concerns expressed by the Bureau in June 1990 about the possible impact of an irrigation project whereby as much as 75 percent of the waters of the Rapti River would be diverted, the said project was reassessed by the Asian Development Bank and the Government of Nepal and that it would probably be modified significantly to minimize its negative impact on the environment.   \n The Committee requested the Secretariat and IUCN to monitor the progress of this issue until a final decision is reached and to report to the Bureau at its next session. \n &nbsp;
