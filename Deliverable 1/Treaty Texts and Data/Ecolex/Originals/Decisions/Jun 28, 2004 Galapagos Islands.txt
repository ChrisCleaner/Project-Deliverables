The World Heritage Committee, 1. Noting with concern the events that have occurred in Galapagos and their potentially negative impact on the integrity of the Galapagos Marine Reserve. This recent development is not in line with previous efforts implemented by the State Party oriented to enhance the conservation of this property. It is also in direct contradiction with the high standards set by the State Party when implementing a truly participatory process to define the Fishery Regulation under the Special Law for Galapagos, 2. Observes with concern that the quarantine system in Galapagos, vital in preventing further introductions of species harmful to wildlife and humans, is not yet fully operational and that the State Party has not yet assumed full responsibility for its operation; 3. Requests the State Party to uphold and maintain the integrity of the Galapagos Special Law, which is critical to the orderly decision-making process relating to resource use and development in Galapagos and to ensure that the fishing quotas established by the due processes under the Galapagos Special Law are respected; 4. Commends the State Party for taking the initiative to have the Galapagos Marine Reserve designated as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area and encourages it to share this experience with other States Parties with Marine World Heritage properties; 5. Welcomes the United Nations Foundation\'s continued interest in Galapagos and the new support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; 6. Requests the State Party to provide a report on the state of conservation of the property and in particular to advise on what legal and institutional measures are going to be taken to ensure the full application of the Special Law for Galapagos by 1 February 2005, for examination by the Committee at its 29th session in 2005.
