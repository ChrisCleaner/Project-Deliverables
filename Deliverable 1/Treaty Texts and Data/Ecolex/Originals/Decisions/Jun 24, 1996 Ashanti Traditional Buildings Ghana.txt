The Bureau, concerned by the inadequate level of resources available for the conservation of the fragile Ashanti Traditional Buildings recommended that the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board, in cooperation with the Centre, prepare comprehensive conservation and site management plans within the context of envisaged regional integrated development programmes. It requested the Ghana authorities to inform the World Heritage Committee before its twenty-first session at the latest, on the initiatives taken in this matter.
