The Bureau recalled that the World Heritage Committee at its nineteenth session discussed a report presented by IUCN, which underlined the infrastructural developments in the "Bow Corridor" and their impact on the integrity of the site. IUCN advised the Centre that it had submitted a brief to the Task Force which is due to report in September 1996. \n The Bureau recommended that the Bureau at its twentieth extraordinary session in November 1996 examines the Task Force report.
