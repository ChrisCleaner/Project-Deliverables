32. In connection with the assistance requested by States Parties for carrying out promotional activities, the Bureau  recommended  that such assistance should be provided only for the production of general information material on the Convention, and no for the promotion of any particular World Heritage property. \n Furthermore, considering the budgetary allocations set aside for promotional activities, such assistance could only be of modest proportions, complementing national investments. However, the Bureau  noted  that the Secretariat should be flexible in judging each case accordingly. \n In particular, the Bureau  recommended  to the Committee a detailed study, in collaboration with the authorities of the People\'s Republic of China, on the request for the production of a film on World Heritage properties, within and outside of China, to improve the understanding of the Convention among the Chinese public.
