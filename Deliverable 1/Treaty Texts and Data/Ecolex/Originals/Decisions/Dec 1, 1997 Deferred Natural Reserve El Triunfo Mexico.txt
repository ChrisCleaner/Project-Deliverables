Natural Reserve El Triunfo  \n  807  \n  Mexico    \n The Committee noted that the twenty-first extraordinary session of the Bureau decided, after having heard the evaluation by IUCN, to bring this nomination to the twenty-first session of the Committee. \n In presenting its evaluation, IUCN noted that the field inspection originally planned for March had to be postponed until November. The conclusions of the report were: (1) the site is one of high importance for conservation within Mexico but, however, in the regional context it is one of many cloud forest protected areas; (2) the conditions of integrity are not met; (3) the boundaries of the site should be revised to exclude the buffer zone and the adjacent Pico El Loro-Paxtal forest be added; (4) a transfrontier nomination with the cloud forest park of Sierra de las Minas in Guatemala, which was deferred by the Bureau in 1993, should be considered as one unit in a Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. \n After having heard IUCN\'s evaluation report and taking account of the ambiguities contained therein as well as the delay in presenting the report (28 November 1997), not allowing time for a satisfactory analysis by the Bureau, during its June session nor during its extraordinary session on 28 and 29 November 1997, or the Committee, from 1 to 3 December 1997, the Delegation of Mexico requested that the analysis of the natural site of "El Triunfo, Chiapas" be deferred. The Committee accepted this request. \n &nbsp;
