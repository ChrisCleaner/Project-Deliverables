Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu (Peru)  \n As part of the assistance provided by the World Heritage Fund, an international archaeological seminar was held in September 1993 with the participation of national and international experts and bilateral cooperating agencies. The seminar concluded that coordination should be improved among institutions dealing with the Park\'s management, that an inventory of the cultural and natural resources should be pursued and that archaeological research and conservation actions should be redefined. The preparation of an operational plan for the Park should be of the highest priority. \n &nbsp;
