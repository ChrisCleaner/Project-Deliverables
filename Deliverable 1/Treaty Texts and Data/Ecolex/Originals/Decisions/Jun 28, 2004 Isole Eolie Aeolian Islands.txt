The World Heritage Committee, 1. Noting the report provided by the State Party that so far no further pumice quarries have been opened and no extension to the four existing quarries within the World Heritage property has been granted, 2. Welcomes the positive proposal from the Pumex Society, and the initiative of the State Party of informing IUCN of this proposal, for the environmental recuperation of areas currently being exploited within the property and the rehabilitation of unused industrial buildings into hotels and tourist services, thus assisting in replacing jobs lost in the extractive industry; 3. Urges the State Party to seek long-term solutions towards a closure of the existing quarries, to stop all mining activities in the World Heritage property and to keep the World Heritage Centre and IUCN informed about further developments.
