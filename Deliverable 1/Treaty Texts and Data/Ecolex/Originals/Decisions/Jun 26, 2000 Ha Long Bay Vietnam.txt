The Centre informed the Bureau that the donor roundtable for developing projects to strengthen the capacity of the Ha Long Bay Management Department will take place on 19 and 20 July 2000 and that a feasibility study for a project to develop the Ha Long Bay Ecomuseum for US$ 130.000 is being carried out by UNDP Hanoi. \n IUCN informed the Bureau that it had carried out a detailed state of conservation report for this site following a field mission. A number of improvements in the management were noted. However, significant challenges remain which include over-fishing and solid and organic waste in Ha Long Bay. Key recommendations include the need for effective regional planning which considers the impact of activities within the region, as well as the need to strengthen the Ha Long Bay Management Department. IUCN suggested that this be reported to the next session of the Bureau. \n The Bureau commended the State Party&rsquo;s efforts to continuously improve this World Heritage area located in an area of intense economic development activities. The Bureau invited the State Party to consider implementing the recommendations of the state of conservation report of IUCN.&nbsp; The State Party should also co-operate with the Centre and IUCN to negotiate with donors to launch programmes and projects to strengthen the long-term conservation of the World Heritage area with progress being reported back to the Bureau at its twenty-fourth extraordinary session.
