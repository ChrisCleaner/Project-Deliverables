Property:  The Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Bo&iacute;  \n Id. N&deg;:  988  \n State Party:  Spain    \n Criteria:  C (ii) (iv)  \n The Committee decided to inscribe this property on the World Heritage List on the basis of  criteria (ii) and( iv) : \n  Criterion (ii) : The significant developments in Romanesque art and architecture in the churches of the Vall de Bo&iacute; testify to profound cultural interchange across medieval Europe, and in particular across the mountain barrier of the Pyrenees. \n  Criterion (iv):  The Churches of the Vall de Bo&iacute; are an especially pure and consistent example of Romanesque art in a virtually untouched rural setting. \n In relation to the works of art of these churches, which are currently exhibited in a museum in Barcelona, ICOMOS recommended that the State Party investigate the possibility of returning some of these to their original location. \n The Delegate of Finland recalled his previous statement on the necessity of a sub-numbering system for serial nominations such as this property. He urged the Committee to examine this issue. The Delegate of Ecuador disagreed with the proposal of a sub-numbering system. \n The Committee noted the change of name of the property from  The Catalan Romanesque Cultural Landscape of the Vall de Bo&iacute;  to  The Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Bo&iacute; . \n &nbsp;
