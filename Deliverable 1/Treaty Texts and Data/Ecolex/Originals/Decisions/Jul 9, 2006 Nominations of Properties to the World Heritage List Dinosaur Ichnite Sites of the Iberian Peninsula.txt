The World Heritage Committee,   1.  Having examined  Documents  WHC-06/30.COM/8B  and  WHC-06/30.COM/INF.8B.2 ,   2.  Defers  examination of the nomination of the  Dinosaur Ichnite Sites of the Iberian Peninsula, Spain , to the World Heritage List on the basis of natural criterion (i), in view of the need for in-depth assessment and substantial revision of this nomination;   3.  Recommends  that, in reconsidering the potential to strengthen the possible case for outstanding universal value of the nomination, the State Party give particular attention to:   a) A definition of a more focused conceptual framework that clearly demonstrates the relationship of dinosaur ichnite sites in Spain to other important fossil sites in Portugal;   b) The relationship of any revised nomination to the interests of the footprint site in Bolivia, currently the subject of preparatory assistance funded by the World Heritage Fund;   c) A thorough, global comparative analysis, including justification for a property based on dinosaur ichnites to be considered as being of outstanding universal value;   d) A serial nomination, which is coherent and manageable, focused around a much smaller number of localities and with all the elements selected relating to global significance;   4.  Commends  the State Party for the exemplary cooperative and participatory approach to site conservation and research, and the significant commitment that has been given to the recognition of the values of the nominated serial property by the State Party, the Autonomous Communities, the different communes involved and their citizens.
