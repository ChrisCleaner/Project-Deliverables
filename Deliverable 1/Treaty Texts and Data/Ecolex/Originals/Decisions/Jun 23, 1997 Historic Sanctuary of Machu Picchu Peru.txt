The Bureau thanked the Government of Peru for the report on Machu Picchu prepared by the National Institute for Culture. It expressed its concern, however, about the apparent lack of integral management mechanisms for the property and the implementation and/or consideration of several projects that might have a negative impact either on its natural or cultural values. The Bureau, therefore, requested IUCN and ICOMOS to undertake a joint mission to Machu Picchu in order to examine the management and conservation of the site and to draw up recommendations for future actions. The Bureau requested IUCN and ICOMOS to submit a report on the mission to the twenty-first session of the World Heritage Committee. \n The Bureau suggested that the mission also examines the measures taken for the protection and conservation of the Chan Chan Archaeological Zone, on which the Committee at its twentieth session requested the Government of Peru to submit a full state of conservation report by 15 September 1997.
