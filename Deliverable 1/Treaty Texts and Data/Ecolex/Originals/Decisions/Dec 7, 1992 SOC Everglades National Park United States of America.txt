Everglades   National Park   (United States of America)  \n The Delegate for the United States of America informed the Committee members of the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew to this site. The hurricane which affected extensive areas in south Florida on 24 August 1992, damaged virtually all large hammock trees and destroyed 20-25% of the royal palms, 25-40% of the pines, 90% of trees where the red-cockaded woodpeckers nested and 70,000 acres of mangrove forests. Despite the extent of the damage caused, the Committee noted with satisfaction that a post-hurricane survey of the area undertaken by a team of 25 scientists has indicated that the recovery of vegetation and the status of wildlife populations was satisfactory. The representative of IUCN informed the Committee that IUCN has discussed the desirability of preparing a monitoring report, in 1993, on the Everglades with the US National Park Service. IUCN will consult with the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention to obtain information on the recovery of the Everglades system from damage caused by Hurricane Andrew, as well as the impacts of the diversion of waters flowing into the Everglades for agricultural and industrial uses. \n The Representative of IUCN said that a monitoring report to made to the Bureau is being considered, which may include a recommendation to inscribe the Everglades on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
