This archaeological site, inscribed in 1990 and excavated since the 19th century, continues to suffer from violent winds, high humidity and the sea. Conservation work has not been carried out systematically after each excavation campaign, and the site museum is too small. Moreover, the personnel responsible for the surveillance of the site appear to be insufficient. Furthermore, it seems that pastures close to the archaeological site have been rented to the Municipality of Myknos for grazing land. \n The Bureau requested the World Heritage Centre to ask the Greek authorities for precise information on the possibility of a concession of grazing land close to the archaeological site, and the action they would be obliged to take to ensure the conservation of Delos.
