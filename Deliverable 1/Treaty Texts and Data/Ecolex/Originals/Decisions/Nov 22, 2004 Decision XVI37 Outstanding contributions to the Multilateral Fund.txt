The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/37:    Aware of the forthcoming negotiations on the replenishment of the Multilateral Fund for the next triennium,    Noting  that some Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 have never paid their contributions to the Multilateral Fund or have done so in an amount inferior to one annual contribution,    Recalling  paragraph (c) of decision 39/5 of the Executive Committee, which urged those Parties to pay their contributions for the 2003-2005 triennium to enable Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 to comply with the 2005-2007 control measures of the Montreal Protocol and to avoid shortfalls arising from the non-payment or delayed payment of pledged contributions during the compliance period for Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5,   To urge those Parties to pay their outstanding contributions to the Multilateral Fund as soon as possible, in view of the current compliance needs of Parties operating under Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol.
