The Bureau was pleased to note that two more rhino calves were born in this site and the rhino population has now risen to 28, almost double that of 1985 when the site was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Bureau was satisfied that the budget for this site has increased by 400% and that as suggested by the Committee at its last session, the Zairois authorities have requested that this site be removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Bureau recommended that the Committee recognize that the small rhino population is still vulnerable and therefore continue to co&shy;operate with other donors in supporting requests for rehabilitation. The Bureau also suggested that the Committee remove this site from the List of the World Heritage in Danger.
