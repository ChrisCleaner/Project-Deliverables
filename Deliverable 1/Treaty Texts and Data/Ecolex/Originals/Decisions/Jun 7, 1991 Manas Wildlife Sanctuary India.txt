The Bureau noted with concern that the integrity of this site continues to be threatened by the invasion of a resistance movement which has burnt buildings, destroyed bridges, killed a number of park guards, looted most Park facilities, poached numerous rhinos, elephants, tigers and other wildlife, removed valuable trees and depleted fish stocks in the Manas River. The Bureau recalled that the Indian authorities were requested by the Committee, in 1989 and in 1990, to nominate this site to the List of World Heritage in Danger. Although the Bureau acknowledged that the survey of the villages around this Park that is being undertaken by WWF could lead to a more co-operative approach to management of the Sanctuary in the future, the Bureau was of the view that in the meantime the site has been seriously degraded. Hence, the Bureau recommended that the Director-General of UNESCO write to the Indian authorities requesting them to nominate this site for inclusion in the List of World Heritage in Danger.
