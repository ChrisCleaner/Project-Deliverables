Mount   Nimba strict Nature Reserve (Guinea/cote d\'Ivoire)  \n The site was included on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1992 because of a proposed iron-ore mining project and threats due to the arrival of a large number of refugees. An expert mission was undertaken in 1993 and proposals to revise the boundaries of the site were endorsed by the seventeenth session of the Committee in 1993. An international assistance project under the World Heritage Fund was carried out in 1994. The Committee was informed that the French Ministry of Cooperation and the Ministry of the Environment in cooperation with IUCN France is carrying out a study and review of the site with regard to potential future investment. A report on this project is expected in due course. \n The Committee decided to retain this site on the List of World Heritage in Danger and requested that the Bureau at its nineteenth session be informed of the results of the French mission. \n &nbsp;
