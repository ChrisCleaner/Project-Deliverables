The Centre informed the Bureau that the UNESCO/IUCN mission to the site, recommended by the twenty-third session of the Bureau, had been postponed and could now proceed in September 2000. \n IUCN pointed out that it is looking forward to participating in the mission, which will focus on practical means to address destructive fishing practices for local communities and viable development such as ecotourism. IUCN also noted that the UN Foundation has approved a project with the aim of improving the global coverage of marine World Heritage sites. \n The Bureau urged the Centre and the State Party to co-operate in preparing the mission to the site and to provide a report including mitigation measures against threats caused by dynamite and cyanide fishing in time for the twenty-fourth session of the World Heritage Committee.
