Since this site was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1988, IUCN, in co-operation with the Direction des Parcs Nationaux du Senegal (DPN) and the Netherlands Research Institute of Nature Management, has prepared an up-date of actions on the management plan with special emphasis on the interactions between the Park and the surrounding communities. IUCN\'s Regional Office in Dakar, Senegal, organized a Wetland Management Training Course, from 4-15 March 1991, for twelve students from Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Senegal, as part of IUCN\'s Wetland Programme activities, and with financial support from the Government of Netherlands. As a result of the training course a wetland training manual will be published. The Bureau recommended that the Committee take note of these positive actions in furthering the recovery of the Djoudj National Park.
