Noting  that the transition from, and phase\xe2\x80\x91out of, ozone-depleting substances has implications for climate system protection,   Recognizing  that decision XIX/6 encourages Parties to promote the selection of alternatives to hydrochlorofluorocarbons to minimize environmental impacts, in particular impacts on climate,   Recognizing also  that there is scope for coordination between the Montreal Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol for reducing emissions and minimizing environmental impacts from hydrofluorocarbons, and that Montreal Protocol Parties and associated bodies have considerable expertise in these areas which they could share,   Recognizing further  that there is a need for more information on the environmental implications of possible transitions from ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances to high-global warming potential chemicals, in particular hydrofluorocarbons,    To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to update the data contained within the Panel\xe2\x80\x99s 2005  Supplement to the IPCC/TEAP Special Report  and to report on the status of alternatives to hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, including a description of the various use patterns, costs, and potential market penetration of alternatives no later than 15 May 2009;    To request the Ozone Secretariat to prepare a report that compiles current control measures, limits and information reporting requirements for compounds that are alternatives to ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances and that are addressed under international agreements relevant to climate change;    To request the Ozone Secretariat with input, where appropriate, from the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol to convene an open\xe2\x80\x91ended dialogue on high-global warming potential alternatives for ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances among Parties, including participation by the assessment panels and the Multilateral Fund Secretariat, and inviting the Fund\xe2\x80\x99s implementing agencies, other relevant multilateral environmental agreement secretariats and non-governmental organizations to discuss technical and policy issues related to alternatives for ozone-depleting substances, with a particular focus on exchanging views of the best ways of how the experience from the Montreal Protocol can be used to address the impact of hydrofluorocarbons, and also with a view to maximizing the ozone and climate benefits of the hydrochlorofluorocarbon early phase-out under the Montreal Protocol;    To encourage Parties to include their climate experts as participants in the workshop;    That the above-mentioned dialogue on high-global warming potential alternatives to ozone-depleting substances should be held just before the twenty-ninth meeting of the Open-Ended Working Group and that interpretation will be provided in the six official languages of the United Nations;    To request the co-chairs of the workshop, in cooperation with the Ozone Secretariat, to prepare a summary report of the discussions that take place during the dialogue and to report on the proceedings to the Open-ended Working Group at its twenty-ninth meeting;    To invite one representative of a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and one representative of a Party not so operating to serve as co-chairs of the workshop;    To request the Ozone Secretariat to communicate the present decision to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol and to encourage that secretariat to make the decision available at the fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to that Convention for possible consideration of participation in the workshop;
