A. NATURAL HERITAGE  \n   A.2 Requests for which the Bureau formulated a recommendation to the Committee   \n  A.2.1 Technical co-operation  \n  A.2.1.2 Vallee de Mai (Seychelles)  \n The Bureau  examined  the request from the Seychelles for the construction of a Visitor Information Centre in this World Heritage site. The Bureau  was concerned  about: the size of the site, the location of the Visitor Centre in the site, and  noted  the fact that construction had commenced despite previous concerns raised by the Bureau regarding size of the structure and its view that the development may be excessive. \n Furthermore the Bureau  recalled  that the Committee recommended an extension of the site when it was inscribed in 1983. The Bureau  deferred  a decision and  requested  the Centre to advise the Government about these concerns. \n The Bureau  requested  IUCN to carry mission to examine the potential for site impact of the construction. \n &nbsp;
