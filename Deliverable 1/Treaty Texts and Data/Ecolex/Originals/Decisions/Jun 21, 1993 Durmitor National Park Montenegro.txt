The Bureau recalled that the Committee, at its last session, noted that the authorities responsible for the management of this site are of the view that the proposed construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Tara River and the pollution of the River by an asphalt dam situated upstream had minimal impacts on the conservation of Durmitor National Park. The Bureau acknowledged the fact that the Montenegro authorities had invited a UNESCO/IUCN mission to the site and that this mission should be undertaken as early as possible in order to ensure the conservation of this World Heritage site. However, the Bureau noted that given the current situation of conflicts within the former territory of Yugoslavia, and UNESCO\'s obligation to conform to Resolution 757 of the UN Security Council, the UNESCO World Heritage Centre was unable to proceed with the organization of the UNESCO/IUCN mission to Durmitor National Park. The Bureau therefore expressed the hope that the situation will change soon and the World Heritage Centre can proceed to organize this mission.
