Recognizing  that for the past several years the Secretariat has been following the informal guidance set out in the report of the Eighteenth Meeting of the Parties   [6]    to round its data reported to the parties to one decimal place,    Acknowledging  the low ozone-depletion potential of many Annex C, group I, controlled substances (hydrochlorofluorocarbons),    Taking into consideration  the small quantities of hydrochlorofluorocarbons used by a significant number of parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5,    Understanding  that, as a result of the low ozone-depletion potential of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, rounding to one decimal place could result in the continued use of a substantial amount of those substances,    Wishing  to ensure that any change in the number of decimal places used to calculate baselines, consumption and production is forward looking and does not cause changes in previously submitted data,   To direct the Secretariat to use two decimal places when presenting and analysing for compliance hydrochlorofluorocarbon baselines established after the Twenty-Third Meeting of the Parties and annual hydrochlorofluorocarbon data reported under Article 7 for 2011 and later years;       [6] \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNEP/OzL.Pro.18/10.
