Serra da Capivara (Brazil)  \n The UNDP/UNESCO Regional Project presented a report on this complex site that contains 380 sites of historical interest and where the greatest threats come from fire and poaching. Tourism, although in the increase, had not had a negative impact on the site yet. A zoning plan was being introduced which defined the degree of access to five different types of area with various levels of access. \n The monitoring mission recommended that: \n - the zoning plan should be extended so as to cover the whole area of the park and that buffer zones be established to limit the threats form fires; \n - barriers be constructed at the more accessible sites to prevent visitors from damaging them and that interpretation panels should also be installed. \n &nbsp;
