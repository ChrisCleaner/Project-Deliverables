The  Thirteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XIII/10:     Noting  that the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and Technical Options Committee review recommended that just-in-time production of CFCs for the manufacture of metered-dose inhalers is the best approach to protect the health of patients,    Noting, however,  the possibility that just-in-time production of CFCs for the manufacture of CFC-based MDIs may not be available through to the end of the transition, and that the end of just-in-time production could come unexpectedly,     To note with appreciation the work of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Technical Options Committees in studying the issue of campaign production of CFCs for manufacturing CFC-based MDIs;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and Technical Options Committees to analyse the current essential-use decisions and procedures to identify if changes are needed to facilitate expedient authorization for campaign production, including information needed for the review and authorization of nominations for campaign production quantities, the contingencies for under- and over-estimation of the quantities needed for a campaign production, the timing of the campaign production vis-\xc3\xa0-vis export and import of those quantities, the oversight and reporting on the use of campaign production quantities, and the flexibility in ensuring that the campaign production is used only in the manufacture of MDIs for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or that any excess is destroyed;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to present its findings to the Open-ended Working Group in 2002;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to continue to monitor and report on the timing of the likely need for campaign production.
