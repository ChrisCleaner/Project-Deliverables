The Bureau noted that the Chairperson of the World Heritage Committee approved, in 1996, a sum of US$ 20,000, for the implementation of a project entitled "Protection and Information and Education Campaign for the Conservation of Tubbataha Reef Marine Park". The Bureau was happy to note that the Project Management Team (PMT) has regular consultations with Government agencies, research institutions and local communities concerned with the project\'s implementation and that a Presidential Task Force has brought together all groups interested in the conservation of this World Heritage site. In addition the Bureau noted that a symposium had been convened on 31 March 1997 for raising public awareness of the Management Plan for Tubbataha Reef. \n The Bureau encouraged the PMT to provide the Centre with a copy of the Management Plan for Tubbataha Reef and submit periodical reports on the progress made by the Project and the status of conservation of Tubbataha Reef Marine Park. The Bureau also commended the Marine Parks Centre and the Environment Agency of Japan for financing several projects in support of the conservation of this World Heritage site.
