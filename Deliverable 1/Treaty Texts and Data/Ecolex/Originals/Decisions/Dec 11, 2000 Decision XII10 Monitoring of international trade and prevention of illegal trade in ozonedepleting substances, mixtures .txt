The  Twelfth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XII/10:     Recognizing  the threat of illegal trade in ozone-depleting substances, mixtures and products containing ozone-depleting substances to the global process of ozone layer protection,    Understanding  the importance of control of trade in ozone-depleting substances, mixtures and products containing ozone-depleting substances in all Parties in view of the need for global implementation of the provisions of the Montreal Protocol,    Acknowledging  that presently the effective control at national borders of trade in ozone-depleting substances, mixtures and products containing ozone-depleting substances is very difficult due to problems in ozone-depleting substances identification, the complexity of relevant customs codes, the lack of an internationally accepted common labelling system and the lack of specially trained customs officers, and the need to approach most of these problems by concerted action at the international level,    Acknowledging  that it is important to understand the status of and take into account ongoing work in this area by other international bodies, and take into consideration previous decisions of the Parties, including decisions IX/22, X/18 and XI/26,     To request the Ozone Secretariat, in consultation, as appropriate, with the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, the United Nations Environment Programme, the discussion group on customs codes for ozone-depleting substances and international trade and customs organizations, to examine the options for studying the following issues and to report on these options at the twenty-first meeting of the Open-ended Working Group for consideration by the Parties in 2001:     Current national legislation on the labelling of ozone-depleting substances, mixtures containing ozone-depleting substances and products containing ozone-depleting substances;   The need for, scope of and cost of implementation of a universal labelling and/or classification system for ozone-depleting substances, mixtures containing ozone-depleting substances and products containing ozone-depleting substances, including the feasibility of the introduction of a producer-specific marker, identifier or identification methodology;   Methods for sharing experience between Parties on issues related to classification, labelling, compliance and incidents of illegal trade;   The differences between products containing ozone-depleting substances and mixtures containing ozone-depleting substances, and the possibility of the creation of a list of categories of products containing ozone-depleting substances with the corresponding Harmonized System/Combined Nomenclature classification;   Possible guidance for customs authorities on how to proceed with the illegally traded ozone-depleting substances seized on the border;     To express appreciation for the activities of the Division of Technology, Industry and Economics of the United Nations Environment Programme and to encourage further work with regard to providing information on the above to Article 5 Parties and countries with economies in transition, specifically through customs training at the regional and/or national level.
