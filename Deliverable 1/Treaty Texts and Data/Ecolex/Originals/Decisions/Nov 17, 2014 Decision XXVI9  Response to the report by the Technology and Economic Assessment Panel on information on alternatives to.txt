Noting with appreciation  volume 2 of the 2012 Technology and Economic Assessment Panel report on the task force progress report which responded to decision XXIII/9, volume 2 of the 2013 progress report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel which responded to decision XXIV/7 and volume 4 of the 2014 progress report which responded to decision XXV/5,   1. To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, if necessary in consultation with external experts, to prepare a report identifying the full range of alternatives, including not-in-kind technologies, and identifying applications where alternatives fulfilling the criteria identified in paragraph 1 (a) of the present decision are not available, and to make that report available for consideration by the Open-ended Working Group at its thirty-sixth meeting and an updated report to be submitted to the Twenty-Seventh Meeting of the Parties that would:   (a) Update information on alternatives to ozone-depleting substances in various sectors and subsectors and differentiating between parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and parties not so operating, considering energy efficiency, regional differences and high ambient temperature conditions in particular, and assessing whether they are:   (i) Commercially available;   (ii) Technically proven;   (iii) Environmentally sound;   (iv) Economically viable and cost effective;   (v) Safe to use in areas with high urban densities considering flammability and toxicity issues, including, where possible, risk characterization;   (vi) Easy to service and maintain;   and describe the potential limitations of their use and their implications for the different sectors, in terms of, but not limited to, servicing and maintenance requirements, and international design and safety standards;   (b) Provide information on energy efficiency levels in the refrigeration and air\xe2\x80\x91conditioning sector referring to high-ambient temperature zones in international standards;   (c) Taking into account the uptake of various existing technologies, revise the scenarios for current and future demand elaborated in the October 2014 final report on additional information on alternatives to ozone-depleting substances of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel\xe2\x80\x99s task force on decision XXV/5, and improve information related to costs and benefits with regard to the criteria set out in paragraph 1 (a) of the present decision, including reference to progress identified under stage I and stage II of HCFC phase-out management plans;   2. To convene a two-day workshop, back to back with an additional three-day meeting of the Open-Ended Working Group in 2015, to continue discussions on all issues in relation to hydrofluorocarbon management, including a focus on high-ambient temperature and safety requirements as well as energy efficiency, taking into account the information requested in the present decision and other relevant information;   3. To encourage parties to continue to provide to the Secretariat, on a voluntary basis, information on their implementation of paragraph 9 of decision XIX/6, including information on available data, policies and initiatives pertaining to the promotion of a transition from ozone-depleting substances that minimizes environmental impact wherever the required technologies are available, and to request the Secretariat to compile any such submissions received;   4. To request the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund to consider providing additional funding to conduct inventories or surveys on alternatives to ozone-depleting substances in interested parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 upon their request;
