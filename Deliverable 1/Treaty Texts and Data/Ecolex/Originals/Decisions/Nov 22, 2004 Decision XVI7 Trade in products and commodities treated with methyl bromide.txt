The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/7:     Noting  that many of the Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol derive a portion of their national income from trade in commodities which currently rely on methyl bromide for their production or shipment,    Acknowledging  that alternative practices, treatments and products are becoming increasingly available for methyl bromide treatments,    Recalling  that, taking into account the shared but differentiated responsibilities of the Parties regarding the protection of the ozone layer, the aim of each Party to the Montreal Protocol is to phase out the controlled ozone-depleting substances,     To invite the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, subject to rights and obligations under this agreement and any other international agreements, not to restrict trade in products or commodities from Parties that have ratified the Montreal Protocol provisions regarding methyl bromide and are otherwise in compliance with their Montreal Protocol obligations just because the commodities or products have been treated with methyl bromide, or because the commodities have been produced or grown on soil treated with methyl bromide;   To welcome the continuing efforts of the Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol in the adoption of alternatives to methyl bromide.
