The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Documents WHC-12/36.COM/8B and WHC-12/36.COM/INF.8B1 ,   \n 2.  Refers  the nomination of the  Sacral Complex on the remains of the Roman Forum in Zadar ,  Croatia , back to the State Party in order to allow it to: \n a) Consider whether it is possible to review the justification for the nomination on the basis of more substantial evidence to support the idea that the Sacral Complex could be considered exceptional as an ensemble related to the way it developed over time, \n b) Support such a review by a detailed comparative analysis that compares the ensemble with other religious ensembles, including both those inscribed on the World Heritage List and others, to demonstrate that the Sacral Complex has no comparators; \n 3.  Recommends  that the State Party give attention to the following: \n a) Review the visitor management concept to incorporate larger visitor flows in the historic city and review the carrying capacity of individual buildings, not only in terms of physical visitor impacts, such as humidity, abrasion and vandalism, but also in terms of their atmospheric impacts, \n b) Expand the partnership established for the management of the site to include the relevant authorities responsible for tourism and spatial planning in the historic city, \n c) Implement the traffic exclusion plans for the western part of the historic city and re-utilizing the public space east of the Roman forum in a way that can contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the historic surroundings, \n d) Expand the buffer zone to protect not only the immediate setting of the Sacral Complex but also the wider setting of the historic peninsula, in particular through inclusion of the urban components along the shores of the peninsula bay, \n e) Develop a conservation plan based on an approach of minimalistic intervention, \n f) Develop a risk preparedness strategy, which gives adequate attention to earthquakes, fires and cultural events which attract considerable visitor numbers, \n g) Review the monitoring system and indicators proposed, to allow for anticipation of threats or challenges and adequate monitoring of the property; \n 4.  Also recommends  the State Party to invite a consultative mission by ICOMOS as soon as possible.
