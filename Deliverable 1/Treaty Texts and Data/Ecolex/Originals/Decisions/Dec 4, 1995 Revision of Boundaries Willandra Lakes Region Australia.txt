Willandra   Lakes   Region  \n  167 Rev.  \n  Australia    \n  N(i)C(iii)  \n The Committee recalled that the site was included on the World Heritage List as a mixed site in 1981. The Committee took note of the new boundary proposal and the information by the Delegate of Australia that the reduction in the size of the area would enhance the World Heritage values of the site. \n The Committee, furthermore, having taken note of the fact that the new boundary will reduce the total area by about thirty percent, adopted the revised boundaries, as they better define the area containing the World Heritage values and will considerably facilitate the management of the property. \n &nbsp;
