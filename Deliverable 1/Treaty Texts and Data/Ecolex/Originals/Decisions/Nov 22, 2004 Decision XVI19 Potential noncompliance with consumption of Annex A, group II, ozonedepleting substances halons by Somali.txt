The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/19:      To note that Somalia has reported annual data for Annex A, group II, ozone-depleting substances (halons) for both 2002 and 2003 which are above its requirement for a freeze in consumption;   To note further that, in the absence of further clarification, Somalia is presumed to be in non-compliance with the control measures under the Protocol;   To request Somalia, as a matter of urgency, to submit to the Implementation Committee for consideration at its next meeting explanations for its excess consumption, together with a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance. Somalia may wish to consider including in its plan of action the establishment of import quotas to freeze imports at baseline levels and support the phase-out schedule, a ban on imports of ozone-depleting-substances-using equipment, and policy and regulatory instruments that will ensure progress in achieving the phase-out;   To monitor closely the progress of Somalia with regard to the phase-out of halons. To the degree that Somalia is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Somalia should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet its commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Meeting of the Parties cautions Somalia, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner, the Meeting of the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of halons (that is, the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
