Recognizing  the difficulties faced by countries operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol in their search for viable alternatives to analytical methods that comply with international standards,   Considering  that carbon tetrachloride plays an important role in analytical and laboratory processes and that there are currently no alternatives to it for some of those processes in Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5,   Recalling  that in decision XVII/13 the Parties agreed that the Implementation Committee and the Meeting of the Parties should defer until 2007 consideration of the compliance status in relation to the Montreal Protocol control measures for carbon tetrachloride of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5,   Recalling   also  that in decision XVII/13 the Parties agreed that the Nineteenth Meeting of the Parties would review the deferral referred to above in order to address the period\xc2\xa02007\xe2\x80\x932009,   1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That the Implementation Committee and the Meeting of the Parties should defer until 2010 consideration of the compliance status in relation to the control measures for carbon tetrachloride of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 which provide evidence to the Ozone Secretariat with their data reports, submitted in accordance with Article 7, showing that any deviation from the respective consumption target is due to the use of carbon tetrachloride for analytical and laboratory processes;   2.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To urge Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 to minimize the consumption of carbon tetrachloride in laboratory and analytical uses by applying the global exemption criteria and procedures for laboratory and analytical uses of carbon tetrachloride currently established for Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5;
