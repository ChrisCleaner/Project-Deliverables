The World Heritage Committee,   1. Having examined  Documents WHC-07/31.COM/8B and WHC-07/31.COM/INF.8B.2,  2. Inscribes  the  Teide National Park, Spain,  on the World Heritage List on the basis of  criteria (vii)  and  (viii) ;  3. Adopts  the following Statement of Outstanding Universal Value:  Teide National Park, dominated by the 3,781 m Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcano, represents a rich and diverse assemblage of volcanic features and landscapes concentrated in a spectacular setting.   Criterion (vii):  Mount Teide is a striking volcanic landscape dominated by the jagged Las Ca\xc3\xb1adas escarpment and a central volcano that makes Tenerife the third tallest volcanic structure in the world. Within this landscape is a superlative suite of landforms that reveal different phases of construction and remodeling of the volcanic complex and highlight its unique geodiversity. The visual impact is emphasized by atmospheric conditions that create constantly changing textures and tones in the landscape and a \xe2\x80\x98sea of clouds\' that forms a visually impressive backdrop to the mountain.   Criterion (viii):  Teide National Park is an exceptional example of a relatively old, slow moving, geologically complex and mature volcanic system.\xc2\xa0 It is of global importance in providing diverse evidence of the geological processes that underpin the evolution of oceanic islands, and these values complement those of existing volcanic properties on the World Heritage List, such as the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.\xc2\xa0 It offers a diverse and accessible assemblage of volcanic features and landscapes in a relatively limited area.\xc2\xa0 The area is a major centre for international research with a long history of influence on geology and geomorphology especially through the work of von Humboldt, von Buch and Lyell which has made Mount Teide a significant site in the history of volcanology.  The property is well managed and resourced, with a six-year management plan in place which is due for renewal in 2008.\xc2\xa0 The property is afforded the same legal protection as other national parks in Spain and is surrounded by a buffer zone.\xc2\xa0 Key management issues include the management of tourism, the potential impact of climate change, and effective coordination of management responsibility between national and regional levels of government.  4. Commends  the State Party for its continued efforts to conserve this protected area and for establishing impressive educational and awareness raising programmes in the park;  5. Recommends  the State Party, as part of the process to review and update the management plan for Teide National Park, to:  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 a) Strengthen harmonization between strategic tourism planning and development in the Canary Islands and the use of Teide National Park to ensure that use does not adversely impact the outstanding universal value of the property;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 b) Strengthen mechanisms to monitor visitor use and develop management approaches that balance the protection of park values with enhanced visitor experience;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 c) Encourage improved research and monitoring of the potential impact of global climate change and the need for adaptive management strategies;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 d) Strengthen coordination and cooperation between the Spanish State and Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands to share responsibility and to guarantee central funding; and  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0e) Encourage exchange of management experience and joint promotion between the Teide National Park and other World Heritage properties in the Canary Islands (Garajonay National Park and San Crist\xc3\xb3bal de La Laguna);  6. Requests  IUCN to evaluate the volcanic systems inscribed on the World Heritage List and on the Tentative Lists of States Parties and to present a thematic study for consideration of the Committee.
