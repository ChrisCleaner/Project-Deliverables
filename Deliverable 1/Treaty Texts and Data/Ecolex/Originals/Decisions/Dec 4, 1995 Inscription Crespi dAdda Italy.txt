Crespi d\'Adda  \n  730  \n  Italy  \n  C(iv) (v)  \n The Committee decided to inscribe this property on the World Heritage List on the basis of criteria (iv) and (v), considering that it is an exceptional example of a working village of Europe and North America, dating back to the 19th and 20th centuries, and reflecting the predominant philosophy of enlightened industrialists with respect to their employees. Although the evolution of economic and social conditions constituted an inevitable threat to the survival of Crespi d\'Adda, its integrity is remarkable and it has partly conserved its industrial activity. \n It also congratulated the Italian authorities for the coherence of its conservation programme which had preserved the architectural and social qualities of this property. \n &nbsp;
