Port, Fortresses and Group of Monuments, Cartagena (Colombia)  \n World Heritage assistance has led to the preparation of a municipal legislation for the historical centre. Further assistance was approved by the Bureau for the preparation of a Master Plan for the centre in relation to an overall urban development plan. The Committee was informed of the plans to construct a new bridge, the Heredia Bridge, between the town and Fort San Felipe, just outside the ramparts of the city. This bridge would seriously affect the visual aspect of the site and would disrupt the visual and functional relation between the Fort and the town. The Committee recommended that the local and national authorities study carefully the traffic situation in and around the historical centre, and to consider possible alternatives for the bridge. \n &nbsp;
