The  Twelfth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XII/7:      To note with satisfaction the large number of countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer;   To note that as of 30 November 2000, 142 Parties had ratified the London Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and 113 Parties had ratified the Copenhagen Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, while only 46 Parties had ratified the Montreal Amendment to the Montreal Protocol;   To note further that only one Party has to date ratified the Beijing Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, a situation that will make it unlikely for the Amendment to enter into force by 1 January 2001 as agreed in Beijing in 1999;   To urge all States that have not yet done so to ratify, approve or accede to the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments, taking into account that universal participation is necessary to ensure the protection of the ozone layer.
