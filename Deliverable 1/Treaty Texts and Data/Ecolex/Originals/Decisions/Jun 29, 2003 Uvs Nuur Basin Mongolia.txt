The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Inscribes   Uvs Nuur Basin ,  Mongolia  / Russian Federation , on the World Heritage List on the basis of natural\xc2\xa0 criteria (ii) and (iv):   Criterion (ii):  The closed salt lake system of Uvs Nuur is of international scientific importance because of its climatic and hydrological regimes. Because of the unchanging nature of the nomadic pastoral use of the grasslands within the basin over thousands of years, current research programmes should be able to unravel the rate at which Uvs Nuur (and other smaller lakes within the basin) have become saline (and eutrophic). These processes are on-going and because of its unique geophysical and biological characteristics, the basin has been chosen as an Interntational Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGPB) site for monitoring global warming.    Criterion (iv):  The Uvs Nuur property has a large range of ecosystems, representing the major biomes of eastern Eurasia, with a number of endemic plants. Although the basin is inhabited and has been used for nomadic pastoralism for thousands of years, the mountains, forests, steppes and deserts are extremely important habitats for a wide range of wild animals, many of them threatened or endangered. The steppe ecosystem supports a rich diversity of birds and the deserts a number of rare gerbil, jerboas and the marbled polecat. The mountains at the western end of the basin are important refuges for the globally threatened snow leopard, mountain sheep (argali) and the Asiatic ibex. Uvs Nuur itself is an important habitat for waterfowl as well as for birds migrating south from Siberia.   The inscription is for twelve protected areas:       Cluster name      State Party      Area (ha)      Buffer (ha)       Mongun Taiga     Russian Federation    15,890    84,510      Ubsu-Nur    Russian Federation    4,490    \xc2\xa0      Oroku-Shinaa     Russian Federation    28,750    \xc2\xa0      Aryskannyg    Russian Federation    15,000    11,800      Jamaalyg    Russian Federation    800    4,000      Tsugeer els     Russian Federation    4,900    50,000      Ular    Russian Federation    18,000    20,480      Tsagan shuvuut    Mongolia    23,170    \xc2\xa0      Turgen    Mongolia    116,831    \xc2\xa0      Uvs Lake    Mongolia    424,298    \xc2\xa0      Altan els    Mongolia    148,246    \xc2\xa0      Tes River    Mongolia    97,688.5    \xc2\xa0       TOTAL     \xc2\xa0     898,063.5      170,790       2.  Encourages  the State Party of Mongolia to give priority to upgrading the Tes River Specially Protected Area, currently protected at a provincial level, to a Specially Protected Area under State legislation;   3.  Further encourages  both States Parties to ensure that adequate resources are made available quickly and maintained for the effective implementation of the management plans;  4.  Commends  Mongolia for steps taken to expand the nominated area, and both States Parties for their efforts to date in developing transboundary co-operation for the conservation of the property. The consolidation of such collaboration should be encouraged and maintained.
