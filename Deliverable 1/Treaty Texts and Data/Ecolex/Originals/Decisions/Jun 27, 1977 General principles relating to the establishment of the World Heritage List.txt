Another participant suggested that it should be indicated at the site itself that that site is included on the World Heritage List. On this point, the representative of the Director-General informed members that a World Heritage emblem was under preparation and this could well be used  inter alia  at the sites. It was feared by another participant that sites not included in the List and not marked by the emblem might be neglected by States.
