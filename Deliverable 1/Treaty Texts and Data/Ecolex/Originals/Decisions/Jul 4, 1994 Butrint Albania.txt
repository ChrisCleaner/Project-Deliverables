The Coordinator of the MAP/UNEP "100 historical sites" programme presented this archaeological site inscribed in 1992, which is immerged below 1.50m of water due to subsidence. However, the maintenance work there is being carried out in a satisfactory manner by the Archaeological Institute of the Department of Antiquities, in spite of the lack of human and financial resources. The Bureau was informed of the wish of the Albanian authorities to create a natural and cultural archaeological park. To accomplish this, the Hydrology Institute of Tirana has prepared a study in order to identify the causes of subsidence. Consequently, the Bureau requested the World Heritage Centre to write to the Albanian authorities requesting information on the following: \n -&nbsp;specific legislation for the site \n -&nbsp;results of the study prepared by the Hydrology Institute \n - progress made in the programme for the protection and management of the site; the advisability of setting up a committee of international experts to work together with the archaeological missions working at the site.
