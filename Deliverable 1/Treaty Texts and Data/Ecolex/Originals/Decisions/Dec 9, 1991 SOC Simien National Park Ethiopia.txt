Simien National Park (Ethiopia)  \n The Committee recalled that this Park was abandoned by its staff in 1985 due to civil unrest in the area. The Committee was happy to note that the site had once again become accessible. On the basis of a report submitted by the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Organization, the Committee was informed that all field stations and other infrastructure of the Park had been destroyed. The Committee recognized the need to begin reconstruction work and noted the possibilities for involving local people in this regard. In the light of the urgency to undertake conservation action, the Committee wished to study the possibilities for setting aside a sum of US$ 50,000 from the 1992 budget for the rehabilitation of Simien National Park.
