Samos (  Greece)  \n The Greek authorities informed the Bureau at its seventeenth session that a road project would be undertaken under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture and that this project would not endanger the site nor the Eupalinos Tunnel. The Central Archaeological Council recently informed the Centre that the proposed road project has been rejected. The municipality was therefore studying alternative solutions that would not affect the protected area. \n &nbsp;
