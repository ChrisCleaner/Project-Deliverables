Las M&eacute;dulas   \n  803   \n  Spain     \n  C(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)   \n The Committee decided to inscribe this property on the basis of criteria (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), considering that the Las M&eacute;dulas gold-mining area is an outstanding example of innovative Roman technology, in which all the elements of the ancient landscape, both industrial and domestic, have survived to an exceptional degree. \n The Delegate of Thailand informed the Committee that he was unable to accept the inscription of this site as a cultural property as it did not correspond to the definitions given in Article 1 of the Convention. Furthermore, in applying criterion (i), among others, to signify human creativity, he could only consider this site as a result of human destructive activities as well as harmful to the noble cause of environmental promotion and protection. Germany and Finland agreed with the position of Thailand. \n &nbsp;
