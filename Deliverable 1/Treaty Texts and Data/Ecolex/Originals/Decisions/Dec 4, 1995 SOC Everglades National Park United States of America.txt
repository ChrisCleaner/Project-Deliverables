VII.9 Everglades National Park (United States of   America  )  \n The Committee recalled that the site was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1993 due to an increasing number of threats since the date of its inscription on the World Heritage List in 1979 and that Federal State and local governments, as well as private foundations, had joined forces in providing significant financial support for the management of the site and its long-term restoration. \n The World Heritage Centre presented a monitoring report, received from the State Party in November 1995, indicating that the rehabilitation of the Everglades ecosystem (restoration of water regime) would take 17 years at a cost of US$ 2 billion. The Committee commended the State Party for the actions taken to redress the situation. \n The Committee, however, concluded that the site remains seriously threatened and decided that it be retained on theList of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
