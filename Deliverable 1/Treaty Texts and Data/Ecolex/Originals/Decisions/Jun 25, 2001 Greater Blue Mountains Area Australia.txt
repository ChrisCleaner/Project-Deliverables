V.113&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been reported to IUCN that a mining company, Centennial Coal, has lodged a development application with an environment impact statement for a major mining lease extension for the Clarence Colliery. The Clarence Colliery is located on Newnes Plateau that adjoins the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area to the east. The report received by IUCN notes three environmental concerns related to this proposal which are likely to directly affect the World Heritage values of the Greater Blue Mountains Area. These are: water pollution, water conservation (loss of water to the mine pit) and the protection of the World Heritage area by an adequate buffer zone. \n V.114&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Delegate of Australia informed the Bureau that the proposed mining lease had been referred to the Australian Government under the World Heritage protection regime of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Protection Act.&nbsp; It would assess any potential significant impacts on World Heritage values before any project approval could be given. \n V.115&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Bureau requested the State Party to provide information on the reported lease extension for the Clarence Colliery and its potential impacts on the World Heritage values, before 15 September 2001, to enable the twenty-fifth extraordinary session of the Bureau to assess the potential threats to the integrity of the site.
