The Centre informed the Bureau that it has received several letters concerning the logging of beech forests outside the World Heritage site and has transmitted them for review to IUCN. The Bureau recalled that the site was inscribed in 1993, and that the Committee at the time recommended to review the site after three years. The Bureau invited the Centre to organize a mission to review the progress made in the implementation of the management plan with regard to the requirements of the World Heritage Convention.
