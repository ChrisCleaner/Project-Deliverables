Each Party is requested to report on the implementation of the present paragraph to the Ozone Secretariat by 1 February for the years to which this decision applies;  8.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to continue publishing annually in its progress report prior to each meeting of the Open\xe2\x80\x91ended Working Group the stocks of methyl bromide held by each nominating Party as reported in that Party\xe2\x80\x99s accounting framework report;  9.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To recognize the continued contribution of the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee\xe2\x80\x99s expertise and to agree that, in accordance with section 4.1 of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel\xe2\x80\x99s terms of reference, the Committee should continue to develop its recommendations in a consensus process that includes full discussion among all available members of the Committee;  10. To note the importance of transparency in the critical\xe2\x80\x91use exemption process and to request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to provide to the Open-ended Working Group at its next meeting a written explanation of its methodology for using its meta-analysis in its work and to disclose to the Parties in a written explanation any significant changes or deviations it intends to make to that methodology before it undertakes any such change or deviation;  11. That Parties licensing, permitting or authorizing methyl bromide for critical uses shall request the use of emission minimization techniques such as virtually impermeable films, barrier film technologies, deep shank injection and/or other techniques that promote environmental protection, whenever technically and economically feasible;  12. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That each Party should continue to ensure that its national management strategy for the phase-out of critical uses of methyl bromide addresses the aims specified in paragraph 3 of decision Ex.I/4;   Annex to decision XIX/9: Critical-use exemptions for 2008 and 2009    Table A.\xc2\xa0 2008 agreed critical-use categories (metric tonnes)         Australia      Rice (1.80)*         Canada      Pasta (6.067)         Israel      Dates (1.800), Flour mills (0.312), Broomrape (250.000), Cucumber \xe2\x80\x93 protected (18.750), Cut flowers \xe2\x80\x93 bulbs \xe2\x80\x93 protected (114.450), Cut-flowers \xe2\x80\x93 open field (44.750), Melon \xe2\x80\x93 protected and field (87.500), Potato (93.750), Sweet potatoes (111.500), Strawberry runners (Sharon and Gaza) (31.900), Strawberry fruit \xe2\x80\x93 protected (Sharon and Gaza) (105.960),          Poland      Coffee and cocoa beans (0.500), Medicinal herbs and mushrooms (0.500), Strawberry runners (11.995)         Spain      Cut flowers (Andalucia and Catalonia) (17.000), Strawberry runners (215.000), Strawberry and pepper \xe2\x80\x93 research (0.151)        * \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This amount was first approved in decision XVIII/13, conditional on the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel\xe2\x80\x99s 2007 progress report.
