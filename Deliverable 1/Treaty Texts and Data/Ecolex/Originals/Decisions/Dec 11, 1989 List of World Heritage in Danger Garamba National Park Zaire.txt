Garamba National Park (Zaire)  \n The representative of Zaire thanked the Committee for its continued support for improving the protection and management of this site, which was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1984 due to the alarming reduction in the northern white rhinoceros population. The joint project by the Frankfurt Zoological Society, WWF and the World Heritage Committee had resulted in a promising recovery of these animals. The Committee accordingly recommended that the Zairois authorities should formally request the removal of this site from the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990. \n &nbsp;
