The state of conservation of this Park was the subject of an extensive review submitted by a representative of Colombia\'s Ministry of Environment at a Regional World Heritage Workshop held in the Everglades National Park in November 1997. IUCN drew the attention of the Centre to serious threats to the integrity of this Park, caused by a breakdown of law and order in the area. The Centre contacted the Colombian authorities for confirmation of reports received by IUCN on the state of conservation of Los Katios. The Bureau noted that the Colombian authorities have provided a report on 19 June 1998 to the Centre and requested IUCN to report back on its review of this report to the twenty-second extraordinary session of the World Heritage Bureau.
