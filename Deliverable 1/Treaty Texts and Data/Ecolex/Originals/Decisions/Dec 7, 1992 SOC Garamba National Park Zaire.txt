Garamba   National Park (Zaire)  \n The Committee recalled that at its last session, it deferred taking a decision to remove this site from the List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the uncertainties associated with prevailing civil unrest in Zaire at that time. \n The Committee was happy to note that the rhinoceros population in the Park has now increased to 32 individuals and that the state of conservation of the site continues to be stable. Hence, the Committee recommended, in accordance with the request made by the State Party by letter of 26 February 1991,  to remove this site from the List of World Heritage in Danger.  \n The Committee also recommended that the Centre suggest that the Zairois authorities \n (a) conduct an assessment of the operation of the multi-donor project to date, particularly with regard to institutional arrangements and future directions, and \n (b) continue to co-operate with the Committee and other donors in ensuring that the integrity of the Park is further strengthened. The Committee also requested the Centre to transmit its congratulations to the Zairois authorities to have undertaken all necessary measures which made the removal of this site from the List of World Heritage in Danger possible. \n &nbsp;
