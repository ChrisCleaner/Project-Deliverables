The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Documents WHC-09/33.COM/8B and WHC-09/33.COM/INF.8B1, \n 2.  Refers  the nomination of  The Architectural and Urban Work of Le Corbusier ,  Argentina ,  Belgium ,  France ,  Germany ,  Japan , and  Switzerland , back to the States Parties in order to allow them to: \n a) Strengthen the justification of the Outstanding Universal Value to demonstrate the influence of the works of Le Corbusier on the architecture of the 20th century and the Modern movement, \n b) Improve the delineation of buffer zones in relation to topography and visual parameters, and provide adequate protection, \n c) Put in place management systems and/or management plans to give greater guidance to owners and to draw local authorities and local communities into the management process; \n 3.  Considers  that a revised nomination need not include all 22 of the component parts currently proposed, however, inclusion of any additional component parts in the series would require a new nomination; \n 4.  Invites  the States Parties to strengthen cooperation in order to ensure appropriate protection and management of the property by focusing attention on the buildings and urban ensembles; \n 5.  Encourages  the States Parties to continue work on the global coordination mechanism between the sites associated with Le Corbusier, as being beneficial whether or not these sites are inscribed on the World Heritage List.
