The  Sixth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. VI/8,  that, for the year 1995 no level of production or consumption is necessary to satisfy essential uses of halons in Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol, since there are technically and economically feasible alternatives and substitutes for most applications, and since halons are available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked and recycled halons.
