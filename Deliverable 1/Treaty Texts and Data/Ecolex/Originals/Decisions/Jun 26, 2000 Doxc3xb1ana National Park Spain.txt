IUCN noted some improvements to the situation at the site, but had concerns about: (a) measures to ensure that toxic wastes, to be dumped into the old mine pit will not percolate into the surrounding aquifer; (b) the need for co-ordinating measures between various stakeholders including state and regional authorities. Such co-ordination is essential to address broader regional land issues and their impact on the site. \n The Bureau noted the continuing efforts of the State Party to clean up the area, which indicate a gradual recovery of the Guadiamar River Basin. The Bureau urged the State Party to accelerate implementation of the Do&ntilde;ana 2005 restoration project and implement the review meeting as requested by the last session of the World Heritage Committee and to inform the Centre by 15 September 2000 on tentative dates and a programme for the review meeting. \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp;
