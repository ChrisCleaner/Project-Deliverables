The Bureau took note of the report presented by the Principal Director of the Culture Sector on the plans to enhance the site of the Fortress of Burgos. The Bureau expressed its satisfaction to the local authorities for the decision to re-study the project for the site of the Fortress, taking into account the authenticity of the cultural landscape and the adequate interpretation and presentation of the historical remains. \n It recommended the authorities to undertake a complete and integral study (including aspects of landscaping, urbanism, architecture and archaeology) of the hill on which the Fortress is located, as it is one of the main elements of the cultural landscape of Burgos. \n The Bureau requested the Spanish authorities to present a report on the plans for the hill and the Fortress by 15 September 1998 for examination by the Bureau at its twenty-second extraordinary session.
