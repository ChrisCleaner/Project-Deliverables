The Bureau recalled that the Committee, when it inscribed this site on the World Heritage List in 1988, requested IUCN to submit a progress report in 1991 on the implementation of an effective management regime. The Bureau noted that although a management agency has been set up, the Director and staff were only recently appointed and that the management planning process has been delayed and no additional funds for field management activities have been provided. The Bureau was also concerned about the pace of tourism development and a proposal for a hydropower development project which could impact the site. The Bureau requested that the Australian authorities provide further elaboration on these problems to IUCN so as to enable IUCN to report to the Committee at its forthcoming session in December 1991.
