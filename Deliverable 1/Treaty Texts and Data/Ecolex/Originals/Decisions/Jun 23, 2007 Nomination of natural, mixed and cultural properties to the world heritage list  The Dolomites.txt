The World Heritage Committee,   1.  Having examined  Documents WHC-07/31.COM/8B and WHC-07/31.COM/INF.8B.2,  2. Decides not to inscribe   The Dolomites, Italy,  on the World Heritage List on the basis of criteria (ix) and (x);  3. Defers  the examination of the nomination of  The Dolomites, Italy,  to the World Heritage List on the basis of criteria (vii) and (viii) to allow the State Party to consider submitting a new nomination, more focused and coherent, that meets the conditions of integrity;  4. Recommends  the State Party to consider the following issues in the revision of the nomination:  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 a) Refocus the nomination around the aesthetic, geological and, in particular, geomorphological values of the Dolomites (criteria (vii) and (viii)). These values should be confirmed through a global comparative analysis of the geomorphological, geological (stratigraphy, carbonate systems, palaeontology) and aesthetic aspects that can be regarded as being of Outstanding Universal Value in comparison to mountains already inscribed on the World Heritage List, and other comparable mountains elsewhere in the world; and  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 b) Make a new selection of a site or a much more coherent series of sites to convey those values at a landscape scale, and avoid including very small sites that represent very locally specific values. IUCN has suggested in its evaluation report a more appropriate configuration.  5.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Further recommends  the State Party to address the following specific areas of concerns to meet the conditions of integrity in relation to the requirements for protection and management:  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 a) Ensure that transparent, effective and coordinated legal protection is in place for the entire series that is eventually proposed;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 b) Establish a management framework for the entire series, as a legally approved document to coordinate the management authorities concerned, with clear objectives and a realistic implementation strategy; and  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 c) Consider the need for more effective planning, management and regulation of tourist facilities and activities that are consistent with the carrying capacity of the nominated property. Tourist facilities have reached, or even exceeded, the limits of tolerance for natural World Heritage properties in a number of the core and buffer zones of the nominated property.
