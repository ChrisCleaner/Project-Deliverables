The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/12:     Recognizing  that in its 2002 report, the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee has explicitly acknowledged that there is currently no alternative to the use of methyl bromide for high-moisture dates that is in use in any country in the world,    Recognizing also  that Parties which consume over 80 per cent of their methyl bromide for high-moisture dates cannot meet the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s methyl bromide control schedule without production losses for that important cash crop for their countries,    Recognizing further  the need for further work to be undertaken to demonstrate alternatives to methyl bromide for high moisture dates,     That the Implementation Committee and Meeting of the Parties should defer the consideration of the compliance status of countries that use over 80 per cent of their consumption of methyl bromide on high-moisture dates until two years after the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel formally finds that there are alternatives to methyl bromide that are available for high-moisture dates;   That the above provision shall apply so long as the relevant Party does not increase consumption of methyl bromide on products other than high-moisture dates beyond 2002 levels, and the Party has noted its commitment to minimizing the use of methyl bromide for dates to the extent necessary to ensure effective control of pests;   To request the Executive Committee to consider appropriate demonstration projects for alternatives on high-moisture dates, and to ensure that the results of those projects are shared with the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel.
