With respect to the nomination by the Syrian Arab Republic of Aleppo, the Rapporteur recalled the request made by the Bureau that the Syrian authorities should : \n \n provide a clear definition of the zones granted absolute protection in Aleppo; and \n adapt an urbanization policy analogous to that advocated in the report of the Unesco mission to Aleppo. \n \n As soon as these additional steps have been taken, the Syrian authorities are invited to inform the Secretariat so that the nomination can be re-examined. This information should reach the Secretariat by the end of February 1983 to enable the Bureau to take up this nomination at its next session.
