China (Biodiversity Measuring and Monitoring Course):  the Bureau  reviewed  a request for US$19,000 for a biodiversity measuring and monitoring course to be held in Guangdong Province&nbsp;in China in November/December 1994. It  felt  however that 2 Chinese participants had already been financed from the World Heritage Fund for a similar course in the United States in 1994 and, moreover, that the course did not involve World Heritage site managers, nor was it being held at a World Heritage site. The Bureau therefore,  did not approve  the request.
