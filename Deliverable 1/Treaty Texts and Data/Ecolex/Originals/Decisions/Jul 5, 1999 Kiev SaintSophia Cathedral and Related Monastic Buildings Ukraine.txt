ICOMOS reported on the results of a mission it undertook to Kiev in response to a request made by the Bureau at its twenty-second extraordinary session. The mission looked into the project to rebuild the Dormition Cathedral, particularly its hydrogeological implications. The mission concluded that, with the technology applied for the foundation, concerns for the stability of the soil are unjustified. \n Furthermore, the mission reported that the Hotel Intercontinental project has now been modified and it will not be higher than the surrounding buildings and will not be intrusive. It also reported that the Laboratory House Office building has been lowered and will satisfy the initial objections. \n Other issues discussed during the mission were:&nbsp; the possible extension of the World Heritage site, the need for UNESCO support in obtaining expert advice on open and green spaces, general concern about the state of conservation of the city and the need for an international conference on monument reconstruction in Central and Eastern countries. \n The Bureau expressed its appreciation of the actions taken by the State Party to modify the design of new constructions in Kiev so as to mitigate their impact on the Historic Centre.&nbsp;
