The Bureau took note with satisfaction of the information provided by the Delegate of Lebanon, namely that the project to extend the northern part of the port had been completely abandoned following a Council of Ministers decree and that a joint project of the Ministry of Urbanism and the General Directorate of Antiquities was being implemented to remove the unsightly constructions from the Roman aqueduct. \n The Bureau thanked the Lebanese authorities for the efforts undertaken for the conservation of Tyr. It recommended them to take all legal and financial measures to preserve the hippodrome and the aqueduct.&nbsp; It assured them that a request from the Lebanese Government for international assistance would be favourably considered, as soon as funds are available, in order to implement the recommendations of the UNESCO experts and to contribute towards the launching of the international safeguarding campaign.
