The Bureau noted that in order to accommodate the exploitation of some of the gas deposits under this site which are privately owned, the boundaries of this site have been modified to excise 1,415 acres and add 1,478 acres of higher geological value. Although the Bureau was satisfied with the fact that this swap met the approval of the Provincial Parks Branch of Alberta and the slanted drilling technology to be employed will not have adverse impacts on the integrity of the site, the Bureau observed that drilling of any wells inside the Park would cause greater concern. The Delegate of Canada assured the Bureau that impacts of drilling on the integrity of the Park will be closely monitored by representatives of governmental and non-governmental organizations and the Bureau and Committee would be alerted if any threat arose. A revised map of the new boundaries of the site is now awaited.
