Belovezhskaya Pushcha State National Park  \n  627  \n  Belarus  \n  N(iii)   \n The Committee inscribed the core zone of this property on the World Heritage List, noting that this site is an extension of the Bialowieza National Park of Poland. The Committee inscribed the transfrontier property as a single entry on the World Heritage List as Belovezhskaya Pushcha/Bialowieza Forest of Belarus/Poland. The Committee commended the authorities of the two States Parties for recognizing the ecological unity of the transborder site and agreeing to inscribe the whole area as a single entry on the World Heritage List. The Committee requested the Belarus authorities to prepare a management plan for the area, in co-ordination with the plan available for the Polish part of the site and encouraged the two States Parties to share management experience. The Committee recommended that the fence between the two parks be removed if the management plan indicates that it would lead to enhanced viability. \n &nbsp;
