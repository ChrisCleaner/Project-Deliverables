Recalling  decision XXVIII/2, in which the Meeting of the Parties, inter alia, requested the Executive Committee to develop cost guidance associated with maintaining and/or enhancing the energy efficiency of low-global-warming-potential (GWP) or zero-GWP replacement technologies and equipment when phasing down hydrofluorocarbons, while taking note of the role of other institutions addressing energy efficiency, when appropriate,    Recognizing  the importance of maintaining and/or enhancing energy efficiency while transitioning away from high-GWP hydrofluorocarbons to low-GWP alternatives in the refrigeration, air-conditioning and heat pump sectors,    Noting  that the use of air conditioning and refrigeration is growing in countries operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5,      Recognizing  that maintaining and/or enhancing energy efficiency could have significant climate benefits,   1. To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel in relation to maintaining and/or enhancing energy efficiency in the refrigeration, air-conditioning and heat-pump sectors, including in high-ambient-temperature conditions, while phasing down hydrofluorocarbons under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol in parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5, to assess the following items:   (a) Technology options and requirements including:   (i) Challenges to their uptake;   (ii) Their long-term sustainable performance and viability;   (iii) Their environmental benefits in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents;   (b) Capacity-building and servicing sector requirements in the refrigeration and air-conditioning and heat-pump sectors;   (c) Related costs including capital and operating costs;   2. Also to request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to provide an overview of the activities and funding provided by other relevant institutions, as well as definitions, criteria and methodologies used in addressing energy efficiency in the refrigeration, air-conditioning and heat-pump sectors in relation to maintaining and/or enhancing energy efficiency in the refrigeration, air-conditioning and heat-pump sectors while phasing down hydrofluorocarbons under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, as well as those related to low-GWP and zero-GWP hydrofluorocarbon alternatives including on different financing modalities;   3. To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to prepare a final report for consideration by the Open-ended Working Group at its fortieth meeting, and thereafter an updated final report to be submitted to the Thirtieth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer taking into consideration the outcome of the workshop described in paragraph 4 below;   4. To request the Secretariat to organize a workshop on energy efficiency opportunities while phasing down hydrofluorocarbons at the fortieth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group;
