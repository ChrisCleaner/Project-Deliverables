Saint Sophia (Turkey)  \n During the official visit of the Director-General of UNESCO to Turkey in April 1993, the Turkish authorities drew his attention to the deteriorating state of conservation of Saint Sophia. Subsequently, a mission financed by UNESCO took place to assess the state of conservation of Saint Sophia and concluded that the building was not seriously at risk. However, it was proposed to set up a system of control, especially with regard to all movement which could affect the structure of the building. The evaluation report of the mission would be made available to the Bureau. \n &nbsp;
