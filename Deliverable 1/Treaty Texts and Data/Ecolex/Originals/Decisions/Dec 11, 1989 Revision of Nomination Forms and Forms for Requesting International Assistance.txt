The Committee recalled that the revised versions of forms for nominating sites for inscription on the World Heritage List and for requesting international assistance from the World Heritage Fund had been prepared in accordance with the Operational Guidelines and had been already examined by the Bureau at its 13th session. The Bureau members had since then provided comments which were incorporated in the documents submitted to the Committee. The Committee adopted these revised documents in principle, requesting the Committee members to send any additional suggestions they may have to the Secretariat in writing so that the forms could be finalized and used for implementing the Convention during 1990. \n &nbsp;
