Victoria Falls/Mosi-oa-Tunva  \n  Zambia/Zimbabwe  \n  N(ii)(iii)  \n The Committee commended the Governments of Zambia and Zimbabwe for demonstrating their commitment to co-operate in management of the site through the joint nomination. The Committee agreed to the joint inscription of the property on the basis that both Zambia and Zimbabwe had already agreed to reduce the limits of the nominated property to include only the Victoria Falls National Park, the northern half of Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park and a small portion of the riverine strip of Zambezi National Park in order to better concentrate on core features of the Falls area and the downstream gorges. \n The Committee requested the Secretariat to encourage Zambia and Zimbabwe to continue to consult together on this matter in cooperation with IUCN to reach agreement on final boundaries. The Committee requested Zambia and Zimbabwe to report back to the Committee on this matter at the next session of the Bureau in June 1990. \n &nbsp;
