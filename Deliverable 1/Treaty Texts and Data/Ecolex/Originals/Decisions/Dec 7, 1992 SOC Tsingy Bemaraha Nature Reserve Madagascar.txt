Tsingy Bemaraha Nature Reserve (Madagascar)  \n The Committee was concerned with the information reported by the Representative of IUCN concerning the disruption of conservation activities due to shortage of supplies in, and transport to, this site which is situated in a remote part of Madagascar. The Committee noted that the World Heritage Fund has provided to this site US$20,000 for the purchase of equipment and an additional US$20,000 for a management seminar during 1992. The Committee instructed the Centre to contact the Malagasy authorities and request a state of conservation report for this World Heritage site and a progress report on the expenditure of funds provided in 1992. \n &nbsp;
