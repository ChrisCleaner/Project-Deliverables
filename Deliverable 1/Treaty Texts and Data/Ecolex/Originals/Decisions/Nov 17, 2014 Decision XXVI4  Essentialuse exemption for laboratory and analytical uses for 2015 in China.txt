To encourage that party, which has applied for an exemption, to complete the revision of its relevant national standard and to ensure that a revised national standard is brought into force as soon as possible, with a view to ensuring a smooth transition to a method that does not use ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances;   2. To authorize the level of consumption for 2015 necessary to satisfy essential uses of carbon tetrachloride for the testing of oil, grease and total petroleum hydrocarbons in water, as specified in the annex to the present decision;   Annex   Essential-use authorizations for 2015 for carbon tetrachloride for testing of oil, grease and total petroleum hydrocarbons in water   (Metric tonnes)        Party     2015        China   80
