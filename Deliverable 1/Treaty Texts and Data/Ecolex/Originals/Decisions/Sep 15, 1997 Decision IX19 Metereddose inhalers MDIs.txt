The  Ninth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. IX/19:      To note with appreciation the interim report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) pursuant to decision VIII/12;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to continue its work and submit the final report to the Tenth Meeting of the Parties, through the Open-ended Working Group, taking into account the approach indicated in paragraph 5 of decision VIII/12 and the comments made during the fifteenth and sixteenth meetings of the Open-ended Working Group and the Ninth Meeting of the Parties;   To note the expectation of TEAP and its relevant Technical Options Committee that it remains possible that the major part of the MDI transition may occur in non-Article 5 countries by the year 2000 and there will be minimal need for CFCs for metered-dose inhalers by 2005, however, at this point in time there are still many variables and an exact time-scale is not possible to predict with certainty;   To note the concerns of some non-Article 5 Parties that they may not be able to convert as soon as they would like unless their independent MDI manufacturers are able to license non-CFC technologies;   To require non-Article 5 Parties submitting essential-use nominations for CFCs for MDIs for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to present to the Ozone Secretariat an initial national or regional transition strategy by 31 January 1999 for circulation to all Parties. Where possible, non-Article 5 Parties are encouraged to develop and submit to the Secretariat an initial transition strategy by 31 January 1998. In preparing a transition strategy, non-Article 5 Parties should take into consideration the availability and price of treatments for asthma and COPD in countries currently importing CFC MDIs.
