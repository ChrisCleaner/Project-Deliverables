Lake District&nbsp;  \n  422Rev  \n  United Kingdom  \n At the request of the authorities of the United Kingdom, the Committee re-examined the nomination of the Lake District to the World Heritage List as a cultural property, based on a recommendation by ICOMOS that it be so included. The Committee discussed this case in detail and, although many members showed great interest in including this property, no consensus could be reached. The Committee felt that it did not have sufficiently clear criteria to allow it to rule on this type of property. It was recalled that the lack of appropriate criteria for the examination of cultural landscapes had been a concern of the Committee for several years. The Committee therefore asked the Secretariat to develop such a criterion or criteria and to submit this proposal to the Bureau at its fifteenth session. This will enable the Committee to consider adopting this criterion or criteria at its next session and to examine the nomination of this property. \n &nbsp;
