Property:  Pyr\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9es - Mont Perdu  \n Id. N\xc2\xb0:  773 Bis  \n State Party:  France   / Spain  \n The Committee noted the comment by ICOMOS that the small extension proposed by France is a valuable contribution to the overall cultural landscape. IUCN informed the Bureau that the existing Pyr\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9es - Mount Perdu (France/Spain) World Heritage site was inscribed under natural  criteria (i)  and  (iii) . The proposed extension would not meet any natural criteria on its own. However, the extension has comparable scenic and geomorphological values to the existing site. IUCN noted concerns as to whether the legal basis is sufficient for long term protection, as indicated in the original IUCN evaluation. IUCN noted that the value of the area lies in its significance as a cultural landscape. \n The Committee decided to extend the existing World Heritage site to include the area of 550 ha (1,8 % of the World Heritage area) in the upper Valley of H\xc3\xa9as.
