The  Fourth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. IV/30:      to request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel:     to evaluate alternative substances and technologies to the application for HCFCs as refrigerant and as insulation gas in rigid foam;   to identify other applications for HCFCs, if any, where other more environmentally suitable alternatives or technologies are not available; and   to submit its findings to the Open-ended Working Group of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol no later than 31 March 1994;     to request the Open-ended Working Group to consider the report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel with respect to HCFCs; to consider the possible need for specific provisions for the implementation of the regulation on the applications for HCFCs, taking into account the special circumstances of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol; and to make any appropriate recommendations for consideration by the Parties at their Meeting in 1994 and following subsequent reviews taking place under Article 6 of the Protocol;   to ensure that, notwithstanding the new status of HCFCs as controlled substances, the incremental costs to Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol of making the transition from CFCs to HCFCs consistent with the regulation on the applications for HCFCs will continue to be met by the Fund and to request the Executive Committee to function in the light of this decision;   to request the Executive Committee to estimate, on an ongoing basis, the amount of HCFCs required by Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol and to recommend the methods of meeting such needs in full, simultaneously with the exercise to estimate the amounts of controlled substances needed, as well as to estimate the production available to meet those needs, as requested by the Open-ended Working Group at its seventh meeting.
