The  First Extraordinary Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. Ex.I/5:     Acknowledging  with appreciation the important and valuable work undertaken so far by the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee,    Reaffirming  the need for the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee to sustain an optimum level of expertise to be able to address diverse types of alternatives to methyl bromide and the desirability of having a reasonable term of membership of the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee to ensure continuity;    Noting  decision XIII/11, which requests the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to engage suitably qualified agricultural economists to assist in reviewing nominations,    Recognizing  the desirability of ensuring that some members of the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee have knowledge of alternatives that are used in commercial practice, and practical experience in technology transfer and deployment,    Recognizing  the need to strengthen the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee and to enhance the transparency and efficiency of the Committee\xe2\x80\x99s process relating to the evaluation of nominations for critical-use exemptions,    Noting  the terms of reference for the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its technical options committees adopted at the Eighth Meeting of the Parties,    Mindful  that those terms of reference state that the overall goal is to achieve a representation of about 50 per cent for Article 5 Parties and noting that current Article 5 representation within the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee is only about 30 per cent,    Recalling  decision XV/54 on categories of assessment to be used by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel when assessing critical uses of methyl bromide,     To establish a process to review the working procedures and terms of reference of the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee as they relate to the evaluation of nominations for critical use exemptions;

  The criteria and procedure for selecting the experts, including ensuring a balance between experts from Article 5 and non-Article 5 Parties, pursuant to the qualification requirements as set forth in subparagraph (e) above;   Further guidance on the application of the criteria set forth in decision IX/6;   The modalities for the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee to submit annual work plans to the Meeting of the Parties;

  That the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee should continue to assess the nominations as \xe2\x80\x9crecommended\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cnot recommended\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunable to assess\xe2\x80\x9d.   That the reports of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee, to be published following those bodies\xe2\x80\x99 initial assessment of nominations submitted in 2004 and following the subsequent assessment of any additional information submitted by nominating Parties, should include:     If the Panel and Committee do not recommend any part of a nomination, a clear description of the nominating Party\xe2\x80\x99s request for an exemption and of the reasons why the Panel and Committee did not accept it, including references to the relevant studies, wherever available, used as the basis for such a decision;   If the Panel and Committee require additional information, a clear description of the information required.
