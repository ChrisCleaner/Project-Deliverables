VII.22 Everglades National Park (United States of America)   \n The Committee recalled that at its last session (Merida, 1996), it noted significant progress made with regard to acquisition of land, refinement of ecological indicators, and generous Federal and State allocations of financial and human resources, but decided to retain this site in the List of World Heritage in Danger due to continued prevalence of threats. In response to the Committee\'s call to the State Party to share knowledge and experience gained through the restorative effort, the Park authorities convened an international seminar, in November 1997, to which all western hemisphere World Heritage site managers were invited. \n The Centre informed the Committee that a site monitoring report on the Everglades National Park was provided by the State Party on 25 November 1997, which indicated progress in the organization, planning and implementation of the ecosystem restoration projects in the region since the last report reviewed by the Committee in December 1996. In addition, significant amounts for ecological research and the purchase of land were made available by the Government. \n After discussing whether the site could be removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger, the Committee noted that the Delegate of the United States of America indicated that the site is still under threat despite significant progress made. The Committee congratulated the Government of the United States on its progress and commitment and decided to retain Everglades National Park in the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
