The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-11/35.COM/7B, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  33 COM 7B.127  adopted at its 33rd session (Seville, 2009), \n 3.  Acknowledges  the completion of the "Tower of London Local Setting Study", however,  expresses great concern  that this study only addresses individual views and a very narrow local setting, while the overall setting of the Tower in relation to the Outstanding Universal Value has not been defined and provided with protection in line with Decision  33 COM 7B.127  adopted by the Committee at its 33rd session (Seville, 2009); \n 4.  Considers  that the incremental developments around the Tower over the past five years have impacted adversely its visual integrity;    \n 5.  Requests  the State Party to evaluate the impact of proposed changes to the visual setting of the property on its Outstanding Universal Value, and to develop and apply effective mechanisms for the protection of the setting as a matter of urgency;    \n 6.  Also requests  the State Party to refrain from approving new construction projects in the vicinity of the property without assessing their potential impact on the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n 7.  Further requests  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre/ICOMOS reactive monitoring mission to the property to discuss with national and local authorities the overall situation of the property with regard to the state of conservation of the site in its urban context and how current and proposed construction projects in its neighbourhood may affect the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, and how appropriate protection for its setting may be put in place for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 36th session in 2012; \n 8.  Requests furthermore  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2012 , a report on the state of conservation of the property and on the steps taken to implement all the decisions of the Committee, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 36th session in 2012.
