The Bureau urged the State Party to keep the Committee informed about the proposed expansion of the industrial salt production project and to ensure the integrity of the site. \n The Delegate of Mexico informed the Bureau that in July 1994 the ESSA Salt Mining Company submitted to the National Institute of Ecology an environmental impact study proposal to extend its installations. This proposal was refused by the National Institute of Ecology (INE) in February 1995. On 23 June 1995 the ESSA Company expressed interest in submitting a new study for evaluation by the INE. \n In 26 February 1996, INE created a Committee comprising seven national and foreign experts, which held a first meeting in March 1996, participated in a public conference attended by nearly 300 persons and presented 42 documents to define aspects to be included in the new environmental impact study. \n The Minister of the Environment, Natural Resources and Fish (SEMARNAP), has indicated, through the National Institute of Ecology, that the proposal could only be authorized on the understanding that it respects the legislation and the ecological standards in force.
