The Bureau took note of the report on missions undertaken in December 1995 and January 1996 by the Chairman of the Committee, UNESCO and ICOMOS regarding proposed construction developments endangering the cultural landscape of this World Heritage site. \n The Representative of ICOMOS informed the Bureau that the City of Potsdam had invited ICOMOS to advise on the possible extension of the site as well as on its management. \n The Bureau expressed its serious concern about urban development plans in Potsdam, particularly the "Potsdam Centre" project, that could directly or indirectly affect the values of the World Heritage site. The Bureau requested the Secretariat to transmit its concern to the German authorities. The Bureau furthermore invited the authorities to consider the extension of the World Heritage site in order to include the Russische Kolonie/ Kapellenberg/Pfingstberg and the corridor linking these sites to the already inscribed site of Sanssouci.
