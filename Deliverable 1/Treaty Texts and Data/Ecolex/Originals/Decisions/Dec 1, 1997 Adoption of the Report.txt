XVII.1  The Rapporteur presented the draft report of the session to the Committee and thanked the Secretariat for their support in its preparation. Following the examination of the report, the Committee adopted it with the amendments noted and received in written form during its debate. \n  XVII.2  The Delegate of Niger regretted that due to his late arrival he was not able to participate in the discussions on the state of conservation of properties. In referring to paragraph VII.20 concerning Air and T&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; Reserve (Niger), he informed the Committee that a meeting between the Local Management Committee and the CNRS took place on 28 November 1997. At that meeting the possibility of removing the site from the List of World Heritage in Danger had been discussed. The authorities of Niger and IUCN (through its onsite project) agreed that it would be too early to remove the site from the List of World Heritage in Danger. He reiterated his Government\'s request for a monitoring mission to be organized in 1998. \n &nbsp;
