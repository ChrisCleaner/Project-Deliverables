The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Documents WHC-11/35.COM/8B and WHC-11/35.COM/INF.8B2, \n 2.  Refers  the nomination of the  Trinational Sangha, Congo, Cameroon and Central African Republic ,   back to the States Parties   in order to allow them to: \n a) Enhance the justification for inscription of the property, including the conditions of integrity and comparative analysis in relation to each criterion, with the assistance of IUCN and the World Heritage Centre as required, \n b) Increase further the involvement and representation of local and indigenous communities in the nomination process and future management, in line with stated commitments, in order to fully recognize the rich tapestry of cultural and spiritual values associated with the property, and in recognition of contributions by local and indigenous communities, such as local knowledge and adapted resource use practices, with the advice of IUCN and the World Heritage Centre as required, \n c) Consider potential nomination of adjacent areas where traditional local resource use is permitted, in particular the R&eacute;serve sp&eacute;ciale de Dzanga-Sangha, and the concessions (Unit&eacute;s Foresti&egrave;res d\'Am&eacute;nagement) adjacent to Lob&eacute;k&eacute; and Nouabal&eacute;-Ndoki National Parks, in either a revised boundary of the nomination and/or as recognised buffer zones as part of an integrated landscape approach, noting that important values are located outside the currently nominated area, that sustainable resource use is compatible with World Heritage status and also that the future integrity of Trinational Sangha will depend on the balance between resource use and conservation at the landscape level, \n d) Evaluate the potential application of cultural criteria to the nominated property (i.e. nomination as a mixed property), taking into account the rich indigenous cultural heritage of the area, \n e) Further harmonize objectives and guidelines for the various conservation initiatives and management planning, including tourism planning among the three States Parties, \n f) Further improve coordination between ministries and sectors to ensure adequate and consistent land use planning and law enforcement, \n g) Establish and implement clear policies for small-scale mining in order to prevent mining within or affecting the nominated area, \n h) Ensure high environmental and social standards for all adjacent concessions by integrating a corresponding commitment into the \'cahier des charges\' for timber concessionaires, \n i) Increase funding support for the property and ensure full support to the Trust Fund and to the retention of tourism revenues for conservation and community development purposes; \n 3.&nbsp; Commends  the States Parties on their establishment of a network of functioning protected areas in the property and the surrounding landscape which appear to be providing a balanced approach to conservation and development, in particular the recognition of local and indigenous rights and need for access to natural resources; \n 4.&nbsp; Further commends  the States Parties on their transboundary approach to conservation and management efforts.
