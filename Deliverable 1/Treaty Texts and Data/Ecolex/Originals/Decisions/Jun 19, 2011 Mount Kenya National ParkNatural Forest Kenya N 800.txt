The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-11/35.COM/7B, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  33 COM 7B.3 , adopted at its 33rd session (Seville, 2009), \n 3.  Commends  the State Party\'s progress in addressing the key recommendations of the 2008 mission, and in particular the adoption and implementation of the Mount Kenya Management Plan 2010-2020 and the completion of the Environmental Impact Assessment for the first construction phase of the fence intended to minimise community-wildlife conflicts; \n 4.  Requests  the State Party to fully implement the remaining recommendations including the demarcation of the boundary between forestry plantation zones and natural forest, the establishment of wildlife corridors in order to mitigate any potential adverse impacts from the fence on the property\'s wildlife populations and the adoption of a management agreement between the Kenya Wildlife Service and the Kenya Forestry Service; \n 5.  Notes with concern  the reports on rising levels of illegal logging and poaching within the property, and the challenges faced by the Kenya Wildlife Service with regards to management financing and the relatively small number of rangers patrolling the property; \n 6.  Remains   concerned  about the long-term impacts of climate change on the property, and  encourages  the State Party to resubmit a proposal for its extension in order to preserve as much lower altitude undisturbed forest and wildlife corridors as possible, and increase its resilience against climate change; \n 7.  Notes  the ongoing collaboration between Parks Canada and the Kenya Wildlife Service on training in support of Kenya\'s conservation efforts, and  also encourages  both State Parties to explore opportunities for capacity building initiatives in Mount Kenya, including with regards to the proposed extension; \n 8.  Also requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2013 , a report on the state of conservation of the property and on the progress made in implementing the recommendations of the 2008 mission, developing wildlife corridors, and the status of poaching, logging and management financing, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 37th session in 2013.
