Redwood   National Park (United States of America)  \n The Committee was informed of a proposal of the California Department of Transportation (COT) regarding a road realignment of the US Highway 101 in Del Norte County which will result in the removal of about 200 trees in this World Heritage site. Although COT has prepared an environmental impact statement (EIS), the Committee was informed that the EIS made no mention of the World Heritage status of the area. The Committee therefore requested the Centre to write to the American authorities and suggest that the COT recognize the international significance of this site and hence the special consideration it should receive vis-a-vis potential impacts of the road re-alignment project. The Committee requested the Centre and IUCN to report on this matter at the next session of the Bureau. \n &nbsp;
