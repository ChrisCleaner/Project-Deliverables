After having taken note of the report made by World Heritage Centre consultant, the Bureau commended the State Party and the cooperating governments, institutions and agencies for their joint effort to conserve and rehabilitate the Vilnius Historic Centre, and requested to be kept informed on the progress made. The Bureau also recommended to the State Party to accelerate the operationalization of the Agency for the Revitalization of Old Vilnius (OTRA) as a key element for the revitalization of the Historic Centre. It called upon international and bilateral donors to further discussions with the Lithuanian authorities with a view to initiating cooperative agreements along the lines endorsed at the donors\' meeting which was held in February 1997 in Vilnius.
