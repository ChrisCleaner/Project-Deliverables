VII.25 Royal Palaces of Abomey (Benin)  \n In accordance with the recommendation adopted by the Bureau at its eighteenth session in July 1995, the Committee was informed of a mission organized by the World Heritage Centre to Abomey to complete and update the nomination documents and prepare a state of conservation report. The mission recommended to the authorities concerned: \n 1) to identify more precisely the boundaries of the site and enhance the respect of the buffer zone which should take into account the enclosing walls and the old entrance doors; \n 2) establish a global conservation and management plan which should take account of the fragility of the material and immaterial structures; \n 3) foresee a management structure under the authority of the Cultural Heritage Directorate and in which the partners involved in the enhancement of the site, notably representatives of the Royal families and the development associations would be participating. \n The Committee took note of the recommendations contained in the report and commended the Benin authorities and invited them to prepare, in cooperation with CRATerre - EAG and ICCROM, a conservation and management plan to be presented to the World Heritage Committee at its twentieth session (December 1997) at the latest. The Committee decided to maintain this site on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
