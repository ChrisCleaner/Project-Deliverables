A&iuml;r-Tenere Natural Nature Reserves (Niger)  \n The Committee was informed that the wildlife in this site has been decimated due to the consequences of the conflict between the Resistance Army of the Tuaregs and Government forces. Hence, the Committee was encouraged to note that the warring parties had signed a peace accord on 9 October 1994. The implementation of this accord by the new Government is however an essential prerequisite for the conservation of this site. The Committee requested the Centre to write to the new Government, recalling Niger\'s international obligations under the Convention to safeguard the A&iuml;r and Tenere Reserves and encourage them to implement the peace accord. The Committee also wished that the Centre inform the Niger authorities that the continuous implementation of the peace accord will permit an assessment of the current status of wildlife populations and the resumption of the IUCN/WWF Project, funded by Denmark and Switzerland. \n &nbsp;
