Australian East Coast Temperate and Sub-Tropical Rain Forest Parks  \n  368  \n  Australia    \n  N(i)(ii)   \n The Australian authorities, by letter of 9 October 1986 to the Secretariat, agreed to the two conditions recommended by the Bureau for the inscription of the property on the World Heritage List. The first of these was to exclude the Mt. Dromedary Flora Reserve from the nominated areas and the second concerned the changing of the name of this property. The name given above and suggested by the Australian authorities was considered appropriate by the Committee. In relation to the Bureau\'s suggestion regarding the desirability to extend this property to include contiguous rain forests in the state of Queensland, the Australian authorities informed the Committee, through the Secretariat, that they do not anticipate making any immediate proposals to this effect. IUCN noted that this suggestion o f the Bureau was not a prerequisite for the inscription o f this property on the World Heritage List. The World Heritage Committee, while inscribing this property on the World Heritage List, noted the IUCN observation that future modifications to the boundaries of this natural property to include other small patches of rain forests might be possible. \n &nbsp;
