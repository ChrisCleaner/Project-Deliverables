The  Fourteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XIV/2  to accept the application of Armenia to be listed as a developing country operating under Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol, taking into account its difficult economic situation, its classification as a developing country by the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme and its low per capita consumption of ozone-depleting substances, on the understanding that the process for ratification of the London Amendment in Armenia must be completed before any assistance from the Multilateral Fund can be rendered to the Party.
