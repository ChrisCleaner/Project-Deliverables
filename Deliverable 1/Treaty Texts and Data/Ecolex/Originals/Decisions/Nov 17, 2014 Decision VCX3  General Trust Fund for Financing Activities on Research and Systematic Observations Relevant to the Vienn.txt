Recalling  decision VI/2, by which the Conference of the Parties established the General Trust Fund for Financing Activities on Research and Systematic Observations Relevant to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, and noting that the current life of the Trust Fund will expire at the end of 2015,    Noting with appreciation  the contributions to the Trust Fund by several parties and the joint efforts of the World Meteorological Organization and the Ozone Secretariat in the implementation of the activities funded by the Trust Fund since it became operational in 2003,    Noting  that important activities, including calibrations, inter-comparisons and relevant training, have been implemented successfully under the Trust Fund to date,    Noting with concern , however, that the resources available in the Trust Fund are not sufficient to enable substantial and sustainable improvements to be made to the global ozone observing system,    Noting  that the coming decade is a crucial time during which the status of the recovery of the ozone layer will become clearer, but that such clarity will be dependent on continued high\xe2\x80\x91quality observations ,     Aware  that improvements in ozone observations should take into account the existing strong and intricate linkages between ozone and climate, and carry out relevant observations and analyses for both ozone and climate wherever possible,    Noting  that the Ozone Research Managers, at their ninth meeting, in 2014, reviewed the status and activities of the Trust Fund, considered options for the way forward for the Fund and provided specific recommendations on the matter,   1. To request the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme to extend the life of the General Trust Fund for Financing Activities on Research and Systematic Observations Relevant to the Vienna Convention up to 31 December 2020;   2. To request the Ozone Secretariat to coordinate with the World Meteorological Organization to establish a small advisory committee for the Trust Fund, which would convene electronically or in the margins of other relevant meetings, consisting of not more than 10 members, including two co-chairs of the Scientific Assessment Panel, the two co-chairs of the Ozone Research Managers, one representative of the Ozone Secretariat and up to five scientists and experts in ozone observations, and one representative of the World Meteorological Organization as an observer, striving for equitable geographical and gender representation, with a mandate:   (a) To develop a long-term strategy and implementation objectives and priorities in the light of the four overarching goals identified by the Ozone Research Managers at their ninth meeting;   (b) To develop a short-term action plan that takes into account the most urgent needs of the Global Ozone Observing System and which will make the best possible use of the resources available in the Trust Fund;   (c) To ensure quality control of the individual project proposals developed under the Trust Fund, striving for regional balance in the projects supported by the Fund and identifying possibilities for complementary funding to maximize its resources;   3. To request the Ozone Secretariat to continue inviting parties, and relevant international organizations as appropriate, to make financial and/or in-kind contributions towards well\xe2\x80\x91defined and well-budgeted project proposals developed under the Trust Fund;   4. To request the Ozone Secretariat to report to the Conference of the Parties at its eleventh meeting on the operation of, contributions to and expenditures from the Trust Fund and on the activities funded by the Trust Fund since its inception, as well as on the activities of the advisory committee;
