The World Heritage Committee,   1.  Inscribes  the Champaner-Pavagadh Archaeological Park, India, on the World Heritage List on the basis of cultural criteria (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi):    Criterion (iii):  The Champaner-Pavagadh Archaeological Park with its ancient architecture, temples and special water retaining installations together with its religious, military and agricultural structures, dating back to the regional Capital City built by Mehmud Begda in the 16th century, represents cultures which have disappeared.    Criterion (iv):  The structures represent a perfect blend of Hindu-Moslem architecture, mainly in the Great Mosque (Jami Masjid), which was a model for later mosque architecture in India. This special style comes from the significant period of regional sultanates.    Criterion (v):  The Champaner-Pavagadh Archaeological Park is an outstanding example of a very short living Capital, making the best use of its setting, topography and natural features. It is quite vulnerable due to abandonment, forest takeover and modern life.    Criterion (vi):  The Champaner-Pavagadh Archaeological Park is a place of worship and continuous pilgrimage for Hindu believers.   2.  Requests  the Indian authorities to monitor the implementation of the Management Plan and submit a report by 1 February 2005, on its operation for the consideration of the 29th session of the World Heritage Committee in 2005.
