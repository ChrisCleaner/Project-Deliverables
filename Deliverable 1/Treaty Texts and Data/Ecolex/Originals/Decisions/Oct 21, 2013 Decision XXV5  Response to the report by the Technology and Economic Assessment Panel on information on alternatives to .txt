Noting with appreciation  volume 2 of the 2012 task force progress report, which responded to decision XXIII/9, and volume 2 of the 2013 progress report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, which responded to decision XXIV/7,    Noting  the release of the contribution of Working Group I to the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cClimate change 2013: the physical science basis\xe2\x80\x9d,   1. To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, in consultation with external experts if necessary, to prepare a report for consideration by the Open-ended Working Group at its thirty-fourth meeting and an updated report to be submitted to the Twenty-Sixth Meeting of the Parties that would:   (a) Provide an update on information on alternatives to ozone-depleting substances in various sectors and subsectors, and differentiating between parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and parties not so operating, considering regional differences, and assessing whether such alternatives are:   (i) Commercially available;   (ii) Technically proven;   (iii) Environmentally sound;   (iv) Energy efficient;   (v) Economically viable and cost-effective;   (vi) Suitable for regions with high ambient temperatures, in particular considering the refrigeration and air-conditioning sector and their use in high-urban-density cities;   (vii) Suitable for safe uses, in particular considering their potential flammability or toxicity, and their suitability for use in densely populated urban areas, and describing potential limitations of their use;   (viii) Easily used;   (b) Estimate current and future demand for alternatives to ozone-depleting substances, taking into account increased demand, in particular in the refrigeration and air-conditioning sectors and in parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5;   (c) Assess, differentiating between parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and those not so operating, the economic costs and implications, and environmental benefits of various scenarios of avoiding high-global-warming-potential alternatives to ozone-depleting substances, where such avoidance is possible, considering the list in subparagraph (a) of the present decision;   (d) Request the Scientific Assessment Panel, in liaison with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to provide information from the contribution of Working Group 1 to the fifth assessment report on the main climate metrics, considering the updated information provided in paragraph 1 (a) of the present decision;   2. To convene a workshop, back to back with the thirty-fourth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group, to continue discussions on hydrofluorocarbon management, taking into account the information requested in the present decision and previous reports provided in response to decisions XXIII/9 and XXIV/7;   3. To encourage parties to provide to the Secretariat, on a voluntary basis, information on their implementation of paragraph 9 of decision XIX/6, including information on available data, policies and initiatives pertaining to the promotion of a transition from ozone-depleting substances that minimize environmental impact wherever the required technologies are available, and to request the Secretariat to compile any submissions received for consideration by the Open-ended Working Group at its thirty-fourth meeting;   4. To request the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund to consider the information provided in the report on additional information on alternatives to ozone-depleting substances prepared by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel pursuant to decision XXIV/7 and other related reports, with a view to considering whether additional demonstration projects to validate whether low-global\xe2\x80\x91warming\xe2\x80\x91potential alternatives and technologies, together with additional activities to maximize the climate benefits in the hydrochlorofluorocarbon production sector, would be useful in assisting parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 in further minimizing the environmental impact of the hydrochlorofluorocarbon phase-out;
