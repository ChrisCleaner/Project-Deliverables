Recognizing  the value of developing a strategic view on the use of methyl bromide for quarantine and pre-shipment purposes and the importance of enhancing the data available for that purpose,     Mindful  that consistent reporting on methyl bromide consumption for quarantine and pre\xe2\x80\x91shipment purposes would facilitate monitoring and review of quarantine and pre-shipment consumption and uses,     Recalling  decision XI/13, and in particular its paragraph 3, requiring each party to provide the Secretariat with statistical data on the amount of methyl bromide used annually for quarantine and pre\xe2\x80\x91shipment applications,    Recalling also  the recommendation of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures of the International Plant Protection Convention on the replacement or reduction of the use of methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure   [2]   , adopted in 2008, and decisions XX/6 and XXI/10, encouraging parties to the Montreal Protocol to implement that recommendation,     Recalling  the definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cquarantine\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpre-shipment\xe2\x80\x9d set forth in decisions VII/5 and XI/12 and noting the importance of applying them consistently,     Recalling  that under specification 16 alternatives to methyl bromide use for phytosanitary purposes approved by national plant protection organizations are to be submitted under the International Plant Protection Convention,   1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To encourage parties to follow the recommendation of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures of the International Plant Protection Convention that data on current usage of methyl bromide as a phytosanitary measure should be accurately recorded and collated, including information on the quantities of methyl bromide used in kilograms, a description of the articles fumigated, where appropriate, whether the use was on imported or exported commodities and target pests;    2. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To invite parties in a position to do so, on a voluntary basis, to submit information to the Ozone Secretariat by 31 March 2013 on:    (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The amount of methyl bromide used to comply with phytosanitary requirements of destination countries;    (b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Phytosanitary requirements for imported commodities that must be met through the use of methyl bromide and to request the Secretariat to forward the information to the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel;    3.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To urge parties to comply with the reporting requirements of Article 7 and to provide data on the amount of methyl bromide used for quarantine and pre-shipment applications annually and to invite parties in a position to do so, on a voluntary basis, to supplement such data by reporting to the Secretariat information on methyl bromide uses recorded and collated pursuant to the recommendation of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures;    4.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To encourage parties to consider avoiding requiring multiple treatments of consignments with methyl bromide unless a risk of an infestation with a pest has been identified;    5.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to provide, for consideration by the Open-ended Working group at its thirty-second meeting, a concise report that:    (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Summarizes data submitted under article 7 of the Montreal Protocol on a regional basis, providing analysis of trends in that data;

   6. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to provide, for consideration by the Open-ended Working group at its thirty-third meeting, a concise report based on the information provided in accordance with paragraph 2 above;    7.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Secretariat to consult the Secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention on how to ensure and improve the exchange of information on methyl bromide uses and alternative treatments between the Convention and Montreal Protocol bodies and on the systems available to facilitate access to such information by national authorities and private organizations, and to report to the Open-ended Working group at its thirty-second meeting on the outcome of such consultation and on cooperation in general between the Convention and the Protocol;
