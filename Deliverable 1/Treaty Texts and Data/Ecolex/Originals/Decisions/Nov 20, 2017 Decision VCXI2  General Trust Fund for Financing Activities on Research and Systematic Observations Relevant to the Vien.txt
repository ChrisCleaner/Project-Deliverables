Recalling  decision VI/2, by which the Conference of the Parties established the General Trust Fund for Financing Activities on Research and Systematic Observations Relevant to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, and noting that the current life of the Trust Fund will expire at the end of 2019,    Noting with appreciation  the contributions to the Trust Fund by several parties and the joint efforts of the World Meteorological Organization and the Secretariat in the implementation of the activities funded from the Trust Fund since it became operational in 2003,    Noting  that important activities, including calibrations, inter-comparisons and relevant training, have been implemented successfully under the Trust Fund to date,    Noting with great concern , however, that the resources available in the Trust Fund are not sufficient to enable substantial and sustainable improvements to be made to the global ozone observing system,    Noting  that the coming decade remains a crucial time during which the status of the recovery of the ozone layer will become clearer, but that such clarity will be dependent on continued high\xe2\x80\x91quality observations,    Aware  that improvements in ozone observations should take into account the existing strong and intricate linkages between ozone and climate and of the need to carry out relevant observations and analyses for both ozone and climate wherever possible,    Noting with appreciation  the work of the Advisory Committee of the Trust Fund, including on the long-term strategy and short-term plan of action for the Trust Fund prepared for consideration by the Conference of the Parties pursuant to decision X/3,   1.
