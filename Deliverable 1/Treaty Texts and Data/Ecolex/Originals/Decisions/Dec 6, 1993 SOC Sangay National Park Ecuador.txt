Sangay   National Park (Ecuador) &nbsp; \n The Representative of IUCN recalled that the site was inscribed in 1983 and added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1992 due to threats from poachers, boundary encroachment and unplanned road construction. A field mission was conducted by IUCN\'s Office in Ecuador and the Committee discussed the proposed six-point action plan including the recommendation that an environmental impact assessment of the road construction be undertaken. The technical assistance request for Sangay National  Park   (US$ 28,500)  will be reviewed in the light of the findings of the IUCN field review. The Centre is requested to transmit the Committee\'s concerns about the impact of the new road to the authorities in Ecuador. \n &nbsp;
