VII.69 Archaeological sites of Bat, AI-Khutun and AI-Ayn (Oman)  \n On the occasion of a mission sent to Oman from 14 to 21 September 1996, UNESCO experts noted that several structures of the site of Bat are now protected by wire fence enclosures, but that several repairs and preventive measures should be taken. \n Having noted the Secretariat report on the state of conservation of the archaeological site of Bat, the Bureau thanked the Omani authorities for preserving the structures of the site and encouraged them to implement as quickly as possible the additional measures already foreseen: \n - repair of the fenced enclosures; \n - diversion of the course of the neighbouring  Wadi  which threatens the protection of the site; \n - discreet marking in-situ, by appropriate methods, 0f the position of the stones still in place in the walls; \n - reinforcement of the security guards to avoid the theft of the blocks of stone. \n &nbsp;
