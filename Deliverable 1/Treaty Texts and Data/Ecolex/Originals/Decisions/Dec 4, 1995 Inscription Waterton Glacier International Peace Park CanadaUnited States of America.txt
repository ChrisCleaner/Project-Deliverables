Waterton   Glacier International Peace Park     \n  354Rev  \n  Canada  /United States of America  \n  N(ii) (iii)   \n The committee took note of the evaluation presented by IUCN and that the site meets criteria (ii) and (iii) because of its distinctive climate, physiographic setting, mountain/prairie interface and tri-ocean hydrographical divide as well as its scenic values and the cultural importance of its International Peace Park designation. IUCN further recommended that a single "Biosphere Reserve" should be created from the three Biosphere Reserves already existing in the area. \n The Committee decided that the site be listed under criteria (ii) and (iii) and requested the World Heritage Centre to write to the states Parties with respect to the Biosphere Reserve proposal. In addition, the committee recommended that the site be eventually expanded to include the adjacent protected area in the Akamina/Kishinena. \n &nbsp;
