The Historic Centre of the City of Pienza  \n  789  \n  Italy    \n  C(i) (ii) (iv)  \n The Committee decided to inscribe the nominated property on the basis of cultural criteria (i), (ii) and (iv) considering that the site is of outstanding universal value as it represents the first application of the Renaissance Humanist concept of urban design, and as such occupies a seminal position in the development of the concept of the planned "ideal town" which was to play a significant role in subsequent urban development in Italy and beyond. The application of this principle in Pienza, and in particular in the group of buildings around the central square, resulted in a masterpiece of human creative genius. \n The Committee also congratulated Italy for having chosen rather than a selective lecture of the Convention, a global and diversified approach reflected by nominations illustrating all heritage categories and bearing witness to the link and interaction of cultures over a long period. \n &nbsp;
