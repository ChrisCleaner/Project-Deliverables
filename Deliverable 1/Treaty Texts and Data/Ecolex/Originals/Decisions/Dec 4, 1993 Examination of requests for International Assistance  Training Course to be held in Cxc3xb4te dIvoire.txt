A. NATURAL HERITAGE  \n   A.2&nbsp; Requests for which the Bureau formulated a recommendation to the Committee   \n  A.2.2 Training  \n  A.2.2.2 Training Course to be held in C&ocirc;te d\'Ivoire  \n The Bureau  discussed  a request for US$40,000 for the organization of a training course provided by the \'\'Ecole nationale du genie rural, des eaux et des forets" (ENGREF). \n There was considerable discussion about this course. The Bureau  raised concerns  about the cost effectiveness of the programme and the results received in relation to the future management of World Heritage sites. While ENGREF had responded to all of the requests made by the sixteenth session of the Committee, it was felt that the details submitted were not sufficient to make a decision at this time. The Bureau  requested  the Centre to contact the course director for further information. If this information is received in time, the request will be brought forward to the Committee. \n The Bureau  noted  IUCN\'s comments that they had prepared a concept paper on training in 1983. It was suggested that this paper be reviewed and could form the basis for the development of a training strategy. It was  decided  that if further information was received from the course Director, the proposal could be reviewed by the full Committee. \n &nbsp;
