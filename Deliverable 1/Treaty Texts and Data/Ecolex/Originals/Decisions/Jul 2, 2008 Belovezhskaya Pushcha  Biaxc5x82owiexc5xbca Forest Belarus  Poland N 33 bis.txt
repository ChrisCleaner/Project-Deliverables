The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-08/32.COM/7B , \n 2.  Recalling  Decisions  30 COM 7B.20  and  31 COM 7B.30 , adopted at its 30th (Vilnius, 2006) and 31st (Christchurch, 2007) sessions respectively, \n 3.  Notes with concern  that a large part of the property on the Belarusian side might not have been managed according to World Heritage standards given that the State Party considered that only the strictly protected zone of the Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park was inscribed on the World Heritage List, not the whole National Park; \n 4.  Reiterates its request  to both States Parties to ensure that the management of the property and surrounding areas does not adversely impact on the values and integrity of the property, and to continue their efforts to implement the recommendations of the joint 2004 World Heritage Centre / IUCN mission, as confirmed by the 2007 recommendations of the European Diploma Group of Specialists; \n 5.  Requests  both States Parties to invite a joint World Heritage Centre / IUCN Reactive Monitoring mission to the property, preferably in September or October 2008, in order to: \n a) assess the state of conservation of the property and surrounding areas that are intended to be proposed as extensions to the property; \n b) resolve the boundary issue on the Belarusian side before the revision of the functional zoning of the national park is completed and obtain a map of the whole transboundary property; \n c) review progress made with the management plans for the national parks and make recommendations on the consideration of World Heritage requirements in them; and \n d) advise on the possibility to re-nominate the property under additional criteria, with extended and consolidated boundaries and with appropriate buffer zones; \n e) assist in reviewing the draft Statement for Outstanding Universal Value for the property prepared by the Periodic Reporting Meeting held in Wroclaw, Poland (September 2007) \n 6.  Also requests  both States Parties to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2009,  updated reports on the state of conservation of the property and on further progress made in implementing pending recommendations from the 2004 World Heritage Centre / IUCN mission, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 33rd session in 2009.
