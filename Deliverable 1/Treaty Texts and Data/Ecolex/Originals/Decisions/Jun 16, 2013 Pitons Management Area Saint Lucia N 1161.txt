The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.&nbsp;   Having examined   Document WHC-13/37.COM/7B.Add, \n 2.&nbsp;   Recalling   Decision   36 COM 7B.34   , adopted at its 36th&nbsp;session (Saint-Petersburg, 2012), \n 3.&nbsp;   Also recalling   the State Party&rsquo;s intervention at its 34th&nbsp;session (Brasilia, 2010), in which it committed to a strict moratorium on further development within the property, \n 4.&nbsp;   Further recalling   the repeatedly stated concerns by the World Heritage Committee that the property&rsquo;s Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) may already have been significantly, and potentially irreversibly, compromised by past developments within the property, \n 5.&nbsp;   Takes note   of the activities reported in the State Party\'s report on the state of conservation of the property, including commissioning the Limits of Acceptable Change study, and   welcomes   the efforts by the State Party to improve the protection and management of the property; \n 6.&nbsp;   Notes   the clear statement from the State Party that, through Cabinet Order No. 58, as approved on 28 January 2013, a full moratorium on all development in the property will be observed, and that &ldquo;all previous development approvals have lapsed, and none have been renewed&rdquo;; \n 7.&nbsp;   Considers   essential that the moratorium on all development remains fully in place and effective, across the whole extent of the property, until clear development control regulations are finalized to the satisfaction of the World Heritage Committee, and applied through the necessary legislative instruments, and based on the results of the Limits of Acceptable Change study; \n 8.&nbsp;   Also considers   that, should development once again be allowed to take place before this time, the integrity of the property would clearly be compromised, leading to consideration of the inclusion of the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger; \n 9.&nbsp;   Requests   the State Party, as construction may not have commenced, to not approve any additional developments until the Limits to Acceptable Change study, along with development regulations and guidelines, are completed and legally integrated into the development review process; \n 10.&nbsp; Also requests   the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by   1 February 2014   , a report on the state of conservation of the property, focusing specifically on progress in establishing an effective development control system, and confirming the effective and continued implementation on development within the property, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 38th session in 2014.
