Property:  Gunung   Mulu National Park    \n Id. N&deg;:  1013  \n State Party:  Malaysia    \n Criteria:  N (i) (ii) (iii) (iv)  \n The Committee inscribed the Gunung Mulu National Park under natural  criteria (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) . \n  Criteria (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) : The concentration of caves in Mulu\'s Melinau Formation with its geomorphic and structural characteristics is an outstanding feature which allows a greater understanding of Earth\'s history. The caves of Mulu are important for their classic features of underground geomorphology, demonstrating an evolutionary history of more than 1.5 million years. One of the world\'s finest examples of the collapse process in Karstic terrain can be also found. GMNP provides outstanding scientific opportunities to study theories on the origins of cave faunas. With its deeply-incised canyons, wild rivers, rainforest-covered mountains, spectacular limestone pinnacles, cave passages and decorations, Mulu has outstanding scenic values. GMNP also provides significant natural habitat for a wide range of plant and animal diversity both above and below ground. It is botanically-rich in species and high in endemism, including one of the richest sites in the world for palm species. \n IUCN also noted the positive response received from the authorities received concerning a number of issues raised at the twenty-fourth session of the Bureau and proposed that the authorities be encouraged to review the additions to the site for their World Heritage potential when the gazetting process is completed. \n The Observer of Malaysia stressed the commitment of the authorities to preserve the site. \n &nbsp;
