The Bureau was read a letter of appreciation received from the Director General of Tanzania National Parks dated 20 June 2000 in which the State Party informed the Centre that the Tanzania National Parks received safely the two vehicles provided by the twenty-third session of the Bureau (July, 1999) for Kilimanjaro and Serengeti National Parks.&nbsp; The letter said that the vehicles are being used for&nbsp; the management of the Kilimanjaro and Serengeti National Parks to improve the fire monitoring patrols, and resources such as the veterinary services, studies in quantity and quality of water for animals and ecological monitoring in general. This support for Serengeti as a vast park, has been a morale booster for the Park staff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Director General of the Tanzanian Park Agency thanked the World Heritage Centre, and the Bureau for this assistance. \n As regards the road to Ngorongoro, the Bureau noted that the Centre is in contact with the State Party to monitor progress in the process for investigating options available for the construction of an access road to Ngorongoro and that no new information has been received. \n The Observer of Tanzania thanked the World Heritage Centre for the support provided to his country, and assured the Bureau that Tanzania will communicate with the Centre concerning the construction of the road. \n Having been informed that IUCN understood that a feasibility study is underway in relation to the route of the road, the Bureau recommended that more information be sought from the State Party on this issue for the twenty-fourth extraordinary session of the Bureau.
