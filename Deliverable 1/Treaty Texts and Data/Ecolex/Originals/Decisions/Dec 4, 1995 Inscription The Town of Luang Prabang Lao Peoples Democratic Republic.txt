The Town of Luang Prabang  \n  479Rev.  \n  Lao People\'s Democratic Republic  \n  C(ii) (iv)   (v)  \n The Committee decided to inscribe this site on the World Heritage List on the basis of criteria (ii), (iv) and (v). Luang Prabang represents, to an exceptional extent, the successful fusion of the traditional architectural and urban structures and those of the European colonial rulers of the 19th and 20th centuries. Its unique townscape is remarkably well preserved, illustrating a key stage in the blending of two distinct cultural traditions. \n &nbsp;
