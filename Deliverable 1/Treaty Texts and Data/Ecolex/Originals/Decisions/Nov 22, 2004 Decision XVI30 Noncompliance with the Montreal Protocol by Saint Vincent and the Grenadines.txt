The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/30:      To note that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines ratified the Montreal Protocol and the London and Copenhagen amendments on 2 December 1996. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee in 1998. The Executive Committee has approved $166,019 from the Multilateral Fund to enable compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;   To note that, in accordance with decision XV/42 of the Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was requested to submit to the Implementation Committee a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance;   To note with appreciation the submission by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines of its plan of action, and to note also that, under the plan, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines specifically commits itself:     To reducing CFC consumption from 3.07 ODP tonnes in 2003 as follows:     To 2.15 ODP tonnes in 2004;   To 1.39 ODP tonnes in 2005;   To 0.83 ODP tonnes in 2006;   To 0.45 ODP tonnes in 2007;   To 0.22 ODP tonnes in 2008;   To 0.1 ODP tonnes in 2009;   To phasing out CFC consumption by 1 January 2010, as required under the Montreal Protocol, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To monitoring its existing system for licensing imports of ozone-depleting substances and its ban on imports of ozone-depleting-substances-using equipment, introduced in 2003;   To introducing an ozone-depleting substances quota system by the last quarter of 2004, which will become effective from 1 January 2005;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 3 above should enable Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to return to compliance by 2008, and to urge Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase-out of consumption of ozone-depleting substances in Annex A, group I (CFCs);   To monitor closely the progress of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of CFCs. To the degree that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Meeting of the Parties cautions Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that it fails to remain in compliance, the Meeting of the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of CFCs (that is, the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
