The Bureau took note of the reports from ICOMOS, the Secretariat and the Permanent Delegation of Sri Lanka. The Bureau expressed its deep concern over the terrorist bombing in the Sacred City of Kandy, and requested the Secretariat to appeal to the international community to assist the State Party to complete restoration work. Furthermore, in light of the increasing conflicts which threaten heritage sites around the world, the Bureau strongly encouraged the States Parties to the World Heritage Convention to keep abreast with new developments in the 1954 Hague Convention. The Bureau was informed that there is a diplomatic conference planned in 1999 to re-draft the  1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict,  which would protect cultural heritage at a non-international level. Finally, the Bureau requested the State Party to submit a report concerning the progress made in the restoration work undertaken, by 15 September 1998.
