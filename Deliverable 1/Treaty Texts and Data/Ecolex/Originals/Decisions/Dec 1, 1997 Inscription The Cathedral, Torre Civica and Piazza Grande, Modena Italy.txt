The Cathedral, Torre Civica and Piazza Grande, Modena  \n  827  \n  Italy     \n  C(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)  \n The Committee decided to inscribe this property on the basis of criteria (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), considering that the joint creation of Lanfranco and Wiligelmo is a masterpiece of human creative genius in which a new dialectical relationship between architecture and sculpture was created in Romanesque art. The Modena complex bears exceptional witness to the cultural traditions of the 12th century and is one of the best examples of an architectural complex where religious and civic values are combined in a medieval Christian town. \n &nbsp;
