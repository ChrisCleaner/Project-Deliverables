VII.37 Garamba National Park (Zaire)  \n The Committee recalled that due to the success of the safeguarding action of the northern white rhino population by the World Heritage Committee, IUCN, WWF, the Frankfurt Zoological Society and the Zaire authorities, the site was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1992. In April 1996, the Centre and IUCN received information on the poaching of two white rhinos. \n The Bureau at its twentieth extraordinary session took note of additional information provided by IUCN on the loss of three rangers killed at the site and information based on a detailed report provided by WWF and the IUCN Species Survival Commission. The Bureau recalled that it discussed at its twentieth session inscription on the List of World Heritage in Danger given the gravity of the situation. The Bureau took note that no commitment of the Zaire authorities for such listing had been obtained and no plan for corrective measures in conformity with the Operational Guidelines had been submitted. The Bureau also considered the serious situation in Zaire and the situation of the protected areas in Africa in general, which has to be related to sustainable development and international collaboration. \n The Committee emphasized the difficult situation in Zaire and requested the Chairperson to write a letter of condolence to the families of the rangers who were killed. \n The Committee decided to inscribe the Garamba National Park on the List of World Heritage in Danger, and urged the State Party to collaborate with WWF, IUCN, and the Centre to prepare a plan for corrective measures in conformity with the Operational Guidelines and encouraged international partners to collaborate to safeguard the northern white rhino and other wildlife populations in the Park. \n &nbsp;
