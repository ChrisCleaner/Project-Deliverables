The World Heritage Committee, \n 1. Having examined Documents WHC-08/32.COM/8B and WHC-08/32.COM/INF.8B1, \n 2. Refers the nomination of  S&atilde;o Francisco Square in S&atilde;o Crist&oacute;v&atilde;o ,  Brazil , back to the State Party in order to allow it: \n \n a) to reorient the comparative analysis in order to more convincingly demonstrate similarities and differences with other properties in Brazil and in the wider region; \n b) reconsider the proposed boundaries of the nominated property in order to include other sectors of the S&atilde;o Crist&oacute;v&atilde;o historic centre that might contribute to the potential Outstanding Universal Value of the property. In determining the boundaries of the nominated area and the buffer zone, it is recommended that the State Party take into account the geographical, historical, urban, architectural and cultural factors that have shaped the structure and the urban landscape of S&atilde;o Crist&oacute;v&atilde;o over the centuries. This could enable a more accurate identification of cultural values and define boundaries of areas that can clearly express them.  \n \n 3. Recommends, in order to enhance the conservation and management of the property, that: \n \n a) a complete statement in the Integrity and Authenticity should be drafted for this property, based on the values of the property and the various requirements set out in the  Operational Guidelines  and the Nara Document on Authenticity; \n b) more specific protection measures should be approved and implemented at the local level, including the approval of the Urban Planning Code; \n c) the State Party should continue to implement and improve conservation programmes to ensure the long term conservation of the property; \n d) the management structure and procedures should be improved by the development and implementation of a management plan for the nominated property; \n e) the management system of the property should be extended to include a better articulation between the different levels of government, greater participation of community associations and other stakeholders in the development and implementation of plans, visitor management, and the increase, diversification and improved skills of the staff involved in the management of the property; \n f) the State Party should define and implement a monitoring system for the long term state of conservation for the property, including key indicators and designation of a monitoring organization.
