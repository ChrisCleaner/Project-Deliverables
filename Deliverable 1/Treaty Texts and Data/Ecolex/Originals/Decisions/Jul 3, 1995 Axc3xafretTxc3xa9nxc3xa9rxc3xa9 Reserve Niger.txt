The Bureau recalled that the site was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1992 as it was affected by civil disturbances and its staff held hostage. The World Heritage Committee at its eighteenth session took note that a peace accord was signed on 9 October 1994 and encouraged the authorities to implement it and to undertake all efforts to safeguard the site. The Centre in cooperation with the authorities of Niger sent a mission to Niger to review the protected area system of Niger and to prepare a nomination of a natural site. As one of the outcomes of this mission, a preliminary report on A&iuml;r et T&amp;&amp;6 was prepared. It indicates that under the influence of a number ofdifferent factors, including, historical, socio-economic and political, an armed conflict developed during the last years(minority of Tuareg against the States). A major degradation of the site was noted including poaching. In 1995, however, a dialogue was established between the two parties, which makes the return to a normal situation possible and may allow evaluation of the state of conservation in detail and to elaborate how the World Heritage Fund could contribute to the action programme for the recovery of the site. \n The Representative of IUCN informed the Bureau that a 125,000 Swiss Franc project is under way with IUCN to assist in reestablishing the management regime. The Ambassador of Niger underlined that his Government is now taking every step to enhance the management of the site and wishes as soon as all conditions are met, that a mission should be sent to the site with the help of the World Heritage Centre. The Bureau recommended that the site be retained on the List of World Heritage in Danger, however, indicating on the basis of IUCN\'s report, that the site could be removed from the Danger List in due course.
