VIII/21:      To request the Secretariat to prepare a report which delineates all of the reporting mandates required by the Protocol and all of the reporting requests made in the decisions of the Parties. In preparing this report, the Secretariat should seek the views of Parties on which reporting provisions are essential for assessing compliance and which may no longer be necessary;   To request the Implementation Committee to review the report referred to above, consider which reporting provisions are essential for assessing compliance and which may no longer be necessary, and make recommendations to the Ninth Meeting of the Parties on potential ways to streamline the reporting requirements of the Montreal Protocol.
