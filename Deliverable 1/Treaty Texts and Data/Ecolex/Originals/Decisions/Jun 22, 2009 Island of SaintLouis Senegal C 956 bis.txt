The World Heritage Committee, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-09/33.COM/7B.Add, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  32 COM 7B.53 , adopted at its 32nd session (Quebec   City, 2008), \n 3.  Takes note  with appreciation of the actions taken by the State Party to improve the state of conservation of the property, including the establishment of a Safeguarding Committee for the property to bridge site management until full development of planned management mechanisms; \n 4.  Reiterates its request  to the State Party to: \n a) Implement the recently adopted Safeguarding and Enhancement Plan, \n b) Urgently appoint a site manager for the property, \n c) Launch preparation of the conservation and management plan first foreseen in the joint World Heritage Centre/ICCROM/ICOMOS reactive monitoring mission report of 2006; \n 5.  Encourages  the State Party to improve coordination of international co-operation partners while ensuring their contributions strengthen the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, and in collaboration with the World Heritage Centre to plan a future international donor\'s conference in 2010 or 2011; \n 6.  Considers  that the property continues to be threatened by the State Party\'s inability to implement the management initiatives requested by the World Heritage Committee, and by modern interventions which do not respect the Outstanding Universal Value of the World Heritage property; \n 7.  Requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre by  1 February 2010 , a report on the progress made to improve the property\'s state of conservation, and in responding to the World Heritage Committee\'s requests, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010 .
