The World Heritage Centre informed the Bureau that the damage caused by the invasion of this Sanctuary by militants from the Bodo tribe in Assam, India, was estimated to be about 50 million Indian rupees (about 1.6 million US dollars). Although considerable damage was done to the Park infrastructure, the habitat in the inaccessible parts of the Sanctuary still remained intact. The Bureau, while noting that the conditions for introducing normal management and administration regimes for the site may be improving, was nevertheless concerned that a full assessment of damage had not been made and that the Indian authorities have not yet provided a formal written report on the state of conservation of this Sanctuary, despite repeated, requests from the Committee since 1989. \n The Bureau reiterated that the World Heritage Centre contact the Indian authorities once again and request a written, up-to-date report on the state of conservation of the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary. The Bureau recommended that the Committee, at its next session, review the information provided by the Indian authorities in such a report and in consultation with IUCN and the World Heritage Centre, determine whether or not this site ought to be included in the List of World Heritage in Danger.
