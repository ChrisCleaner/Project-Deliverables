Recalling  that, pursuant to the objectives defined in decision I/6 of the Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, the Ozone Research Managers of the Parties to the Vienna Convention review ongoing national and international research and monitoring programmes with a view to ensuring the proper coordination of those programmes and identifying gaps that need to be addressed,    Recognizing  the need to improve the understanding and accuracy of future projections of global ozone amounts, including ozone layer recovery,    Recognizing also  the importance of continuing and enhancing existing observation capabilities for ozone layer and climate variables owing to the changing atmospheric composition and the strong coupling between the behaviour of the ozone layer and changes in climate,    Noting  the importance of capacity-building activities in developing countries and countries with economies in transition in order to expand their ability to participate in research and systematic observations relating to the ozone layer and the changing climate,   1. To take note with appreciation of the report of the tenth meeting of the Ozone Research Managers of the Parties to the Vienna Convention, published in 2017;[1]   2. To encourage parties to adopt and implement, as appropriate, the recommendations of the Ozone Research Managers under the topics of research, systematic observations, data archiving and stewardship and capacity\xe2\x80\x91building;   3. Also to encourage parties to accord priority to:   (a) Research and systematic observation activities on processes influencing the evolution of the ozone layer and its links to climate, including the prioritization of new measurement locations to optimize the co-location of ozone measurements with observations of other atmospheric species and parameters;   (b) Capacity-building activities in developing countries and countries with economies in transition, in particular through the continuation and expansion of regular calibration and intercomparison campaigns and through the provision of assistance to enable those parties to expand their scientific capacity and participate in ozone research activities, including assessment activities under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer;   4. To encourage the national ozone focal points to improve communication with the meteorological agencies and other relevant organizations in their countries on monitoring, research and scientific activities;      [1]  World Meteorological Organization Global Ozone Research and Monitoring Project Report No. 57.
