   (b) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cleaning, reworking, repair, or rebuilding of electronic components or assemblies;    (c) Preservation of publications and archives;    (d) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sterilization of materials in a laboratory;    (e) Testing of oil, grease and total petroleum hydrocarbons in water;    (f) Testing of tar in road-paving materials;     (g) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Forensic finger-printing;    (h) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All laboratory and analytical uses of methyl bromide except:      (i) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a reference or standard:      - To calibrate equipment which uses methyl bromide;    - To monitor methyl bromide emission levels;    - To determine methyl bromide residue levels in goods, plants and commodities;      (ii) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In laboratory toxicological studies;    (iii) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To compare the efficacy of methyl bromide and its alternatives inside a laboratory;    (iv) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a laboratory agent which is destroyed in a chemical reaction in the manner of feedstock;      (i) \xc2\xa0 Testing of organic matter in coal        Recalling  the conditions applied to the exemption for laboratory and analytical uses contained in Annex II of the report of the Sixth Meeting of the Parties .   1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 to extend the applicability of the global laboratory and analytical use exemption also to countries operating under Article 5(1) from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2010 for all ODS except those in Annex B Group III, Annex C Group I and Annex E.  2.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 to extend the global laboratory and analytical use exemption beyond 31 December 2010 until 31 December 2014:     (a) for Parties operating under Article 5(1) for all ODS except those in Annex B Group III, Annex C Group I and Annex E, and    (b) for Parties not operating under Article 5(1) for all ODS except those in Annex C Group I      3.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 to request all Parties to urge their national standards-setting organisations to identify and review those standards which mandate the use of ODS in laboratory and analytical procedures with a view to adopting, where possible, ODS-free laboratory and analytical products and processes;  4.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 to request the Ozone Secretariat to enter into discussion with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ASTM International (ASTM), the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) as well as with other relevant multinational standardisation organisations encouraging them to identify methods based on ODS and to expedite the inclusion of non-ODS alternative methods, techniques and substances in their standard methods;  5.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 to request the TEAP and its Chemicals Technical Options Committee to complete the report as requested under Decision XIX/18 and to provide for the 30th Open-ended Working Group meeting     (a) a list of laboratory and analytical uses of ODS, including those uses where no alternatives exist.    (b) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 to identify the international and national standards that require the use of ODS and to indicate the corresponding alternative standard methods not mandating the use of ODS.    (c)\xc2\xa0 to consider the technical and economical availability of those alternatives in Article-5 and non-Article-5 parties as well as to ensure that the alternative methods show similar or better statistical properties (for example accuracy or detection limits).      6.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 to request TEAP while continuing its work as described in paragraph 5, to evaluate the availability of alternatives for those uses already banned under the global exemption in Parties operating under Article 5(1), considering technical and economical aspects. By the 30th meeting of the Open-ended Working Group TEAP should present its findings and recommendations whether exemptions would be required for parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 for any of the uses already banned.  7.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 to allow Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 until 31 December 2010 to deviate from the existing laboratory and analytical use bans in individual cases, where a Party considers that this is justified, and to ask Parties to revisit this issue at the 22nd Meeting of the Parties.  8.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 to request the Ozone Secretariat to update the list of laboratory and analytical uses that the Parties have agreed should no longer be eligible under the global exemption, as required by Decision X/19 and to write to Parties reporting laboratory and analytical uses of ozone depleting substances encouraging them to transition to non-ozone depleting alternatives, where allowed by their national standards.  9.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 to request Parties to continue to investigate domestically the possibility of replacing ODS in those laboratory and analytical uses listed in the report by the TEAP and to make this information available to the Ozone Secretariat by 30 April 2010.  10.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To encourage UNEP to invite representatives of the Chemicals Technical Options Committee to regional network meetings to raise awareness of ODS alternatives for laboratory and analytical uses where problems have been specifically identified by members of that network. Where considered necessary other representatives from competent authorities of Parties could be invited to participate in the meeting.
