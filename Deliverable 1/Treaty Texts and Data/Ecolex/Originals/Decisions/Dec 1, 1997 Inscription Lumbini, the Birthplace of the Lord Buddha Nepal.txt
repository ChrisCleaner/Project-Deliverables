Lumbini, the Birthplace of the Lord Buddha   \n  666rev.   \n  Nepal    \n  C(iii)(vi)  \n The Committee decided to inscribe this site on the basis of criteria (iii) and (vi). As the birthplace of the Lord Buddha, the sacred area of Lumbini is one of the holiest places of one of the world\'s great religions, and its remains contain important evidence about the nature of Buddhist pilgrimage centres from a very early period. The Delegate of Thailand declared that apart from Lumbini, there are two other sites closely associated with Buddha which are in the process of preparation to be presented as serial nominations and that he hoped that the Committee would consider them in this context. \n &nbsp;
