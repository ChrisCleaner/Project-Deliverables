VIII.4  The Committee noted that the twenty-third extraordinary session of the Bureau had noted that the Government of Australia provided the Centre with complementary information concerning the mixed cultural and natural nomination of the  Greater Blue Mountains Area (Australia)  on 7 October 1999. The State Party has commenced preparation of additional detailed complementary material addressing issues raised by the Bureau at its twenty-third ordinary session in July 1999. The Bureau had recommended deferral for the natural part of the nomination and did not recommend inscription according to cultural values. The State Party has informed the Centre of its intention to submit new information by 30 January 2000 to enable the Bureau to fully consider the nomination at its twenty-fourth session in Paris in June/July 2000, and to prepare recommendations for the World Heritage Committee\'s twenty-fourth session in November 2000. Both ICOMOS and IUCN have agreed to this suggested timetable.
