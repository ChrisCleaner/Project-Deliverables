The Bureau took note of the information provided by the French authorities that agreement had been reached to establish a precisely defined protection zone around the Cathedral (Zone de protection du patrimoine architectural, urbain et paysager ZPPAUP), the exact limits of which remained to be defined, and that a project for the surroundings of the Cathedral (le Parvis) will be the subject of a competition. The ICOMOS-designated expert will be involved in this process. The Bureau requested the French authorities to keep the Committee informed on further developments regarding the protection and planning for the surroundings of the Cathedral.
