Taking note  of the report from the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and the Scientific Assessment Panel indicating the existence of a discrepancy between the emissions derived from reported production and consumption data from both parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and those not so operating and those inferred from atmospheric measurements,    Noting  that the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel is continuing its work and will provide information as called for in decision XXI/8 relating to carbon tetrachloride,    1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, in cooperation with the Scientific Assessment Panel, to continue to investigate the possible reasons for the identified discrepancy, considering in particular the extent to which the discrepancy could be due to:   (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Incomplete or inaccurate historical reporting of carbon tetrachloride produced;   (b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Uncertainties in the atmospheric lifetime of carbon tetrachloride;   (c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carbon tetrachloride from unreported or underestimated sources from both parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and those not so operating;   2.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to report on its work in response to paragraph 1 above to the Twenty-Fourth Meeting of the Parties;
