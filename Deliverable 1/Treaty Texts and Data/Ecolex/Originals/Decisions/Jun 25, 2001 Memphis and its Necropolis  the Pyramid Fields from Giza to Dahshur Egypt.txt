V.203&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Secretariat reported to the Bureau on information received, that certain local authorities were still considering having a new section of the Greater Cairo Ring Road built to cross the plateau of the Pyramids, despite the existence of a recently built by-pass linking the Ring Road to the road to Alexandria. The Bureau&rsquo;s attention was also drawn to the need to regulate the use of the area surrounding the pyramids, currently encroached by settlements and commercial activities. \n V.204&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Delegate of Thailand expressed his surprise at the news that, despite the Agreement reached between UNESCO and the Egyptian Government in 1998, the question was still a matter of discussion. \n V.205&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau, recalling the Agreement signed between UNESCO and the Egyptian Government in 1998, reaffirmed the importance of preventing any encroachment upon the site, such as highways, roads, water supply pipes and buildings within the World Heritage protected area. The Bureau invited the Egyptian authorities to develop and adopt, in consultation with the World Heritage Centre, a comprehensive Management Plan, with appropriate measures to protect the World Heritage site of Memphis Necropolis from unwanted urban developments and inappropriate uses.
