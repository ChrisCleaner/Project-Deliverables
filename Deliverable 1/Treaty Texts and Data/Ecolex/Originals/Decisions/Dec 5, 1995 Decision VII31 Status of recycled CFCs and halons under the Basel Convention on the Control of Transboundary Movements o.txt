The  Seventh Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. VII/31  that the international transfers of controlled substances of the Montreal Protocol which are recovered but not purified to usable purity specifications prescribed by appropriate international and/or national organizations, including International Standards Organization (ISO), should only occur if the recipient country has recycling facilities that can process the received controlled substances to these specifications or has destruction facilities incorporating technologies approved for that purpose.
