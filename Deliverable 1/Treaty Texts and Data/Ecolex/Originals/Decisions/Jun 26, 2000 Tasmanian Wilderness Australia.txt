The Bureau noted that as in the case of Shark Bay, ACIUCN has established a collaborative process to prepare a report on the state of conservation of this site. It noted the view expressed by IUCN that the process will be complete and a report submitted in 2001 subject to ACIUCN receiving adequate resources. The Bureau noted that the issues addressed will include the management of areas of the Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) which are outside of the World Heritage site but which have been previously identified as having World Heritage value, proposals to develop helicopter landing sites and impacts associated with bush walking. \n The Bureau was informed that the Australian Government was aware of the delays in the preparation of the report by ACIUCN due to resource and time constraints. The Delegate of Australia informed the Bureau that his Government is working with ACIUCN to develop a systematic approach to monitoring this site that could be also linked to periodic reporting of World Heritage sites in the Asia Pacific to be submitted to the World Heritage Committee in the year 2002. \n The Bureau, while recognising the resource and time constraints that ACIUCN is currently facing, requested ACIUCN to complete the process with the aim of submitting an up-to-date state of conservation report to the twenty-fifth ordinary session of the Bureau in 2001.
