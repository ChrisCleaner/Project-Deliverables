After having noted the report of the Secretariat on Petra and the report of the Director of the Department of Antiquities dated December 1996, the Bureau thanked the Jordanian authorities for their efforts to protect the site, but again insisted that preservation measures be urgently undertaken and that the coordination of on-site activities be reinforced with the support of UNESCO. Amongst these measures, it would be appropriate to provide the Petra Regional Council and the Coordination Group of the Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism with the means to function; to urgently regulate and limit the construction of hotels too near to the site, buildings and the extensions to houses in the vicinity of the site and on the Taybeh road; to closely study the negative impacts of measures encouraging uncontrolled influx of tourists, such as the widening of roads; and to preserve the natural environment through the conservation of all green and wooded areas (Hishe oak forest, the pine forest and agricultural terraces close to the entrance of the site). They also requested the authorities to refrain from undertaking restoration work within the site until the condition of the monuments has been carefully recorded.
