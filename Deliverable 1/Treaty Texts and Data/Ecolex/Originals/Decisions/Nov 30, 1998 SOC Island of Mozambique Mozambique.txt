VII.36 Island of Mozambique (Mozambique)  \n Thanks to a contribution from the World Heritage Fund, the World Heritage site Ilha de Mozambique, has been the object of the World Heritage Centre\'s "Programme for Sustainable Human Development and Integral Conservation". The programme, prepared in 1996, is funded by: UNDP - US$ 300,000 (over the period 1997-1999), UNESCO - US$ 100,000, European Union - US$ 100,000 and the Finnish Government, which is financing a post of an Associate Expert for the 2-year period (1997-1998). Currently, a number of micro-projects in such areas as: water and sanitation, tourism development and heritage restoration, are being developed. These projects will be presented to potential donors during the donor meeting scheduled for February 1999. \n In addition, works have already started on the restoration of the Casa da Cultura building to be used as the project office. The restoration is progressing relatively quickly and completion expected by January 1999. \n The Committee congratulated the Mozambique authorities for their efforts to preserve the Ilha de Mozambique by taking into account the social and economic aspects of the site and called upon the potential donors to support this endeavour. \n The Committee requested the authorities to report at its twentythird session on the results of the donor\'s meeting and on the progress made in the implementation of the "Programme for Sustainable Human Development and Integral Conservation". \n &nbsp;
