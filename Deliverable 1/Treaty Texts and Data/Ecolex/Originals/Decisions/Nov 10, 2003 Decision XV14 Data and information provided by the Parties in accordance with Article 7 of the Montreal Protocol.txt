The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/14:      To note that the implementation of the Protocol by those Parties that have reported data is satisfactory;   To note with appreciation that 160 Parties out of the 183 that should have reported data for 2002 have now done so, but that 23 have still not reported to date;   To note also that lack of timely data reporting by Parties impedes effective monitoring and assessment of Parties\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with their obligations under the Montreal Protocol;   To urge Parties strongly to report consumption and production data as soon as the figures are available, rather than waiting until the final deadline of 30 September every year.
