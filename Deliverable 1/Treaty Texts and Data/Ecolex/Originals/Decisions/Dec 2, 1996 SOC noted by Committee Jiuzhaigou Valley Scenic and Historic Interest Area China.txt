VII.38 Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic and Historic Interest Area   (China)  \n The Bureau at its twentieth extraordinary session took note of a progress report which was prepared by IUCN\'s Commission on National Parks during a visit to the site in August 1996. The Bureau recalled that the Committee in 1992 had made recommendations on human impacts at the site and its possible extension. It noted substantial progress in dealing with the growing human impact in the area, and the possibility of twinning the site with another World Heritage site in Europe. On the other hand, the Committee I s recommendation concerning an extension of the site to make it contiguous with Huanglong Scenic and Historic Interest Area had not been acted upon. \n The Bureau welcomed the prospects of twinning and commended the Chinese authorities for addressing some of the human impact issues. The Bureau however, reiterated the Committee\'s previous recommendation encouraging the possibility of extending the site. \n &nbsp;
