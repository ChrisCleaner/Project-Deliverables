The Bureau noted that it had not received the State Party&rsquo;s report that was requested by the Bureau at its twenty-third extraordinary session. The Observer of Germany expressed his regret for the delay. The Bureau reiterated the request for a report on the integration of the Roman water pipes and town ramparts in the plan for the buildings close to the Roman Amphitheatre. It requested the German authorities to submit this plan by 15 September 2000 for examination by ICOMOS and by the Bureau at its twenty-fourth extraordinary session.&nbsp;
