The Bureau recalled that an environmental impact study had found that the construction of a road through this National Park was preferable to the alternative of routing the road along the periphery of the Park because the route inside the Park could be better patrolled by Park staff. The Bureau noted that although the construction of the road had begun, work on the road has been temporarily suspended due to the beginning of the rainy season. The Delegate of Senegal informed the Bureau that the National Park Service had established several points, including one at Niokolo-Koba, to monitor traffic currently using the cotton route outside of the northern periphery of the Park, and that the Government of Senegal has prepared a plan to mitigate the impacts of the road construction project and draw up eco-management regimes for areas outside the periphery of the Park. The Bureau wished that a summary of the Plan be translated into English and presented to the members of the Committee during its sixteenth session scheduled to be held in December 1992.
