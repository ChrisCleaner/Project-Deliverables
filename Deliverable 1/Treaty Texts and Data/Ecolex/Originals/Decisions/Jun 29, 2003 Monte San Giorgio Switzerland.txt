The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Inscribes \xc2\xa0  Monte San Giorgio ,  Switzerland , on the World Heritage List on the basis of natural\xc2\xa0 criterion (i):   Criterion (i):  Monte San Giorgio is the single best known record of marine life in the Triassic period, and records important remains of life on land as well. The property has produced diverse and numerous fossils, many of which show exceptional completeness and detailed preservation. The long history of study of the property and the disciplined management of the resource have created a well documented and catalogued body of specimens of exceptional quality, and are the basis for a rich associated geological literature. As a result, Monte San Giorgio provides the principal point of reference, relevant to future discoveries of marine Triassic remains throughout the world.   2.  Requests  that the State Party ensure that the boundaries of the property are marked clearly on the ground;  3.  Encourages  the State Party to develop on-site interpretation, so that visitors to the property can readily appreciate its significance, linking this interpretation to the development of the Meride Mmuseum;  4.  Further encourages  the authorities of Switzerland and Italy to collaborate in a proposal for a transboundary extension of the property into Italian territory, once satisfactory levels of political commitment have been attained and it is clear that the conditions of integrity can be met.
