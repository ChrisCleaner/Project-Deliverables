(The Parties may themselves request the implementing agencies to provide their comments so that they can be submitted along with their requests to the Implementation Committee);   Following review of an initial request submission, if the Implementation Committee requires further information from a Party, the Party will be invited to take advantage of clause 7 (e) of the non-compliance procedure to invite an Implementation Committee representative, or other authorized representative, to their country to identify and/or review the outstanding information.
