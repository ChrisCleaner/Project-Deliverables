The World Heritage Committee,   1.  Inscribes   Val d\'Orcia, Italy,  on the World Heritage List as a cultural landscape on the basis of cultural criteria (iv) and (vi):    Criterion (iv):  The Val d\xe2\x80\x99Orcia is an exceptional reflection of the way the landscape was re-written in Renaissance times to reflect the ideals of good governance and to create an aesthetically pleasing picture.    Criterion (vi):  The landscape of the Val d\xe2\x80\x99Orcia was celebrated by painters from the Siennese School, which flourished during the Renaissance. Images of the Val d\xe2\x80\x99Orcia, and particularly depictions of landscapes where people are depicted as living in harmony with nature, have come to be seen as icons of the Renaissance and have profoundly influenced the development of landscape thinking.   2.  Requests  the State Party to undertake as soon as possible a landscape survey identifying qualities and features of the planned \xe2\x80\x98colonial\xe2\x80\x99 landscape and their association with traditional practices;   3.  Further requests  the State Party to undertake as soon as possible a survey of vernacular buildings;   4.  Encourages  the State Party to compile an accessible history of the colonisation process drawing on contemporary documentation to explain the political, social, economic and visionary thinking behind the project, the involvement of artists and architects, and the way the area was subsequently managed, in order that the full significances of the area can be understood and sustained;   5.  Further encourages  the State Party to put in place an assessment of the condition of natural elements that affect the landscape of the park, such as soil, vegetation and water management, in order to inform sustainable management practices.
