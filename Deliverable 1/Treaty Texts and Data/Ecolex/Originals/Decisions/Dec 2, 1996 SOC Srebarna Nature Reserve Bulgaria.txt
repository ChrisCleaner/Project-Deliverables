VII.14 Srebarna Nature Reserve (Bulgaria)  \n The Committee recalled that at its nineteenth session it examined a monitoring report prepared by the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention. This report indicated that the new water control structure allowed for an inflow of water on a small scale and that a colony of the Dalmatian Pelican had been re-established. The report concluded, however, that the integrity of the site had not yet been adequately restored. \n As a result, the Committee decided at its nineteenth session to retain the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger and requested the Bulgarian authorities to prepare a status report on their efforts to restore the site, to be presented in three years\' time. \n The Committee decided to retain this property on the List of World Heritage in Danger pending the threat mitigation status report which the Committee requested the Bulgarian authorities to submit in 1998. \n &nbsp;
