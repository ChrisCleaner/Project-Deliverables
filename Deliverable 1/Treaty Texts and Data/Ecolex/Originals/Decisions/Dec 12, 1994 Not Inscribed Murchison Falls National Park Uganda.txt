Murchison Falls National Park  \n  683  \n  Uganda    \n The Committee recognized Murchison Falls as an important natural phenomena and as a habitat of elephants, giraffes and Nile crocodile, though populations of these species have been seriously reduced due to civil disturbances of the past decade. However, the Committee decided not to inscribe this site on the List because it considered its international significance to be secondary in comparison to similar sites in the region. The Committee, nevertheless, commended and encouraged the Government of Uganda and the GTZ for their efforts to restore the site and suggested that the Ugandan Government may consider recognition of this site as a core of a biosphere reserve. \n &nbsp;
