Serra da Capivara National Park (Brazil)  \n The Bureau considered a request for technical assistance for the amount of US$ 53,000 for the site of Serra da Capivara in Brazil which consisted of two components: \n &nbsp; \n 1. Assistance for taking measures in three of the most visited sites in the Park (Toea do Baixao do Perna I, Toea do Baixao da Vaca and Sitio do Meio) with the double objective of protecting the paintings and at the same time better controlling and facilitating visits to the sites: \n The Bureau  considered  it necessary that preparatory assistance be provided to study in detail and in cooperation with international experts, which measures would be the most appropriate. The Bureau  recommends  the Committee, therefore, not to approve this request, but to allocate instead an amount of  US$ 15,000  under&nbsp; preparatory assistance in order to study the protection of the rock paintings. \n &nbsp; \n 2. Assistance for the purchase of equipment for the&nbsp;inventory and documentation of the rock paintings:&nbsp; \n The Bureau  recommends  the Committee to approve the amount of  US$ 28,000  for the purchase of equipment that is necessary for the documentation and inventory of the rock paintings in this site. \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp;
