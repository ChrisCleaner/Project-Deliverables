The Committee noted that several areas nominated which meet the criteria may be marginal because of the inability of States, for various reasons to apply the rigid management criteria which they believe is necessary. The Committee was concerned that this could lead to further deterioration of these sites if corrective measures were not implemented. The Committee therefore decided to amend the "Operational Guidelines" by adding a sub-paragraph (vi) to paragraph 11 as follows: \n "Where the intrinsic qualities of a World Heritage site are threatened by action or works of man and yet meet the criteria set out in paragraph 10, an action plan outlining the corrective measures required shall be submitted with the nomination form. Should the corrective measures submitted by the nominating State not be taken within the time proposed by that State, the site will be considered by the Committee for delisting in accordance with the procedure adopted by the Committee."
