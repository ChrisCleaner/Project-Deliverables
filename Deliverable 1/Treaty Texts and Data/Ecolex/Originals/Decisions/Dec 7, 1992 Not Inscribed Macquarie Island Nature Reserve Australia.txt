Macquarie   Island&nbsp;Nature Reserve  \n  629  \n  Australia   \n The Committee noted that this natural site had interesting geological value but was of the view that its characteristics were not of universal significance. However, the Committee endorsed the recommendation of IUCN that the Australian authorities consider Macquarie in the wider sense of an oceanic island ecosystem representative of the subantarctic biogeographic realm. The Committee noted that Macquarie\'s values might be enhanced if it was assessed in combination with some of New Zealand\'s neighbouring island groups and in the long-term could be a part of an international nomination. \n &nbsp;
