The World Heritage Committee:  1.  Notes  that there has been significant progress on invasive-species and marine conservation, quarantine and institutional strengthening actions, notably through the implementation of the UNESCO/United Nations Foundation (UNF)/Charles Darwin Foundation, Global Environment Facility (GEF)/United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) projects. There have been clear signs of Government commitment to conservation, most notably the successful nomination of the Galapagos Marine Reserve for World Heritage status and the mobilization of resources to support reserve management.\xc2\xa0 However, these positive steps are increasingly undermined by the failure to complete and promulgate the Special Regulations, without which the Special Law for Galapagos - and particularly the environmental components thereof - cannot be properly implemented; 2.  Urges  the State Party to adopt as soon as possible the Regulations deriving from the Special Law for Galapagos, as recommended by the 25th session of the Committee in 2001 at the time of inscription of the Galapagos Marine Reserve on the World Heritage List.
