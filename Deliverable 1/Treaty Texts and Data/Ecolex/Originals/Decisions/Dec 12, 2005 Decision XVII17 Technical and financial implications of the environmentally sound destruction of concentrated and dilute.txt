The  Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVII/17:     Recognizing  that, in the preamble to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties affirmed that, for the protection of the ozone layer, precautionary measures should be taken to control equitably total global emissions of substances that deplete it, with the ultimate objective of their elimination on the basis of developments in scientific knowledge,    Bearing in mind  that, for most Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5, chlorofluorocarbons which remain to be phased out are concentrated in the refrigeration servicing sector and that, as a result, their final elimination will only be achieved when all existing installed equipment has been replaced,    Considering  that the replacement of such equipment necessitates a range of complex activities, including, among other things, economic incentives for end-users and the development of recovery, transport and environmentally sound destruction processes for obsolete equipment, with particular attention paid to training for this purpose and to the destruction of the chlorofluorocarbons released by such processes,    Noting  the outcomes of the expert meeting on destruction of ozone depleting substances that will be held in Montreal from 22 to 24 February 2006,     To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to prepare terms of reference for the conduct of case-studies in Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol, with regional representation, on the technology and costs associated with a process for the replacement of chlorofluorocarbon-containing refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment, including the environmentally sound recovery, transport and final disposal of such equipment and of the associated chlorofluorocarbons;   That these studies should explore economic and other incentives which will encourage users to phase out equipment and ozone-depleting substances and to reduce emissions, as well as the viability and costs of setting up destruction facilities in countries operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol, and that the said studies should include a regional analysis relating to the management, transport and destruction of chlorofluorocarbons;   Also to request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to review possible synergies with other conventions such as the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to adopt the recovery and destruction efficiency parameter proposed in the Panel\xe2\x80\x99s report to the Open-ended Working Group at its twenty-fifth meeting as the parameter to be applied in developing the proposed study referred to above;   That said terms of reference shall be submitted to the Parties at the twenty-sixth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group, and that provision will be made for resources for this purpose in the 2006-2008 replenishment of the Multilateral Fund.
