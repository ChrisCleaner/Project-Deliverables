VII.20 Wieliczka Salt Mines (Poland)  \n The Secretariat informed the Committee that it had received from the Polish authorities a technical report assessing the effectiveness of the dehumidifying system at the mines. The report stated that the system had contributed to the elimination of one of the major preservation hazards to historic sculptures, chambers and passages in the salt mine. \n ICOMOS advised that the report was credible and that it fully supported the deletion of the Salt Mines from the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n The Committee noted with satisfaction that the dehumidifying system, installed with the support of the World Heritage Fund, the Polish-American Fund of Maria Sklodowska-Curie and the Polish Government, had proven to be effective and made it possible to eliminate one of the major threats to the site. \n It decided, therefore, to delete the Wieliczka Salt Mines from the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
