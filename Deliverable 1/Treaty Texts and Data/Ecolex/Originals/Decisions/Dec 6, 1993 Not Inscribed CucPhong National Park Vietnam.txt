Cuc-Phong National Park  \n  673  \n  Vietnam  \n The Committee recognized the importance of the site as the first National Park in Vietnam. The site, however, does not meet the criteria of outstanding universal value under either natural or cultural criteria, and therefore was not recommended for inscription on the World Heritage List. During IUCN\'s field review of this site it was noted that other forest sites may fulfil the criteria and should be reviewed. \n &nbsp;
