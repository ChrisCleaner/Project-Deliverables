The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-10/34.COM/7B.Add, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  33 COM 7B.42 , adopted at its 33rd session (Seville, 2009), \n 3.  Expresses great concern  at the considerable damage caused to the property by the recent floods and landslides affecting both, the fabric of the property and access to it, and considers that the lack of adequate regulatory measures and disaster response plans appears to have exacerbated their impact; \n 4.  Urges  the State Party to improve the implementation of the actions requested at its 33rd session (Seville, 2009), and recommended by the reinforced monitoring mission, in particular: \n a) Definition and implementation of provisions to be included in a revised management plan, derived from participatory processes, to address threats derived from unregulated access to the site, absence of a public use plan and inadequate urban planning, \n b) Further development of the submitted risk reduction and disaster recovery plan to include clear and precise course of action to inform visitors and residents of the actual and potential risks and to provide mitigation strategies as a matter of urgency, \n c) Undertake a management effectiveness assessment and integration of the results into a revision of the management plan and related capacity building programmes, \n d) Establishment and implementation of regulatory measures for the western access to the sanctuary and finalize the commissioned public use plan, \n e) Implementation of strategies to strengthen decision-making processes and governance at the property; \n 5.  Notes  that unresolved issues as well as the new natural risk conditions constitute a danger to the attributes that sustain the Outstanding Universal Value and integrity of the property, and  also notes  that the State Party requests the application of the Reinforced Monitoring Mechanism; \n 6.  Recommends  that, given the major natural and structural threats facing the property, the State Party establish an international support panel to provide technical advice and support to the State Party, in order to advocate for the political will and resources needed to address governance and sustainable finance issues, to guide effective stakeholder involvement, to seek support for the implementation of the 2009 Action Plan, and to address the backlog of unaddressed management issues; \n 7.  R  equests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2011 , a report on the state of conservation of the property and on the steps taken to implement the above mentioned recommendations, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 35th session in 2011 , with a view to considering, in the absence of substantial progress, the possible inscription of the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
