The Bureau was informed that the UNESCO Equipment Division, in cooperation with the Centre, sent a mission to this World Heritage site in April 1995 to review the current international assistance projects at the site and to carry out an evaluation and assessment of future needs. The mission carried out a detailed review of technical assistance projects under the World Heritage Fund (including the purchase of boats) and helped in designing appropriate projects. This includes a project for an ecological inventory of the coastal regions of the islands in Lake Malawi National Park, which would allow authorities to better monitor changes of the state of conservation of the site. During the mission an environmental education project was discussed at the site which would involve the local villages within the World Heritage area. Such a programme would be crucial, as the population within the Park is growing and is heavily dependent on fish and wood as principal resources. The Bureau took note of this report.
