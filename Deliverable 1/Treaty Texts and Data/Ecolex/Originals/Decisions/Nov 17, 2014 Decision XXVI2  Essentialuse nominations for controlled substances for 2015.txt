Noting with appreciation  the work done by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Medical Technical Options Committee,    Mindful  that, according to decision IV/25, the use of chlorofluorocarbons for metered\xe2\x80\x91dose inhalers does not qualify as an essential use if technically and economically feasible alternatives or substitutes are available that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health,    Noting  the Panel\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that technically satisfactory alternatives to chlorofluorocarbon\xe2\x80\x91based metered\xe2\x80\x91dose inhalers are available for some therapeutic formulations for treating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,    Taking into account  the Panel\xe2\x80\x99s analysis and recommendations for essential-use exemptions for controlled substances for the manufacture of metered-dose inhalers used for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,    Welcoming  the continued progress of several parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 in reducing their reliance on chlorofluorocarbon-based metered-dose inhalers as alternatives are developed, receive regulatory approval and are marketed for sale,   1. To authorize the levels of production and consumption for 2015 necessary to satisfy essential uses of chlorofluorocarbons for metered-dose inhalers for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as specified in the annex to the present decision;   2. To request nominating parties to provide the Medical Technical Options Committee with information to enable the assessment of essential-use nominations, in accordance with the criteria contained in decision IV/25 and subsequent relevant decisions, as set out in the handbook on essential\xe2\x80\x91use nominations;   3. To encourage parties with essential-use exemptions in 2015 to consider initially sourcing required pharmaceutical-grade chlorofluorocarbons from stockpiles where they are available and accessible, provided that such stockpiles are used subject to the conditions established by the Meeting of the Parties in paragraph 2 of its decision VII/28;   4. To encourage parties with stockpiles of pharmaceutical-grade chlorofluorocarbons potentially available for export to parties with essential-use exemptions in 2015 to notify the Ozone Secretariat of those quantities and to provide it with the details of a contact point by 31 December 2014;   5. To request the Secretariat to post on its website details of the potentially available stocks referred to in paragraph 4 of the present decision;   6. That the party listed in the annex to the present decision shall have full flexibility in sourcing the quantity of pharmaceutical-grade chlorofluorocarbons to the extent required for manufacturing metered\xe2\x80\x91dose inhalers, as authorized in paragraph 1 of the present decision, from imports, from domestic producers or from existing stockpiles;   7. To request that parties consider domestic regulations to ban the launch or sale of new chlorofluorocarbon-based metered-dose inhaler products, even if such products have been approved;   8. To encourage parties to fast-track their administrative processes for the registration of metered-dose inhaler products in order to speed up the transition to chlorofluorocarbon-free alternatives;   Annex   Essential-use authorizations for 2015 of chlorofluorocarbons for metered\xe2\x80\x91dose inhalers   (Metric tonnes)        Party     2015        China   182.61
