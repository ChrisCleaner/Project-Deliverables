Recognizing that the best available scientific information indicates that action to help migratory species adapt to climate change is urgently required in order to meet the objectives of the Convention; to give proper effect to Articles II and III, and to the instruments adopted under Article IV, whereas at the same time there is a need to expand and refine knowledge concerning the impacts of climate change on migratory species;   Emphasizing  the need to coordinate action to help migratory species adapt to climate change within the framework of the CMS instruments   Acknowledging  that recent scientific evidence indicates that the importance of current protected areas and protected area networks for migratory species conservation is not expected to diminish on account of climate change and in many instances may increase;   Recognizing  that it will often be necessary to enhance protected areas and networks in order to maximize representativeness and thereby increasing their contribution to migratory species conservation in light of climate change, and to better integrate these into wider landscapes and seascapes;   Mindful  of the call on Parties and Signatories to CMS instruments in Resolution 10.19 to enable the full participation in CMS and CMS instruments of States that are not currently within the range of the species involved, but are expected to become Range States in the future due to climate change;   Further recognizing  that the understanding of certain terms in the Convention, in particular the term \xe2\x80\x9chistoric coverage\xe2\x80\x9d in Article I(1)(4)(c), should be re-examined in the current era of climate change, bearing in mind that the Convention was concluded before the implications of climate change for migratory species conservation became apparent;   Recalling  that Resolution 10.19 of the Tenth Conference of the Parties (COP10) established the position of a COP-Appointed Councillor for Climate Change and requested the preparation of a Programme of Work and the convening of an intersessional Working Group;   Taking note  of the report of the Workshop that took place in Gu\xc3\xa1cimo (Province of Lim\xc3\xb3n, Costa Rica) from 9-11 April 2014, and  thanking  the Government of Costa Rica and its agency for protected areas, SINAC (National System for Conservation Areas), for very effectively hosting this workshop;   Further noting  the report of the ACCOBAMS Expert Workshop on the impact of climate change on cetaceans of the Mediterranean and Black Seas that took place in Monaco on 11 June 2014, and its recommendations, including Key Messages to Governments and Others;   Acknowledging  with thanks the contributions of the members of the Climate Change Working Group established under the Scientific Council; and   Further acknowledging  the key role of the financial donors of this project which made it possible to develop the Programme of Work, in particular the Governments of Germany and Monaco for their voluntary contributions, and SINAC and UNDP for their in-kind contributions;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;The Conference of the Parties to the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals    1.Adopts  the \xe2\x80\x9cProgramme of Work on Climate Change and Migratory Species\xe2\x80\x9d (the POW) annexed to this resolution and  urges  Parties and Signatories to the CMS instruments and  encourages  non-Parties to implement the POW as a matter of priority, if applicable and to the extent possible given the particular circumstances of each Party;  2.  Requests  Parties and Signatories to the CMS instruments to assess what steps are necessary to help migratory species cope with climate change and take action to give effect to the POW on Climate Change;  3.  Requests  the Scientific Council and the Working Group on Climate Change to promote work to address key gaps in knowledge and future research directions, in particular through the analysis of existing long-term and large-scale datasets;  4.  Requests  the Secretariat to ensure the integration of elements of this POW into the Companion Volume of the Strategic Plan for migratory species to ensure mainstreaming of climate change, avoiding duplication, enhancing synergies and cooperation;  5.  Instructs  the Secretariat, in collaboration with Parties and relevant international organizations, subject to the availability of funds, to address specific issues and promote the implementation of the POW and share best practice and lessons learnt in the effective mitigation of climate change impacts, including through the organization of regional workshops;&nbsp;  6.  Calls on  Parties and non-Parties and stakeholders, with the support of the Secretariat, to strengthen national and local capacity for the implementation of the POW and the protection of species impacted by climate change, including,  inter alia , by developing partnerships with key stakeholders and organizing training courses, translating and disseminating examples of best practice, sharing and implementing protocols and regulations, transferring technology, and promoting the use of online and other tool to address specific issues contained in the POW;  7. Agrees that Article I (1) (c) (4) of the Convention, on the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfavourable conservation status\xe2\x80\x9d could be interpreted as follows in light of climate change:   According to Article I (1) (c) (4) of the Convention, one of the conditions to be met for the conservation status of a species to be taken as \xe2\x80\x9cfavourable\xe2\x80\x9d is that: \xe2\x80\x9cthe distribution and abundance of the migratory species approach historic coverage and levels to the extent that potentially suitable ecosystems exist and to the extent consistent with wise wildlife management\xe2\x80\x9d. Whereas there is a continued need to undertake conservation action within the historic range of migratory species, such action will increasingly also need to be taken beyond the historic range of species in order to ensure a favourable conservation status, particularly with a view to climate-induced range shifts. Such action beyond the historic range of species is compatible with, and may be required in order to meet the objectives and the obligations of Parties under the Convention ;  8.  Urges  Parties and  invites  relevant international organizations, bilateral and multilateral donors to support financially the implementation of the POW including through the provision of financial and other assistance to developing countries for relevant capacity building;  9.  Proposes  the continuation of the Climate Change Working Group until COP12, extending its membership to incorporate expertise from geographical regions currently absent, and to prioritize, facilitate and monitor the implementation of the POW;  10.  Requests  the Secretariat to liaise with the secretariats of relevant MEAs, including in particular the secretariats of the CBD, UNFCCC, UNCCD, Ramsar Convention and World Heritage Convention, in collaboration with/through the Biodiversity Liaison Group, to promote synergies and coordinate activities related to climate change adaptation including, where appropriate, the organization of back-to-back meetings and joint activities; and  11.  Calls on  Parties and the Scientific Council to report progress in implementing the POW, including monitoring and the efficacy of measures taken, to COP12 in 2017, ensuring as far as possible integration into the national reports for CMS.
