The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-06/30.COM/7B ,  2.  Recalling  Decision  28 COM 14B.49 , adopted at its 28th session (Suzhou, 2004),   3.  Commends  the City Council on securing investment to construct a new Museum building;  4.  Notes with great concern  that the new Museum building next to the Three Graces does not comply with the recommendation of the 28th session as it is designed to be dominant rather than recessive; and  also notes  that three additional new buildings are being planned on the waterfront, one of which could also be intrusive in architectural terms;   5.  Requests  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre/ICOMOS monitoring mission to consider the impact of these proposals on the World Heritage property;   6.  Urges  the State Party to put in place strategic plans for future development that set out clear strategies for the overall townscape and for the skyline and river front;  7.  Further requests  the State Party to provide the World Heritage Centre with an updated report by  1 February 2007  on the progress of strategic plans for future development and on the state of conservation of the property, for examination by the Committee at its 31st session in 2007.
