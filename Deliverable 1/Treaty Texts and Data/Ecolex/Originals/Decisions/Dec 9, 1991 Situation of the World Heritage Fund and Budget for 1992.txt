54. The Committee examined document SC-91/CONF.002/9 presenting the status of contributions to the World Heritage Fund for the years 1981-85, 1986-87, 1988-89 and 1990-1991. The Committee was pleased to note that several States Parties such as Brazil, Bulgaria, France, Germany and the United States of America had paid their contribution up to 1990-91 and welcomed the offer of the United States of America to provide an additional US$ 100,000 as a voluntary contribution for the same biennium. The Committee noted with concern that several States Parties have not paid their mandatory contributions to the Fund and urged them to do so as soon as possible in order to minimize the financial constraints to the implementation of the Convention. \n 55.
