The Bureau recalled that the site was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1988 and was the subject of a monitoring report at the sixteenth session of the Committee held in Santa Fe. At that time the management regime had collapsed and the site was under numerous threats. It was recommended that the World Heritage Centre should carry out a mission to the site. Unstable conditions continued to prevail throughout 1993 and into 1994. \n In 1994 a new government took office and the French company, "Compagnie Generale d\'A&eacute;ronautique-CGA&rdquo; decided to move forward with a significant tourism venture for which they had obtained a 20-year concession in 1985. The &lsquo;Company La Gounda-Manova S.A." has been working with the new government negotiating funding,staffing and management direction for the site. From the 9 to 14 of May 1995 a monitoring mission was carried out on behalf of the World Heritage Centre by staff member of the Division of Ecological Sciences of UNESCO. This mission produced a positive report on the current situation in the Park. The Bureau took note of the report, acknowledged that finally a report was made on this World Heritage site and asked the Centre and IUCN to jointly follow-up the project.
