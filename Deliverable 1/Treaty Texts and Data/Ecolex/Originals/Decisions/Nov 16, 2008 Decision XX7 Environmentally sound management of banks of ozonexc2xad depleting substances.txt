1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To invite Parties, international funding agencies, including the Multilateral Fund and the Global Environment Facility, and other interested agents to enable practical solutions for the purpose of gaining better knowledge on mitigating ozone-depleting substance emissions and destroying ozone-depleting substance banks, and on costs related to the collection, transportation, storage and destruction of ozone depleting substances, notably in Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article\xc2\xa05 of the Montreal Protocol;  2.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund to consider as a matter of urgency commencing pilot projects that may cover the collection, transport, storage and destruction of ozone-depleting substances.\xc2\xa0 As an initial priority, the Executive Committee might consider projects with a focus on assembled stocks of ozone-depleting substances with high net global warming potential, in a representative sample of regionally diverse Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5. It is understood that this initial priority would not preclude the initiation of other types of pilot projects, including on halons and carbon tetrachloride, should these have an important demonstration value. In addition to protecting the ozone layer, these projects will seek to generate practical data and experience on management and financing modalities, achieve climate benefits, and would explore opportunities to leverage co-financing;  3.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To encourage Parties to develop or consider further improvements in the implementation of national and/or regional legislative strategies and other measures that prevent the venting, leakage or emission of ozone-depleting substances by ensuring:  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Proper recovery of ozone-depleting substances from equipment containing ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances, during servicing, use and at end of life, where possible in applications such as refrigeration, air conditioning, heat pumps, fire protection, solvents and process agents;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The use of best practices and performance standards to prevent ozone-depleting substance emissions at the end of the product life cycle, whether by recovery, recycling, reclamation, reuse as feedstock or destruction;  4.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To encourage all Parties to develop or consider improvements in national or regional strategies for the management of banks, including provisions to combat illegal trade   by applying measures listed in decision XIX/12;  5.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To invite Parties to submit their strategies and subsequent updates to the Ozone Secretariat as soon as possible for the purpose of sharing information and experiences, including with interested stakeholders of other multilateral environmental agreements, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol and the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. The strategies will be placed on the Ozone Secretariat website, which will be updated regularly;  6.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To note that any project implemented pursuant to the present decision when applicable should be done in conformity with national, regional, and/or international requirements, such as those mandated by the Basel Convention and Rotterdam Convention;  7. \xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of destroying banks of ozone-depleting substances taking into consideration the relative economic costs and environmental benefits, to the ozone layer and the climate, of destruction versus recycling, reclaiming and reusing such substances. In particular, the report should cover the following elements:  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Consolidation of all available data on ozone-depleting substance banks and summary of this information identifying the sectors where recovery of ozone-depleting substances is technically and economically feasible;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Respective levels of likely mitigation amounts, based on the categorization of reachable banks at low, medium, and high effort according to substances, sectors, regions, and where possible, subregions;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (c) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Assessment of associated benefits and costs of respective classes of banks in terms of ozone depleting potential and global warming potential;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (d)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exploration of the potential \xe2\x80\x9cperverse incentives\xe2\x80\x9d or other adverse environmental effects that may be associated with certain mitigation strategies, in particular related to recovery and recycling for reuse;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (e)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Consideration of the positive and negative impacts of recovery and destruction of ozone-depleting substances, including direct and indirect climate effects;  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (f)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Consideration of the technical, economic and environmental implications of incentive mechanisms to promote the destruction of surplus ozone-depleting substances;  8. \xc2\xa0 To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to provide an interim report in time for dissemination one month before the twenty-ninth meeting of the Open\xe2\x80\x91ended Working Group and to provide the final report one month before the Twenty First Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol;  9.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Ozone Secretariat, with the assistance of the Multilateral Fund Secretariat, to consult with experts from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Global Environment Facility, the Executive Board of the Clean Development Mechanism, the World Bank and other relevant funding experts to develop a report on possible funding opportunities for the management and destruction of ozone-depleting substance banks, to present the report to the Parties for review and comments one month prior to the twenty\xe2\x80\x91ninth meeting of the Open-Ended Working Group and, if possible, to convene a single meeting among experts from the funding institutions;  10.
