Property:  Mount   Wuyi    \n Id. N\xc2\xb0:  911  \n State Party:  China    \n Criteria:  N (iii) (iv) / C(iii) (vi)  \n The Committee decided to inscribe the site on the World Heritage List under  natural criteria (iii) and (iv)  and  cultural criteria (iii) and (vi).  \n  Natural criteria (iii) and (iv)  : Mount Wuyi is one of the most outstanding subtropical forests in the world. It is the largest, most representative example of a largely intact forest encompassing the diversity of the Chinese Subtropical Forest and the South Chinese Rainforest. It acts as a refuge for a large number of ancient, relict plant species, many of them endemic to China and contains large numbers of reptile, amphibian and insect species. The riverine landscape of Nine-Bend Stream (lower gorge) is also of exceptional scenic quality in its juxtaposition of smooth rock cliffs with clear, deep water. \n  Cultural criteria (iii)  and  (vi) :   \n   Criterion (iii)  : Mount Wuyi is a landscape of great beauty that has been protected for more than twelve centuries. It contains a series of exceptional archaeological sites, including the Han City established in the 1st century BC and a number of temples and study centres associated with the birth of Neo-Confucianism in the 11th century AD. \n   Criterion (vi)  : Mount Wuyi was the cradle of Neo- Confucianism, a doctrine that played a dominant role in the countries of Eastern and South-Eastern Asia for many centuries and influenced philosophy and government over much of the world.
