Talamanca-La Amistad National Park (Costa Rica-Panama)  \n The Committee commended the Panamanian authorities for preventing 59,000 hectares of La Amistad National Park being released for oil exploration. \n The Committee noted that the Costa Rican authorities have not yet informed the Centre of their views on its recommendation, made at its last session, to consider revising the boundaries of the Talamanca-La Amistad Reserves by deleting four Indian Reserves in the north-eastern Atlantic sector and submit a map showing the new boundaries of the site. The Committee was also informed of a proposal to construct a road through the Talamanca-La Amistad Reserves and that the Costa Rican authorities have not yet responded to the Centre\'s request for information on the proposal and its potential impact on the state of conservation of the site. \n The Committee instructed the Centre to contact the Costa Rican authorities to request, once again, (a) that they consider revising the boundaries of the Reserves and provide a map showing the new boundaries and (b) to obtain detailed information regarding the proposal for constructing a road through the middle of the Talamanca-La Amistad Reserves, including an assessment of the potential impact of this project on the state of conservation of the site. \n The Committee instructed the Centre to contact the Costa Rican authorities to request, once again, (a) that they consider revising the boundaries of the Reserves and provide a map showing the new boundaries and (b) to obtain detailed information regarding the proposal for constructing a road through the middle of the Talamanca-La Amistad Reserves, including an assessment of the potential impact of this project on the state of conservation of the site. \n &nbsp;
