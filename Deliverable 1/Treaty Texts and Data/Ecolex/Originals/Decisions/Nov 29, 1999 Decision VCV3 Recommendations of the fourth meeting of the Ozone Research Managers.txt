The  Conference of the Parties,  in  Decision VCV/3 of its Fifth Meeting,  decided:     To take note of the report of the fourth meeting of the Ozone Research Managers;   To endorse the recommendations of the fourth meeting of the Ozone Research Managers, as contained in the report WMO/UNEP, Report of the fourth meeting of the Ozone Research Managers, WMO Global Ozone Research and Monitoring Project, Report No. 45 to the fifth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention;   To request all Parties:     To continue to maintain instruments and develop the monitoring, calibration and archiving of measurements of stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, including measurements of vertical ozone profiles and of other trace species and aerosols that are essential and to pursue the development and implementation of new observational capabilities such as aircraft and satellite-based measurements hand-in-hand with an accelerated programme for ground-based instrument calibration;   To expand the ground-based ozone stations, especially in the continental part of Asia (e.g., Siberia), as well as in the Caribbean and Central American region;   To increase investigation and quantification of stratospheric and tropospheric processes through routine monitoring and experimental campaigns in order to understand current changes and to further develop and implement predictions of stratospheric change both for the short and long term;   To continue giving high priority to research into the interactions between ozone and climate and into the impact of aircraft emissions on ozone;   To request the World Meteorological Organization to continue to work towards improving the quality and compatibility of UV-B measurements and their archiving;   To enhance substantially research on the effects of ultraviolet radiation (UV-B), and efforts to monitor such effects;   To request the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme to pursue ways of enhancing training and baseline monitoring of ozone and UV-B radiation and related research in developing countries, bearing in mind that these goals can only be accomplished with assistance from international funding organizations such as the Global Environment Facility and with the direct support of the Parties to the Convention to such programmes through the appropriate mechanisms.
