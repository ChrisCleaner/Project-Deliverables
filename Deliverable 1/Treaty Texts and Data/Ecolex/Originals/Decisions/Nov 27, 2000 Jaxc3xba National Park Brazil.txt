Property:  Ja&uacute;   National Park    \n Id. N&deg;:  998  \n State Party:  Brazil    \n Criteria:  N (ii) (iv)   \n The Committee inscribed Ja&uacute; National Park on the World Heritage List under natural  criteria (ii) and (iv) . \n  Criteria (ii) and (iv) : The site protects a large and representative example of the Amazon Central Plain Forest including the entire hydrological basin of the Ja&uacute; River. The site is important for biodiversity, protecting a large portion of the biodiversity associated with the Blackwater River system - one of the three types of lymnological systems associated with the Amazon basin. The site has a sufficient size to allow the maintenance of significant on-going ecological and biological processes, such as blow downs, changes in the river flood dynamics and natural burns, thus providing unique opportunities to study their effect on biodiversity in natural ecosystems. \n The Observer of Brazil informed the Committee that his Government is committed to the protection of the Amazon system. \n &nbsp;
