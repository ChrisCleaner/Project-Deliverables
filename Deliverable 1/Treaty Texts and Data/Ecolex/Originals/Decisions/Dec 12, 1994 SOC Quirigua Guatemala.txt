Quirigua (Guatemala)  \n The Committee took note of a report presented by the UNDP/UNESCO Project which stated that the state of conservation of the site is very good, but that it had been demonstrated that the architecture and sculptures are subject to continuous, low-level erosion. In the mid-eighties thatch-roofed huts were built over the site\'s sculptures to protect them from rainfall. These do not, however, protect the sculptures from wind-blown rainfall. Furthermore, it was noted that the storage areas for excavated objects do not meet minimal conservation standards. \n It was recommended: - that the size of the thatched roofs be increased so as to provide better protection to the sculptures; - to examine the possibility of removing the sculptures to a site museum and to replace them by copies. A technical mission should be undertaken from Quirigua to Copan, Honduras to consult with the Copan personnel who recently successfully completed a similar effort; - that the conditions of the storage areas be improved. \n &nbsp;
