The World Heritage Committee, \n \n  Having examined  Documents WHC-15/39.COM/8B and WHC-15/39.COM/INF.8B1 ,  \n  Defers  the examination of the nomination of the  La Rioja and Rioja Alavesa Wine and Vineyard Cultural Landscape, Spain,  to the World Heritage List in order to allow the State Party, with the advice of ICOMOS and the World Heritage Centre, if requested, to deepen the study of the nominated property to bring into focus the areas of potential significance of the property in relation to its attributes and, if such a study suggests that a robust case could be made to justify the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, then reconsider the scope of the nomination in relation to the specificities of other vineyard cultural landscapes inscribed, or not, on the World Heritage List; \n  Considers  that any revised nomination would need to be considered by an expert mission to the site.
