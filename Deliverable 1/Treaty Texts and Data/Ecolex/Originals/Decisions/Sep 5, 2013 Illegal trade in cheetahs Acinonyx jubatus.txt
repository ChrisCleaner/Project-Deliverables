The study should aim to determine the source of cheetahs in illegal trade, and the transit routes of illegally trafficked cheetahs, and should document the measures taken by Parties to deal with or dispose of confiscated live specimens. All range States must be fully consulted as stakeholders. The Secretariat shall make the results of the study available to the Animals and Standing Committees for their consideration.
