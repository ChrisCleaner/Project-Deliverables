Noting  that Saudi Arabia ratified the Montreal Protocol, and the London and Copenhagen Amendments on 1 March 1993, and is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol,   Noting also  that the Executive Committee has approved $2,378,485 from the Multilateral Fund to enable Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol,     That Saudi Arabia has reported annual consumption for the controlled substances in Annex A, group I (chlorofluorocarbons), for 2007 of 657.8\xc2\xa0ODP-tonnes, which exceeds the Party\xe2\x80\x99s maximum allowable consumption of 269.8 ODP-tonnes for those controlled substances for that year, and that the Party is therefore in non compliance with the control measures for those substances under the Protocol for that year;   To request Saudi Arabia to submit to the Secretariat, as a matter of urgency and no later than 31\xc2\xa0March 2010, for consideration by the Implementation Committee at its next meeting, a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure the Party\xe2\x80\x99s prompt return to compliance;   To monitor closely the progress of Saudi Arabia with regard to the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons. To the degree that the Party is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Saudi Arabia should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet its commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance;   To caution Saudi Arabia, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner the Meeting of the Parties will consider measures consistent with item\xc2\xa0C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article\xc2\xa04, such as ensuring that the supply of the chlorofluorocarbons that are the subject of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance is ceased so that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance;
