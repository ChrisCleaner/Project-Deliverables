13. The President then explained for which reasons it was proposed to simplify the procedure in force for the election of members to the World Heritage Committee, in order to avoid an excessive number of ballots. This simplification, contained in the proposed amendments to Rules 13.8, 13.9 and 13.10 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly (cf. Document WHC-95/CONF.204/5), would comprise four ballots with absolute majority and at the fifth ballot a simple majority, and in the event of two or more candidates obtaining the same number of votes, to proceed by drawing lots.  14. The General Assembly rejected several additional amendments proposed during the session by delegations, comprising:     in the case of candidates obtaining the same number of votes, deferral of drawing of lots until the sixth ballot;   replacement of drawing of lots in the case of egality of votes by preference accorded to the State which had not yet been elected to the Committee;   interdiction of an outgoing Committee member to present its candidature for immediate re-election;   consideration as - invalid the ballot papers where the number of States marked is less than the seats to be filled.     Following these discussions, Rules 13.8, 13.9 and 13.10 as amended in the proposal contained in the Document WHC-95/CONF.204/5 were adopted by consensus, and Rule 13.4 was modified as follows:   "Each delegation shall cast its vote  by encircling the names  of those States for which it.... desires.... to vote."
