The Bureau recalled that the World Heritage Committee at its nineteenth session examined a monitoring report prepared by the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention. This report indicated that the new water control structure allowed for an inflow of water on a small scale and that a colony of the Dalmatian Pelican had been re-established. The report concluded, however, that the integrity of the site had not yet been adequately restored. The Committee, therefore, decided to retain the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger and requested the Bulgarian authorities to prepare a status report on their efforts to restore the site, to be presented in three years&rsquo; time. \n Pending the status report which the Committee requested the Bulgarian authorities to submit in 1998, the Bureau recommended the Committee to retain this property on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
