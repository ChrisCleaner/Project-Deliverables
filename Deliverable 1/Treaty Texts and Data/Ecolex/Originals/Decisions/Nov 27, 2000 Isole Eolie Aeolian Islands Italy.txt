Property:  Isole Eolie (Aeolian Islands)  \n Id. N&deg;:  908  \n State Party:  Italy    \n Criteria:  N (i)  \n The Committee inscribed the Aeolian Islands on the World Heritage List under natural  criterion (i) . \n  Criterion (i) : The volcanic landforms of the site represent classic features in the continuing study of volcanology worldwide. With their scientific study from at least the 18th Century, the islands have provided two of the types of eruptions (Vulcanian and Strombolian) to vulcanology and geology textbooks and so have featured prominently in the education of all geoscientists for over 200 years. They continue to provide a rich field for volcanological studies of on-going geological processes in the development of landforms. \n The Committee noted that the State Party has adequately responded to the issues raised at its twenty-third session and commended the State Party for further strengthening the nomination by simplifying the boundaries of the nominated area, creating a clear surrounding buffer zone and a co-ordinated management structure. \n A number of delegates supported the nomination and emhasized that the site is a textbook example of the world\'s volcanology. \n The Delegate of Italy stated that his authorities were happy to comply with all requests by Committee and that they were ready to cooperate with IUCN in the implementation of the management plan for the site. \n &nbsp;
