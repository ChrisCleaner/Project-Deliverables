The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/39:      To recall that in its decision XIV/23 the Fourteenth Meeting of the Parties noted that Nepal\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for Annex A, group I substances is 27 ODP-tonnes. Nepal reported consumption of 94 ODP-tonnes of Annex A, group I substances in 2000 and consumption of 94 ODP-tonnes of Annex A, group I substances for the consumption freeze control period of 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001. As a consequence, for the July 2000-June 2001 control period Nepal was in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2A of the Montreal Protocol;   To note that Nepal has subsequently reported that 74 ODP-tonnes of imports of CFCs have been detained by its customs authorities as the shipment lacked an import license, and that Nepal therefore wished to report the quantity as illegal trade under the terms of decision XIV/7;   To congratulate Nepal on its actions in seizing the shipment and in reporting the fact to the Secretariat;   To note also, however, that paragraph 7 of decision XIV/7 provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe illegally traded quantities should not be counted against a Party\xe2\x80\x99s consumption provided the Party does not place the said quantities on its own market\xe2\x80\x9d   To conclude, therefore, that if Nepal decides to release any of the seized quantity of CFCs into its domestic market, it would be considered to be in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2A of the Montreal Protocol and would therefore be required to fulfil the terms of decision XIV/23, including submitting to the Implementation Committee a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance;   To request the Implementation Committee to review the situation of Nepal at its next meeting.
