The Bureau expressed concern following the report presenting the different threats to the integrity of the site of P&eacute;tra, especially with regard to: \n 1) the serious impact of some ten new hotels planned or under construction, both on the visitor capacity of the site, their visibility from the site and the disproportion of several of them in relation to the village habitations, the destruction of archaeological vestiges which they cause, pollution and soil erosion; \n 2) the negative impact of the pumping station planned for Wadi Musa and its new hotels; \n 3) the risks caused to the site by projects for the development of residential zones such as those included in the master plan of Wadi Musa, as well as the absence of building specifications and building height restrictions; \n 4) the necessity of applying existing legislation governing businesses, especially in the proximity of the monuments of the site; \n 5) the necessity of ensuring proper conservation of the vestiges of the Temple of the Lion and the sculptured blocks scattered throughout the site. \n The Bureau agreed to a contribution from the World Heritage Fund to organize, together with the Jordanian authorities, a select meeting of experts at the site to implement the master plan of the site of P&eacute;tra as quickly as possible, and to take the necessary measures to ensure by all possible means the preservation of the values of the site.
