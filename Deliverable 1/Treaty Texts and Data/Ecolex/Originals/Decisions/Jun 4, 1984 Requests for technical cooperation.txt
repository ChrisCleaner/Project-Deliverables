31. The Bureau  regretted  the decrease in the amounts of the World Heritage Fund which limited its impact, particularly in the field. This would decrease the visibility of the Convention and thereby the support from those involved in the protection of the World Heritage properties themselves. \n In this connection, the Bureau  encouraged  the Secretariat, in cooperation with ICOMOS and IUCN, to seek where possible other sources of funding to synergetically support World Heritage technical cooperation projects. \n As regards training, the Bureau  recommended  that maximum use be made of the fellowship programmes and training facilities offered by many States Parties. \n &nbsp;
