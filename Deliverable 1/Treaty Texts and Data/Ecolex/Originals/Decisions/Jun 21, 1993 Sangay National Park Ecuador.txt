Noting that the Ecuadorean authorities have not yet provided the information requested by the Committee, the Bureau requested the Centre to contact them once again and obtain information on the status of the road construction project and on-going efforts to assess its impact on the integrity of the site. In accordance with the recommendations of the Committee, the Bureau also invited the Ecuadorean authorities to consider (a) submitting a proposal to extend this World Heritage site to include new areas that have been added to the Park, and (b) inviting a mission comprising regional experts to assess the severity of the threats faced by this site and plan remedial action. The Bureau requested the Centre to report on the implementation of the Committee\'s recommendation to the seventeenth session of the Committee, scheduled to be convened during December 1993.
