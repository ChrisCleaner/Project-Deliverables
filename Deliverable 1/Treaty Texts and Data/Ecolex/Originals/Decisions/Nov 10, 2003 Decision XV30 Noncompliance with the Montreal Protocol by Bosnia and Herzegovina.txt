The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/30:      To note that, in accordance with decision XIV/21 of the Fourteenth Meeting of the Parties, Bosnia and Herzegovina was requested to submit to the Implementation Committee a plan of action, with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance;   To note with appreciation Bosnia and Herzegovina\xe2\x80\x99s submission of its plan of action, and to note further that, under the plan, Bosnia and Herzegovina specifically commits itself:     To reducing CFC consumption from 243.6 ODP-tonnes in 2002 as follows:     To 235.3 ODP-tonnes in 2003;   To 167 ODP-tonnes in 2004;   To 102.1 ODP-tonnes in 2005;   To 33 ODP-tonnes in 2006;   To 3 ODP-tonnes in 2007;   To phasing out CFC consumption by 1 January 2008, as provided in the plan for reduction and phase-out of CFC consumption, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To reducing methyl bromide consumption from 11.8 ODP-tonnes in 2002, as follows:     To 5.61 ODP-tonnes in 2005 and in 2006;   To phasing out methyl bromide consumption by 1 January 2007, as provided in the plan for reduction and phase-out of methyl bromide consumption, save for critical uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To establishing, by 2004, a system for licensing imports and exports of ODS, including quotas;   To banning, by 2006, imports of ODS-using equipment;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 2 above should enable Bosnia and Herzegovina to return to compliance by 2008, and to urge Bosnia and Herzegovina to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase out consumption of ozone-depleting substances in Annex A, group I and Annex E;   To monitor closely the progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of CFCs and methyl bromide. To the degree that Bosnia and Herzegovina is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Bosnia and Herzegovina should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Bosnia and Herzegovina, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of CFCs and methyl bromide (that is, the subjects of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
