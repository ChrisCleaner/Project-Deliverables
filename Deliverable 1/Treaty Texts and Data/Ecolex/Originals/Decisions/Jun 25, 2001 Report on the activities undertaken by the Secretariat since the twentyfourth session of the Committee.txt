A meeting of a small Drafting Group to prepare the revision of the&nbsp;&nbsp;   Operational Guidelines      will be held at   UNESCO Headquarters from 8 to 12 October 2001 instead of 10-14 September 2001 as originally arranged. \n On an exceptional basis, the Bureau  decided  to allocate the sum of  US$30,000  from the World Heritage Fund in 2001 (Chapter III &ndash; International Assistance) for the organisation of the meeting of the Drafting Group.
