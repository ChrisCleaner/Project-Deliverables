The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-11/35.COM/7B, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  32 COM 7B.8 , adopted at its 32nd session (Quebec City, 2008), \n 3.  Commends  the State Party for the progress made in addressing land tenure issues by integrating pastoral lands into the buffer zone, thereby enlarging it and increasing the protection of the property, and  notes  the steps taken to support traditional Aboriginal communities within this buffer zone; \n 4.  Encourages  the State Party to develop an interim management plan, in order to give due consideration to the property\'s indigenous cultural values while the native title case is ongoing, and to address traditional landowners\' concerns, by considering potential stricter regulations on tourism access to culturally significant sites; \n 5.  Also notes  that there are a number of threats, including fire, feral cattle and invasive species, that could potentially impact wilderness values that are relevant to the property\'s Outstanding Universal Value in relation to criterion (vii), and  requests  the State Party to address these issues by continuing the application of prescribed fires to reduce hot fires at the end of the dry season, continuing to actively reduce the population of feral cattle, and collaborating with NGOs to explore and enhance invasive species response strategies; \n 6.  Further requests  the State Party to ensure that all mining operations adjacent to the property should be subject to the highest standards of environmental impact assessment, including consideration of the likely impacts of these activities on the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n 7.  Also requests  the State Party to keep the World Heritage Centre informed on the progress made in implementing the above.
