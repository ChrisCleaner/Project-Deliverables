20.   Under item 9 of the agenda "Other business", the representative of Tunisia launched an appeal for assistance in favour of the site of Tipasa, inscribed on the World Heritage List, which has recently suffered from an earthquake. Several delegates gave their support and expressed the desire that the World Heritage Committee examine this question during its forthcoming meeting. The Secretariat then specified that a request by Algeria for emergency assistance could be submitted at any time and would be examined without delay. The delegate of Thailand, for his part, wished that the state of accounts of the World Heritage Fund should be presented with more details at subsequent General Assemblies.
