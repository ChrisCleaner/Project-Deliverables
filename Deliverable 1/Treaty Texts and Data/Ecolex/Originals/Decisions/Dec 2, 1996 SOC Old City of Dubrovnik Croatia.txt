VII.2S Old City of Dubrovnik (Croatia)  \n On September 5, 1996, the area of Dubrovnik was hit by an earthquake. In response to a request from the Croatian authorities, a fact-finding mission was sent to Dubrovnik late November to survey the effects of the earthquake. The expert mission reported that the earthquake caused minimum damage in Dubrovnik. Only some cracks dating back to the earthquake of 1979 had deteriorated. \n Very serious damage, however, was caused to the historical town of Ston, which is on the Croatian Tentative List. Inside the city walls nearly all buildings were damaged and several of them had collapsed. The Committee expressed its concern about the state of conservation of the town of Ston. \n As to Dubrovnik, the Committee requested the State Party to submit, by 15 September 1997, an overall state of conservation report, in order for the Committee to consider at its twenty-first session whether Dubrovnik could be deleted from the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
