This site was inscribed in 1987. The MAP/UNEP Coordinator of the 100 historical sites" Programme informed the Bureau that the Technical and Scientific Committee created in 1988 and which was responsible for evaluating the security of the Tower of Pisa, did remarkable work. A series of enquiries, measures and studies were undertaken to obtain information on all the physico&shy;mechanical characteristics of the substratum, and to make various hypotheses of structural evolution. The intervention approved by the Technical Committee in the spring of 1992 necessitated the development of a numerical model of finite elements of the substratum and the structure. The Committee retained the solution to reduce the inclination of the tower by 1/2 degree. \n The Bureau noted with satisfaction this information.
