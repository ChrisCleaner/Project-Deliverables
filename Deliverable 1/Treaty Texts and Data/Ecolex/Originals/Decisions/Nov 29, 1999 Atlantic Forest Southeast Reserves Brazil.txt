Property:  Atlantic   Forest   Southeast Reserves  \n Id. N&deg;:  893-894Rev  \n State Party:  Brazil    \n Criteria:  N(ii) (iii) (iv)  \n IUCN informed the Committee that the evaluation of this property has been undertaken based on the revised nomination submitted by the State Party in April 1999. \n The Atlantic Forest Southeast Reserves contain the best and largest remaining examples of Atlantic forest in the Southeast region of Brazil. The 25 protected areas that make up the site display the biological richness and evolutionary history of the few remaining areas of Atlantic forest of Southeast Brazil. The area is also exceptionally diverse with high numbers of rare and endemic species. With its "mountains to the sea" attitudinal gradient, its estuary, wild rivers, karst and numerous waterfalls, the site also has exceptional scenic values. \n The Committee decided to inscribe the site under natural  criteria (ii), (iii)  and  (iv) . It also recommended that the State Party should be encouraged to restore natural conditions in the Serra do Mar State Park, which potentially could be incorporated in the site. \n The Delegate of Morocco noted the values of the site but highlighted the challenges of the management of serial sites. The Delegate of Australia noted that management in serial sites is complex but can be done with careful strategic planning and an appropriate legal framework. \n &nbsp;
