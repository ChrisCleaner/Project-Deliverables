The World Heritage Committee, \n \n  Having examined  Document WHC-14/38.COM/7B, \n  Recalling  Decision  36 COM 7B.29 , adopted at its 36th session (Saint-Petersburg, 2012), \n  Notes  that the construction of the Baixo Igua\xc3\xa7u Hydroelectric Project has been suspended due to major flooding in the surroundings of the property on 7-9 June 2014, which has paralyzed the project, and that the State Party has confirmed that the construction licence for the project has been declared invalid; \n  Requests  the State Party to provide the World Heritage Centre with a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in accordance with Paragraph 172 of the  Operational Guidelines , and in conformity with IUCN\xe2\x80\x99s World Heritage advice note on Environmental Assessment, to assist the State Party on the re-evaluation of the Baixo Igua\xc3\xa7u Hydroelectric project, prior to any further authorisation of construction; \n  Also notes with significant concern  that proposed Bill 7123/2010, currently under consideration by the Brazilian Congress, represents a continued risk that the "Settler\'s Road" might be re-opened, and  recalls  that the illegal opening of the road in 1997 led the Committee to inscribe the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger; \n  Considers  that a re-opening of the \xe2\x80\x9cSettler\xe2\x80\x99s Road\xe2\x80\x9d or the continued construction of the Baixo Igua\xc3\xa7u Hydroelectric Project prior to an assessment of impacts on the property\xe2\x80\x99s Outstanding Universal Value having been completed, could create the conditions to re-inscribe the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger in line with Paragraph 180 of the  Operational Guidelines ; \n  Expresses its concern  about the changes to federal protected area legislation as proposed in Bill 7123/2010, which would enable road construction in protected areas, and which could also impact on other World Heritage properties in Brazil, and  urges  the State Party to rigorously ensure that road construction in World Heritage properties affected by this Bill remains prohibited by law; \n  Reiterates its request  to the States Parties of Brazil and Argentina to foster transboundary cooperation between the two contiguous properties of Igua\xc3\xa7u National Park and Iguaz\xc3\xba National Park, in order to politically confirm and technically guide cooperation and coordination; \n  Also requests  the State Party to ensure reinforced coordination with the State Party of Argentina in updating both management plans, addressing in particular conservation financing, law enforcement, alien invasive species, public use, communication, education and awareness; \n  Further request  the State Party of Brazil to invite an IUCN reactive monitoring mission to the property to assess the status and potential impact of the Baixo Igua\xc3\xa7u dam and the overall state of conservation of the property, including the area previously affected by the \xe2\x80\x9cSettler\xe2\x80\x99s Road\xe2\x80\x9d; \n  Further requests  the State Party to submit by  1 February 2015  to the World Heritage Centre, a progress report on the implementation of the above and, in consultation with the State Party of Argentina, by  1 December 2015  an updated report, including a 1-page executive summary, on the state of conservation of the property for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 40th session in 2016.
