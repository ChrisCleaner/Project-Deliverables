The World Heritage Committee, \n \n  Commends  the State Party for providing information on the current status on actions taken to mitigate illegal fishing and for launching studies that may enable comparative analysis of current ecological conditions with those at the time of inscription of the property on the World Heritage List; and  congratulates  the State Party for the comprehensive state of conservation report received 15 June 2004 as well as for the conservation actions taken to date to conserve the property; \n  Notes  that the major threats facing the Tubbataha Reef are related to:\n \n the lack of sufficient resources for the management of the property, \n national and international illegal fishing activities, which in turn have strong connection with poverty as well as to insufficient law enforcement, and \n lack of awareness. Future threats for the site include shipping, oil exploration and potential growth of tourism; \n \n \n 3.
