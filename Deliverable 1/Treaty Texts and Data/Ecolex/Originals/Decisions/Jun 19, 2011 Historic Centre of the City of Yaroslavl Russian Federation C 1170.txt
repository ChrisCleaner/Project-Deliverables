Reiterates its utmost concern  about the lack of follow-up in response to the 2009 reactive monitoring mission recommendations, and in particular the: \n a) establishment and approval, in conformity with the official juridical documents, of the process of review and delivery of the building permissions within the boundary of the property and its buffer zone, \n b) official submission of all projects which could impact on the Outstanding Universal Value of the property to the World Heritage Centre, for review, prior to any approval and delivery of the building permissions, \n c) transparency of the planning and decision making processes, \n d) designation by the Federal authorities of the administration in charge of the process of monitoring of the state of conservation of the property, \n e) adequate human resources for the management and monitoring of the property, \n f) establishment of a limitation for excessive use and opening of underground spaces within the boundaries of the World Heritage property and its buffer zone, \n g) avoidance of the use of new and inappropriate materials (such as metal and glass) as main materials on the facades, \n h) implementation of restrictions of outdoor advertisements; \n 5.

Strongly urges  the State Party to establish an appropriate management system for the property to handle planning permissions in a clear and transparent manner, and to ensure that there is an effective coordination between the authorities concerned and stakeholders; \n 7.  Expresses serious concern  that the ongoing changes to the horizontal urban skyline, and the quantity and scale of new construction and development projects within the property have had a negative impact on the urban planning scheme of the 18th century and the architectural monuments of the 16th and 17th centuries, and therefore constituting an ascertained threat to the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n 8.  Also requests  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre/ICOMOS reactive monitoring mission to the Historic Centre of Yaroslavl to assess the state of conservation of the property. This mission should also review the existing management system and decision-making mechanism for the property, including legislative and regulatory framework, institutional arrangements and existing planning tools; \n 9.
