The Old City of Dubrovnik (Croatia)  \n The Secretariat recalled action undertaken by UNESCO in cooperation with Croatian specialists, and indicated that the brochures prepared jointly with national authorities proved to be an excellent promotional support. A number of safeguarding measures were taken: \n \n a restoration methodology was defined; \n training courses were organized in France and Italy for Croatian architects; \n equipment and materials were purchased for the restoration of roofs. \n \n These UNESCO activities, undertaken in liaison with the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments of Dubrovnik, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and the UNESCO National Commission, should be reinforced through support under the World Heritage Fund. \n At the request of the Committee at its sixteenth session, the Croatian authorities submitted a proposal for the extension of the World Heritage site. This was discussed by the Bureau at its seventeenth extraordinary session, and it was decided to defer this proposal until the Croatian authorities also submit, as requested, a proposal for a buffer zone. \n &nbsp;
