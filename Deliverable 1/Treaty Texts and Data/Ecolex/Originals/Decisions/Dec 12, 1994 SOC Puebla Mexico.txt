Puebla   (Mexico)  \n The Committee recalled that a rehabilitation plan for a part of the World Heritage site of Puebla, the Rio de San Francisco area, was briefly discussed at its seventeenth session and that more detailed information was provided at the eighteenth session of the Bureau on the basis of a report from the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) and the report of a UNESCO expert in urban rehabilitation and conservation who visited Puebla in June 1994. \n The Committee was informed that following the eighteenth session of the Bureau and on the request of the Government of Mexico, the same expert had undertaken a series of missions to Puebla to advise the authorities in the preparation of the urban development plan for the Rio de San Francisco area. The Committee commended the authorities of Mexico, the state of Puebla and the Municipality of Puebla on their positive response to the expert\'s advice, and invited them to report on a regular basis to the Secretariat on the further development of this project. \n &nbsp;
