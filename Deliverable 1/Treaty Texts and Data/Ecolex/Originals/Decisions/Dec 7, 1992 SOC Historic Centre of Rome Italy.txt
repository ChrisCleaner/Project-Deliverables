Historic Centre of Rome (Italy)  \n The ICOMOS Representative informed the Committee of the state of the Rome Colisseum which is suffering both from air pollution due to the proximity of a road and from vibrations caused by the subway. At present financial support from the Banco de Roma is enabling conservation work of the monument to ensure its safeguard. \n The Delegate of Italy intervened to thank ICOMOS for the scientific information presented to the Committee and which recalled the usual problems dealt with concerning catastrophes, but in this case the problem of the Colisseum is the harmful daily effects on the monument. \n However, it will be possible to implement projects to consolidate and protect the stone due to the provision of exceptional financial resources, from the Banco de Roma, and ICOMOS and the Committee will be kept informed of progress. Moreover, prior to any intervention, the Italian authorities have initiated a systematic process to analyze materials, and have set up a scientific committee which will co-operate with ICCROM and ICOMOS. \n In addition, the Delegate of Italy stated that, in general, it was necessary to request States Parties to provide periodic information to the World Heritage Centre on interventions anticipated in inscribed properties so as not merely to evaluate a  fait accompli  but rather to undertake preventive action. \n &nbsp;
