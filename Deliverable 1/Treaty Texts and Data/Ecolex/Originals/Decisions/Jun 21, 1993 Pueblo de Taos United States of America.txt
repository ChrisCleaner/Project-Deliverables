ICOMOS informed of a letter recently received from the Pueblo Governing Council. ICOMOS reviewed the concerns of the Tribal authorities over proposals to extend the runway of the Taos, New Mexico, Airport and confirmed that such action could pose serious problems for the protection of the site and its environment, as well as traditional lifestyles of the Taos people. The Bureau agreed with this assessment and requested the Secretariat to convey its concerns to the U.S. authorities together with a request for additional information.
