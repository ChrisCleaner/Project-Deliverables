The  Ninth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. IX/28:      To note with appreciation the work done by the Implementation Committee and the Secretariat on the review and redesign of the formats for reporting data under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol;   To note that the issue of reporting data is an important one and that it is an area to which the Parties may consider giving greater consideration;   To approve the revised forms for reporting data prepared according to the reporting mandates of the Protocol. The data forms are set out in annex VII to the report of the Ninth Meeting of the Parties;   To recall decision IV/10 and decision IX/17, paragraph 3 (b), and request TEAP, in cooperation with the UNEP Industry and Environment Centre, to prepare a list of mixtures known to contain controlled substances and the percentage proportions of those substances. In particular, the list should provide information on refrigerant mixtures and solvents. It should report this information to the Parties at the seventeenth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group, and annually thereafter;   To request UNEP Industry and Environment Centre to draw on its existing reports and its OzonAction Information Clearing-house (OAIC) diskette database, and, in collaboration with the other Implementing Agencies and the Secretariat of the Multilateral Fund, prepare a handbook on data-reporting which will provide information to the Parties to assist all Parties with data-reporting. This information should include techniques for data collection, trade names, as identified by TEAP, customs codes (where these exist), and advice on what sectors of industry may be using these products;   To stipulate that, for the purpose of the data-collection only, when reporting data on the consumption of methyl bromide for quarantine and pre-shipment applications, the Parties shall report the amount consumed (i.e., import plus production minus export) and not actual \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d   To note that the revised data forms in annex VII to the report of the Ninth Meeting of the Parties, when completed, largely fulfil the reporting requirements under the Montreal Protocol, excluding those for essential-use exemptions.
