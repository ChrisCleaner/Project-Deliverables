It is also an extraordinary example for interchange of human values in the form of scientific collaboration among scientists from different countries. It is at the same time an example for collaboration between monarchs of different powers, for a scientific cause.   Criterion (iv):  The Struve Geodetic Arc is undoubtedly an outstanding example of technological ensemble - presenting the triangulation points of the measuring of the meridian, being the non movable and non tangible part of the measuring technology.   Criterion (vi):  The measuring of the arc and its results are directly associated with men wondering about his world, its shape and size. It is linked with Sir Isaac Newton\'s theory that the world is not an exact sphere.  3.
