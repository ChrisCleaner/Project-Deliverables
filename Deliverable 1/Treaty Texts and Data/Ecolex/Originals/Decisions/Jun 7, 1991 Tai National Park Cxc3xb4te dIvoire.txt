The Bureau noted with satisfaction that this Park benefitted from strong support of German and WWF co-operation for research and conservation of the site, and in the future, incorporation of its peripheral zones in an integrated development plan. But the site was under threat from poachers and from the arrival in the area of refugees from Liberia. Consequently the Bureau wished to encourage the C&ocirc;te d\'Ivoire\'s partners to back up the existing project by making use of the work already done by the Tai research station in the context of UNESCO\'s Man and the Biosphere project (MAB).
