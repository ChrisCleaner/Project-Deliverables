XIII.13  Proposed Workplan for 1997 and provisional budgetfor 1998 \n Whilst regretting that the details and explanations provided by the Centre relating to the use of the funds foreseen in the Workplan for 1997 were insufficient, the delegates questioned the structure of the budget and the allocation of funds. Thus, the following decisions were taken: \n a) the budget for 1997 is increased to US$ 3.5 million instead of US$ 3.3 million originally foreseen; b) the funds allocated for the twenty-fifth anniversary celebrations of the Convention (US$ 40,000 in Chapter I and US$ 100,000 in Chapter V) are allocated for other purposes, of which an amount of US$ 120,000 for the Evaluation of the Administrative Management of the World Heritage Centre, placed in Chapter I); c) increasing Chapter 11 to respond to demands of the advisory bodies and a new item inserted "Other bodies and individuals"; d) increasing preparatory assistance and training in Chapter III; e) increasing funds foreseen to support States Parties in monitoring and reporting, in Chapter IV;| f) Chapter V remains at the same level as in 1996, with the elimination of the item on the twenty-fifth anniversary and the strengthening of educational activities. \n The budget below was approved unanimously. \n &nbsp;
