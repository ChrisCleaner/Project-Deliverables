Noting with appreciation  the work of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee,    Recognizing  the significant reductions in critical-use nominations for methyl bromide by many parties,    Recalling  paragraph 10 of decision XVII/9,    Recalling also  that all parties that have nominated critical-use exemptions are to report data on stocks of methyl bromide using the accounting framework agreed to by the Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties,    Recalling further  paragraph 1 of decision XXV/4, in which the Meeting of the Parties requested that, by the thirty-sixth meeting[1] of the Open-ended Working Group, Australia submit the available results of its research programme,    Noting with appreciation  that, in accordance with paragraph 2 of decision XXV/4, Canada submitted the available results of its assessment of the impact of chloropicrin on groundwater to the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel in August 2015,    Recognizing  that the production and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses should be permitted only if methyl bromide is not available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled methyl bromide,    Recognizing also  that parties operating under critical-use exemptions should take into account the extent to which methyl bromide is available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled methyl bromide in licensing, permitting or authorizing the production and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses ,    1. To permit, for the agreed critical-use categories for 2016 and 2017 set forth in table A of the annex to the present decision for each party, subject to the conditions set forth in the present decision and in decision Ex.I/4 to the extent that those conditions are applicable, the levels of production and consumption for 2016 and 2017 set forth in table B of the annex to the present decision, which are necessary to satisfy critical uses, with the understanding that additional levels of production and consumption and categories of use may be approved by the Meeting of the Parties in accordance with decision IX/6;   2. That parties shall endeavour to license, permit, authorize or allocate quantities of methyl bromide for critical uses as listed in table A of the annex to the present decision;   3. That each party that has an agreed critical-use exemption shall renew its commitment to ensuring that the criteria in paragraph 1 of decision IX/6, in particular the criterion laid down in paragraph 1 (b) (ii) of decision IX/6, are applied in licensing, permitting or authorizing critical uses of methyl bromide, with each party requested to report on the implementation of the present provision to the Ozone Secretariat by 1 February for the years to which the present decision applies;   Annex to decision XXVII/3   Table A   Agreed critical-use categories   (Metric tonnes)       2017   \xc2\xa0       Australia   Strawberry runners 29.760       2016   \xc2\xa0       Argentina   Strawberry fruit 71.25 ; tomato 58       China   Ginger, protected 21.0 ; ginger, open field 78.75       Mexico   Strawberry, nursery 43.539 ; raspberry, nursery 41.418       South Africa   Mills 5.462 ; houses 68.6       Table B   Permitted levels of production and consumption a    (Metric tonnes)       2017   \xc2\xa0       Australia   29.760       2016   \xc2\xa0       Argentina   129.25       China   99.75       Mexico   84.957       South Africa   74.062        a  Minus available stocks.
