The Committee discussed the need to increase the number of officers constituting the Bureau in view of the greater workload of the Bureau in the future. Committee members also felt that a larger number of officers would be advisable to allow for: \n (i) better representation of geographical regions in the Bureau; and, (ii) enhanced expertise for both natural and cultural properties. \n Having also in mind that the membership of the Committee itself would be increased from 15 to 21 delegates at the second General Assembly, the Committee agreed to elect henceforth 7 officers for the Bureau which would then consist of the Chairman, five Vice-Chairmen and the Rapporteur. \n &nbsp;
