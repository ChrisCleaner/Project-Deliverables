The Bureau expressed its concern regarding the protection of Megalithic temples and requested the World Heritage Centre to draw the attention of the competent Maltese authorities to the necessity of establishing a larger buffer zone with better legal protection. A report on the information received will be submitted to the Committee at its next session, particularly in the light of a proposal for extension of this site presented by the Maltese authorities this year.
