Noting with appreciation  the work of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee,    Recognizing  the significant reductions made in critical-use nominations for methyl bromide by many parties,    Recalling  paragraph 10 of decision XVII/9,    Recalling also  that all parties that have nominated critical-use exemptions are to report data on stocks using the accounting framework agreed to by the Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties,    Recognizing  that the production and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses should be permitted only if methyl bromide is not available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled methyl bromide,    Recognizing also  that parties operating under critical-use exemptions should take into account the extent to which methyl bromide is available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled methyl bromide in licensing, permitting or authorizing the production and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses,    Recognizing further  that soilless systems for strawberry runners are economically and technically feasible and in use in many countries, but are not yet economically and technically feasible throughout Australia,    Recognizing  that Australia has a research programme to identify technically and economically feasible alternatives to methyl bromide for strawberry runners,    Recognizing also  that technically and economically feasible alternatives, including soilless culture systems, are currently not available for the production of strawberry runners in Prince Edward Island, Canada,    Recognizing further  that Canada will proceed with its assessment of the impact of chloropicrin on groundwater in Prince Edward Island, Canada,    Acknowledging  that the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, and specifically its Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee, produces reports that are science-based, independent and robust, and that all parties should strive to respect the results of that work,   1. To request that Australia submit, by the thirty-sixth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group, the available results of its research programme to the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel for its consideration;   2. To request that Canada submit, by the thirty-sixth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group, the available results of its assessment of the impact of chloropicrin on groundwater to the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel for its consideration;   3. To consider approving a critical-use nomination for the strawberry sector in California, United States of America, in 2014, and to approve sufficient methyl bromide for use in 2016 to enable that sector to complete its intended transition from critical uses for methyl bromide by the end of 2016;   4. To permit, for the agreed critical-use categories for 2015 set forth in table A of the annex to the present decision for each party, subject to the conditions set forth in the present decision and in decision Ex.I/4 to the extent that those conditions are applicable, the levels of production and consumption for 2015 set forth in table B of the annex to the present decision, which are necessary to satisfy critical uses, with the understanding that additional levels of production and consumption and categories of use may be approved by the Meeting of the Parties in accordance with decision IX/6;   5. That parties shall endeavour to license, permit, authorize or allocate quantities of methyl bromide for critical uses as listed in table A of the annex to the present decision;   6. That each party that has an agreed critical-use exemption shall renew its commitment to ensuring that the criteria in paragraph 1 of decision IX/6, in particular the criterion laid down in paragraph 1 (b) (ii) of decision IX/6, are applied in licensing, permitting or authorizing critical uses of methyl bromide, with each party requested to report on the implementation of the present provision to the Ozone Secretariat by 1 February for the years to which the present decision applies;   7. To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to ensure that its consideration of nominations analyses the impact of national, subnational and local regulations and law on the potential use of methyl bromide alternatives and to include a description of the analysis in the critical-use nomination report;   Annex to decision XXV/4 : Critical use exemptions   Table A    Agreed critical-use categories for 2015    (Metric tonnes)       Australia   Strawberry runners 29.760       Canada   Strawberry runners (Prince Edward Island) 5.261       United States of America   Strawberry field 373.66, cured pork 3.24       Table B    Permitted levels of production and consumption for 2015    (Metric tonnes)       Australia   29.760       Canada   5.261       United States of America   376.90 a         a  Minus available stocks.
