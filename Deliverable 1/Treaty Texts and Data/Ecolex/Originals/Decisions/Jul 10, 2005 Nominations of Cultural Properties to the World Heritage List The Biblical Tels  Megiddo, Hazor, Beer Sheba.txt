The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Documents   WHC-05/29.COM/8B, WHC-05/29.COM/8B.Add 2   and   WHC-05/29.COM/INF.8B.1  , \n 2.  Inscribes   The Biblical Tels and Ancient Water Systems - Megiddo, Hazor  &nbsp;and Beer Sheba&nbsp; (Israel) on the World Heritage List on the basis of cultural criteria (ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi): \n  Criterion (ii):  The three tels represent an interchange of human values throughout the ancient near-east, forged through extensive trade routes and alliances with other states and manifest in building styles which merged Egyptian, Syrian and Aegean influences to create a distinctive local style. \n  Criterion (iii ): The three tels are a testimony to a civilisation that has disappeared -that of the Cananean cities of the Bronze Age and the biblical cities of the Iron Age-, manifest in their expressions of creativity: town planning, fortifications, palaces, and water collection technologies. \n  Criterion (iv):  The biblical cities exerted a powerful influence on later history through the biblical narrative. \n  Criterion (vi):  The three tels, through their mentions in the Bible, constitute a religious and spiritual testimony of outstanding universal value. \n 3.
