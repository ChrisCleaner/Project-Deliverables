World Heritage sites in Mexico: \n The Observer of Mexico informed the Bureau that the Mexican National Institute for Anthropology and History (INAH) prepared state of conservation reports on the ten cultural and natural sites that were inscribed on the World Heritage List until 1992. He emphasized that Mexico has taken this initiative as it feels that it is an integral element of the implementation of the World Heritage Convention in the country and that it is one of the obligations of the States Parties to the Convention to report on the state of conservation of the sites and on the actions taken by them to ensure their adequate protection and conservation. The Observer announced that the report is now available in Spanish and that a translation into English and/or French is forthcoming. The Bureau thanked the Mexican authorities for this initiative and requested the World Heritage Centre and ICOMOS to evaluate the report for presentation to the eighteenth session of the World Heritage Committee.
