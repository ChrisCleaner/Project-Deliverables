The Bureau recalled that the situation regarding the proposed airport extension in the vicinity of the Taos Pueblo site had been discussed by the Committee and the Bureau over the last several years. \n The Bureau was informed that a preliminary monitoring report from the United States National Park Service indicated that no agreement had been reached as of yet between the Federal Aviation Administration, the Taos Pueblo and the National Park Service on the definition of the geographic area of potential impacts and on the contents of the Environmental Impact Statement. As to the recommendations made by the Committee at its nineteenth session regarding the involvement of ICOMOS and IUCN in the definition of the Impact Statement area, as well as a possible extension of the site, the report indicated that these will have to move forward in full consultation with the Pueblo, which is self-governing. \n The Bureau took note of the information provided by the United States National Park Service in response to the World Heritage Committee\'s recommendation regarding the Environmental Impact Statement that is to be undertaken in relation to the proposed extension of the Taos airport. It requested the authorities to keep the Committee informed of any progress made in these matters.
