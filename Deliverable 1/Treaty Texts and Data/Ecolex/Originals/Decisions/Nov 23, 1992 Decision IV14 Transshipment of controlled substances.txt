The  Fourth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. IV/14  to clarify Article 7 of the amended Protocol so that it is understood to mean that, in cases of transshipment of controlled substances through a third country (as opposed to imports and subsequent re-exports), the country of origin of the controlled substances shall be regarded as the exporter and the country of final destination shall be regarded as the importer. In such cases, the responsibility for reporting data shall lie with the country of origin as the exporter and the country of final destination as the importer. Cases of import and re-export should be treated as two separate transactions; the country of origin would report shipment to the country of intermediate destination, which would subsequently report the import from the country of origin and export to the country of final destination, while the country of final destination would report the import.
