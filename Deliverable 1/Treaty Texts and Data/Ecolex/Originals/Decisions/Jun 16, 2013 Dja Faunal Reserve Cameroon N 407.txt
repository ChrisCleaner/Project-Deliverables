Further requests   the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by   1&nbsp;February&nbsp;2014   , a detailed report on the state of conservation of the property, especially on progress made in mitigating threats to the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 38th session in 2014.&nbsp;
