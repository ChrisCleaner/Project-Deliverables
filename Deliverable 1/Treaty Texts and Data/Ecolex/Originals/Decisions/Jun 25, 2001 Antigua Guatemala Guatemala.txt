V.246&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The World Heritage Centre informed the Bureau that it had received a report on the damage caused by the earthquake that struck Central America on 13 January 2001. The tremors aggravated damage already experienced in 1976 and caused moderate damage but heightened the danger of collapse for some of the buildings. The Centre is currently discussing an emergency assistance request with the State Party. \n V.247&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICOMOS reported on the results of an expert mission, which evaluated the impacts of the construction of a shopping centre on the property&rsquo;s universal values, as well as its general state of conservation. The Advisory Body informed the Bureau that the building project was definitely suspended, but indicated that there were more general legislative problems, as well as pressures due to tourism and development. The lack of a buffer zone was also highlighted. The efforts of the State Party to address these problems were commended. The complete report will be submitted to the State Party for comment by the 15 September 2001 to be reported to the twenty-fifth extraordinary session of the Bureau.
