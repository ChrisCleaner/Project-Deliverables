Brasilia   (Brazil)  \n The protected zone of Brasilia named "El Poligono" was deemed well preserved in spite of considerable population growth. Conservation interests and urban development have to be fully integrated. The Committee was informed that Brazil intends to organize and host an international forum on the conservation of this 35-year old city. The Committee welcomed this important and appropriate initiative. \n &nbsp;
