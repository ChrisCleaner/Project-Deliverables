Notes  the actions of the State Party in response to the World Heritage Committee\'s requests in developing a management plan; \n 4.  Thanks the State Party for aiming to develop general methodologies for assessing the impact of development on views from and to World Heritage properties which may become a basis for further discussion on criteria for visual impact assessments; \n 5.  Also notes  progress with implementing proposals associated with the "Heritage Protection White Paper" and its subsequent "Heritage Protection Bill"; \n 6.  Regrets  that the following issues still need to be addressed: \n a) buffer zone with adequate protection, \n b) specific skyline study of the property, its setting and views, to allow rapid in-depth assessments of the impact of development proposals in the immediate vicinity of the property, \n c) lack of clarity on the management system set out in the management plan for addressing conflicts between conservation and development, particularly in the setting of the property; \n 7.  Takes note  that the State Party has demonstrated its commitment to comply with the requests of the World Heritage Committee (Decision  31 COM 7B.91 ) to protect the property, its setting and related vistas. \n 8.  Requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2009,  a progress report on the above issues, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 33rd session in 2009.
