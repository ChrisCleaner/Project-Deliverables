VIII.12 A\xc3\xafr and T\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9 Natural Reserves (Niger)  \n The Committee was informed that the State Party had notified the Centre that it wished to complete implementation of all activities of the rehabilitation programme before requesting the Committee to consider removing this site from the List of World Heritage in Danger. A representative of the State Party who participated and presented a paper at the Amman Workshop confirmed this position of the State Party. \n The Committee invited the State Party to submit a comprehensive progress report, before 15 April 2001, to the Centre on the achievements of the rehabilitation programme implemented to date. It also requested the Centre and IUCN to review that report and submit their findings to the twenty-fifth ordinary session of the Bureau in 2001. The Centre and IUCN should undertake a detailed assessment of the threats to the site that have been effectively mitigated and determine the need for any additional actions that may be required to enable the twenty-fifth session of the Committee to decide whether or not this site could be removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger by the Committee at its twenty-fifth session at the end of 2001. The Committee retained this site in the List of World Heritage in Danger.
