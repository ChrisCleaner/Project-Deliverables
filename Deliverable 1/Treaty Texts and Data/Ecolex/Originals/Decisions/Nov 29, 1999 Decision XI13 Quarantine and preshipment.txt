The  Eleventh Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XI/13:      To note that, while the reliability of the survey data was noted by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to be insufficient to draw firm conclusions, the Panel\xe2\x80\x99s April 1999 report estimates that over 22 per cent of the methyl bromide use is excluded from control under the quarantine and pre-shipment exemption, and that this use is increasing in some countries;   To note that the Science Assessment Panel revised the ODP of methyl bromide to 0.4 in its 1998 report;   To note that, under an amendment adopted by the Eleventh Meeting of the Parties, each Party shall provide the Secretariat with statistical data on the annual amount of the controlled substance listed in Annex E used for quarantine and pre-shipment applications.   To request that the 2003 report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel:     Evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of alternative treatments and procedures that can replace methyl bromide for quarantine and pre-shipment;   Estimate the volume of methyl bromide that would be replaced by the implementation of technically and economically feasible alternatives for quarantine and pre-shipment, reported by commodity and/or application;     To request the Parties to review their national plant, animal, environmental, health and stored product regulations with a view to removing the requirement for the use of methyl bromide for quarantine and pre-shipment where technically and economically feasible alternatives exist;   To urge the Parties to implement procedures (using a form shown in the Panel\xe2\x80\x99s April 1999 report, if necessary) to monitor the uses of methyl bromide by commodity and quantity for quarantine and pre-shipment uses in order:     To target the efficient use of resources for undertaking research to develop and implement technically and economically feasible alternatives;   To encourage early identification of technically and economically feasible alternatives to methyl bromide for quarantine and pre-shipment where such alternatives exist;     To encourage the use of methyl bromide recovery and recycling technology (where technically and economically feasible) to reduce emissions of methyl bromide, until alternatives to methyl bromide for quarantine and pre-shipment uses are available.
