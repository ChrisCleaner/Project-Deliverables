After having taken note of the report of the Secretariat and information provided by the Observer of Spain, the Bureau thanked the national, regional and local authorities for the efforts undertaken and the results achieved in the conclusion of the matter concerning the new construction of the Rey Chico. The Bureau also commended the UNESCO Centre of Andalucia for the success of the seminar in revitalising the Albayzin and thanked those who contributed towards its convening and successful outcome. It finally thanked the Mayor&rsquo;s Office, the Junta of Andalusia and the religious and economic authorities for the work undertaken in the framework of the rehabilitation of the quarter, its encouragement of tourism and development of its artisans. However, the Bureau reminded the authorities of the need to apply the Convention and the Guidelines with regard to the management plan and the unicity of the site. Consequently, the Bureau forthwith requested the Spanish national authorities to establish without delay the Spain-UNESCO Scientific Committee and to convene it as soon as possible so that the measures necessary for the appropriate management of the site be identified and programmed.
