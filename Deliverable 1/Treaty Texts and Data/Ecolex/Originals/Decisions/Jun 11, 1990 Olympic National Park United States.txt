The Bureau noted with satisfaction that, as requested by the Committee at the time of the inscription of this site in 1981, the American authorities had completed amendments to the legislation and added a coastal strip and a number of offshore rocks and islands to the park. The Bureau commended the American authorities for their effective implementation of the recommendations of the Committee and requested that the extensions to the park be formally proposed for inclusion in the World Heritage List. The Bureau, however, noted with concern the negative impacts of the \'Nestucca Oil Spill\' which had occurred 90 km from the park\'s coastal zone and expressed the wish that the American authorities be prepared for similar events in the future with contingency plans to mitigate their negative impacts.
