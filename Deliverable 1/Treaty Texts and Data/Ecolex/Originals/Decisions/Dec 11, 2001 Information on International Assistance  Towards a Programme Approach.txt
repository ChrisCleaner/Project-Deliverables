XVII.8  The Secretariat provided the following justifications for the selection:&nbsp; \n \n  Tourism  - growing threats on World Heritage sites from tourism which, if sustainably managed could offer socio-economic development opportunities; \n  Forests  - since close to 60 of the natural sites on the World Heritage List are forests and that the lessons being learned from the large-scale UNESCO-UN Foundation projects in the tropical forest sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo can serve as case studies to enrich the programme; \n  Cities  - since close to 200 of the cultural sites on the List are historic centres or entire cities, and because 20% of the Fund\'s international assistance have served to address the challenge of urban heritage conservation; \n  Earthen structures  - since some 30 of the cultural sites on the List are included in this category, and due to the particularity of conservation of earthen heritage, and threats. \n \n  XVII.10  The Committee  expressed its appreciation  for the clarity of the presentation and the justifications provided.
