Property:  Golden   Mountains   of Altai  \n Id. N&deg;:  768 Rev.  \n State Party:  Russian Federation    \n Criteria:  N (iv)  \n The Altai region is an important and original centre of biodiversity of plant and animal species. It contains rare and endemic species, including the Snow Leopard. The Altai population of the Snow Leopard serves as a core source for the southern Siberian region. The site also displays the geological history of Asia, a variety of landscapes and ecosystems and contains excellent examples of glacial features. \n The Committee discussed whether to apply criterion (iii) and reviewed the situation of the management plans for the different clusters of the site. The Delegate of Thailand in referring to the Operational Guidelines, stated that the management plan should ideally be complete before the inscription of the site. \n The Committee decided to inscribe the site for its rich biodiversity and as the global centre of origin of montane flora of northern Asia under natural criterion (iv). \n The Committee urged the State Party to complete management plan for all of the three areas as soon as possible and suggested that other States Parties may wish to assist with this. It furthermore encouraged the State Party to start a co-operative process with neighbouring States Parties to consider a possible transboundary expansion. The Observer of the Russian Federation informed the Committee that his Government is continuing the efforts to complete all management plans. \n &nbsp;
