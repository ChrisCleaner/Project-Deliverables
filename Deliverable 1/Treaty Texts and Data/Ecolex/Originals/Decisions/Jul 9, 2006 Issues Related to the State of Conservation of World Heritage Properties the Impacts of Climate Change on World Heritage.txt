Further recalling  paragraph 44 of the  Operational Guidelines ,  5.  Thanks  the Government of the United Kingdom for having funded the meeting of experts, which took place on the 16th and 17th of March 2006 at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris, and  also thanks  the United Nations Foundation for its support, as well as all the experts who contributed to the meeting;  6.

Encourages  UNESCO, including the World Heritage Centre, and the Advisory Bodies to disseminate widely this strategy, the report, and any other related publications through appropriate means to the World Heritage community and the broader public;  8.  Requests  States Parties and all partners concerned to implement this strategy to protect the Outstanding Universal Value, integrity and authenticity of World Heritage sites from the adverse effects of Climate Change, to the extent possible and within the available resources, recognizing that there are other international instruments for coordinating the response to this challenge;  9.  Invites  States Parties, the World Heritage Centre and the Advisory Bodies to build on existing Conventions and programmes listed in Annex 4 of Document  WHC-06/30.COM/7.1 , in accordance with their mandates and as appropriate, in their implementation of Climate Change related activities;  10.  Also requests  States Parties, the World Heritage Centre, and the Advisory Bodies to seek ways to integrate, to the extent possible and within the available resources, this strategy into all the relevant processes of the  World Heritage Convention  including: nominations, reactive monitoring, periodic reporting, international assistance, capacity building, other training programmes, as well as with the &quot;Strategy for reducing risks from disasters at World Heritage properties&quot; ( WHC-06/30.COM/7.2 );  11.  Strongly encourages  the World Heritage Centre and the Advisory Bodies in collaboration with States Parties and other relevant partners to develop proposals for the implementation of pilot projects at specific World Heritage properties especially in developing countries, with a balance between natural and cultural properties as well as appropriate regional proposals, with the objective of developing best practices for implementing this Strategy including preventive actions, corrective actions and sharing knowledge, and  recommends  to the international donor community to support the implementation of such pilot projects;  12.  Further requests  the States Parties and the World Heritage Centre to work with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), with the objective of including a specific chapter on World Heritage in future IPCC assessment reports;  13.  Requests  the World Heritage Centre to prepare a policy document on the impacts of climate change on World Heritage properties involving consultations with relevant climate change experts and practitioners of heritage conservation and management, appropriate international organizations and civil society, to be discussed at the General Assembly of States Parties in 2007. A draft of the document should be presented to the 31st session in 2007 for comments.  This draft should include considerations on:   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0a) Synergies between conventions on this issue,  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0b) Identification of future research needs in this area,  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 c) Legal questions on the role of the  World Heritage\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Convention  with regard to suitable responses to Climate Change,  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 d) Linkages to other UN and international bodies dealing with the issues of climate change,  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 e) Alternative mechanisms, other than the List of World Heritage in Danger, to address concerns of international implication, such as climatic change ;  14.  Considers  that the decisions to include properties on the List of World Heritage in Danger because of threats resulting from climate change are to be made by the World Heritage Committee, on a case-by-case basis, in consultation and cooperation with States Parties, taking into account the input from Advisory Bodies and NGOs, and consistent with the  Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention .
