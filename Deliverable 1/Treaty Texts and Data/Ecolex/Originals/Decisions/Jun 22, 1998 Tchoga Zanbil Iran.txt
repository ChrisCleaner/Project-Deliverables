In view of the information provided by ICCROM and the Secretariat, the Bureau requested the Government of Iran to keep the Secretariat informed on the progress of the Japanese Trust Fund project for the conservation and management of Tchoga Zanbil, especially in relation to the urgently required measurement of the moisture content of the ziggurat of Tchoga Zanbil. This information will enable a structural analysis to be made for its appropriate conservation. The Observer of Iran thanked the Japanese authorities, UNESCO and ICCROM for their efforts to identify the problems at the site and their contribution to its protection. He also expressed the willingness of his Government to co-operate.
