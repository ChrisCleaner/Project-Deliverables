The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/2:     Aware  that Parties operating under Article 5 have been taking measures gradually to reduce and eventually eliminate their production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances in Annex A, group I (CFCs), and Annex B, group II (carbon tetrachloride),    Aware  also that Parties not operating under Article 5 have also been taking steps in advance of the Protocol control measures to reduce their production of those controlled substances that are exported to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5 Parties,    Recognizing  the need to ensure that the supply of Annex A, group I and Annex B, group II (carbon tetrachloride) ozone-depleting substances is sufficient to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5 Parties, while not being so abundant as to discourage efforts to phase out those substances in compliance with the Montreal Protocol,    Recognizing  also that comprehensive information on market trends related to Annex A, group I and Annex B, group II ozone-depleting substances would allow better planning by Article 5 Parties and ensure a more efficient and predictable phase-out of those substances,   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel:     To assess the quantities of controlled substances in Annex A, group I and Annex B, group II to the Montreal Protocol that are likely to be required by Parties operating under Article 5 of the Protocol for the period 2004-2010;   To assess the permitted levels of production from companies in Parties operating under Article 5 to the Protocol, taking into account schedules agreed for reduction in production under the Multilateral Fund;   To assess the quantities of controlled substances in Annex A, group I and Annex B, group II to the Protocol which can be produced and exported by Parties not operating under Article 5 in order to meet the basic domestic needs of Parties operating under Article 5 during the period 2004-2010, taking into account regional production phase-out regulations and agreements;   To also take into account, when preparing the assessments, the actual and potential impact of training programmes for refrigeration technicians, retrofitting, recovery and recycling operations and other measures in reducing the demand for Annex A, group I and Annex B, group II substances;   To report on bulk price ranges of Annex A, group I and Annex B, group II substances in a representative sample of Article 5 Parties, including relative changes in bulk prices from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003, in comparison to bulk prices of alternatives;   To present its report to the Open-ended Working Group at its twenty-fourth session or at the Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties.
