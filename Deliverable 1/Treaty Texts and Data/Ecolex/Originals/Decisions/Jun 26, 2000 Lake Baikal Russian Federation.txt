The Centre informed the Bureau that no information had been received from the State Party despite a number of letters written concerning the site. The Director of the UNESCO Office in Moscow attended the last session of the Baikal Commission and had noted that progress is very slow. \n IUCN fully supported the Baikal Law but highlighted concerns about the adequacy of its implementation, particularly in relation to discharge of waste into the Lake from the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mill. IUCN considered that there is a need to look for innovative mechanisms for dealing with this matter which must involve substantial investment in re-profiling the existing pulp and paper mill. IUCN also noted that a Greenpeace meeting would take place in July 2000 on the Baikal Law which may result in useful recommendations and actions. \n The Bureau expressed its concern that Federal Regulations related to the Baikal Law are not being effectively enforced and invited the State Party to take immediate steps to remedy this situation. The Bureau reiterated its request that the State Party provide an up-to-date report, by 15 September 2000 in particular focusing on issues raised by IUCN on the state of conservation of the site and that the report be submitted to the twenty-fourth extraordinary session of the Bureau.
