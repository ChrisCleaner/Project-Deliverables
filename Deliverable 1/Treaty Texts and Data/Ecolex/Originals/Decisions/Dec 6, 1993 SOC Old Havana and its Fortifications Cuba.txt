Old Havana and its Fortifications (Cuba)  \n In spite of a very well developed institutional structure, conservation efforts are seriously hindered under the present conditions in Cuba. A severe hurricaine struck Cuba in March 1993 causing serious damage to the site. Emergency assistance was underway for the restoration of the buildings surrounding the La Plaza Vieja. The monitoring mission recommended that World Heritage assistance be given to housing rehabilitation. The Committee commended the efforts of the State Party to safeguard the city and the important role on the national and regional level of the National Conservation Centre. \n &nbsp;
