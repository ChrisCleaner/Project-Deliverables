Florence   (Italy)  \n The Committee recalled that the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee at its seventeenth session in 1993 was informed of the severe damage caused by a car-bomb in the historical centre of Florence in May 1993. The Delegate of Italy informed the Committee of the actions the Government of Italy had taken after the bombing. He confirmed that the restoration works would be entirely concluded by mid-1995. An analysis of the damages to the historical structures and the art objects had provided important information on the effectiveness of certain protection measures and new instructions were to be issued to prevent the repetition of such events or to limit damage. \n &nbsp;
