Sinharaja     Forest   Reserve (Sri Lanka)  \n The Committee recalled that this site is protected as a National Wilderness Area and had been listed on the World Heritage List since 1988. There are many incremental threats to the site, but the Committee noted that a Management Plan to address these had been completed. It was further noted that continued monitoring of the site should be implemented as a priority activity of the Plan. \n The Committee noted the contribution of the Government of Norway of US$ 600,000 over a four-year period for the implementation of the Plan. The Committee asked the Centre to congratulate the administrators for their efforts in completing a Management Plan for the site and to urge them to give close attention to monitoring encroachments. \n &nbsp;
