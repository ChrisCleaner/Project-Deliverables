The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-10/34.COM/7B.Add, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  33 COM 7B.37 , adopted at its 33rd session (Seville, 2009), \n 3.  Commends  the State Party for its continued efforts in implementing the recommendations of the 2006 reactive monitoring mission; \n 4.  Notes with utmost concern  that deforestation is ongoing and appears to have increased considerably, mostly as a result of illegal logging and cattle ranching, and that intensive illegal commercial fisheries are taking place within the property, posing serious threats to the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n 5.  Requests  the State Party to strengthen its efforts to fully implement the 2006 reactive monitoring mission\'s recommendations, and in particular, recommendation (e) concerning effectively identifying and dealing with new intrusions into the property, and  considers  that further progress in addressing threats to the Rio Platano Reserve will require political recognition and support at the highest levels; \n 6.  Strongly urges  the State Party to systematically enforce existing nature conservation laws, and in particular anti-logging laws, as continued ineffective enforcement will lead to a degradation of the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n 7.  Also requests  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre/IUCN reactive monitoring mission in 2010 to assess the state of conservation of the property and progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2006 mission; \n 8.  Further requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2011 , a report on the state of conservation of the property, focusing on i) the implementation of the 2006 monitoring mission recommendations, ii) information regarding any plans for the construction of a hydroelectric dam that might affect the property, iii) the provision of a map unambiguously illustrating the boundaries of the property and iv) an in-depth analysis of the status of illegal logging, land tenure regulation and involvement of local communities, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 35th session in 2011.
