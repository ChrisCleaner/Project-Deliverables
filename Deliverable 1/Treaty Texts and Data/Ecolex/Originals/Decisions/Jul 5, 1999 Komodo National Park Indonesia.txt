Since the inscription of the site on the World Heritage List in 1991, the site has benefited from financial assistance from the Fund for the purchase of boats and for training staff in marine protected area management in Queensland, Australia. A monitoring report on the site was provided via the UNESCO Office, Jakarta, to the Centre in 1995. IUCN informed the Centre that it has received a report indicating an increase in illegal dynamite and cyanide fishing in coastal waters which has had a serious impact on large areas of coral in the northern half of the marine component of the Park. The Nature Conservancy has provided two speedboats for patrolling the coastal waters but destructive fishing techniques have had a major impact. Immigration to the islands is increasing bringing more pressure on fishery resources. \n The Bureau requested the State Party to consider inviting a monitoring mission to the site to assess the damage caused by destructive fishing practices and to jointly review management issues and identify priority measures needed to build management capacity and for international assistance. IUCN noted that funding should be provided for any additional monitoring missions foreseen by the Bureau.
