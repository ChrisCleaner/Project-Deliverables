II.1  The Committee adopted the agenda (WHC-99/CONF./209/1), the Annotated Agenda (WHC- 99/CONF.209/2) and the Provisional Calendar with modifications. Following unanimous agreement, the Committee decided to discuss the Agenda Item 7 on \'Follow-up to the work of the Consultative Body to the World Heritage Committee\', to enable a working group to be established under this agenda item and for it to complete its task as early as possible during the session. In response to the interventions by the Delegates of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Hungary, Thailand and Zimbabwe, the Chairperson proposed to hold discussions on Item 7 before agenda Item 10 which deals with the state of conservation of properties inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List, at the end of the afternoon session on Monday, 29 November, 1999. This was accepted and he then requested the Secretariat to redraft the timetable accordingly.
