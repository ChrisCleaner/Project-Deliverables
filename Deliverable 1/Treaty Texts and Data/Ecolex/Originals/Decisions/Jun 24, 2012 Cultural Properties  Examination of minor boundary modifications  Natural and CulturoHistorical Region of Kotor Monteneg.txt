The World Heritage Committee, \n &nbsp; \n \n  Having examined  Documents WHC-12/36.COM/8B.Add and WHC-12/36.COM/INF.8B1.Add, \n  Refers  the examination of the proposed minor modification to the boundary of the  Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor, Montenegro , back to the State Party in order to allow it to provide justification and detailed information on the proposed variations to the original 1979 property boundary; \n  Approves  the proposed buffer zone for the Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor, Montenegro; \n  Recommends  that the State Party establish as soon as possible a coordination of the Management Plan with the municipal urban planning documents to include controls applicable to development and infrastructure within the buffer zone. Such controls on development and infrastructure need to recognise the components necessary to the visual integrity of the property, including vistas and visual accents, horizontal and vertical relationships, materials and form of new construction, and must be integrated with the individual municipal plans in order to ensure the protection of the Outstanding Universal Value of the property.
