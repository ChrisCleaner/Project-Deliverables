Mosi-oa-Tunya/Victoria Falls (Zambia and Zimbabwe)  \n The World Heritage Centre was informed by letter of 5 August 1994 from the National Heritage Conservation commission of Zambia that the proposal to build the Batoka Dam was dropped. The Batoka Gorge Hydro Electric Scheme would have had a major environmental impact on the World Heritage site and would have flooded the Batoka Gorge of the Zambezi River, a two million year old unique geological and geomorphological formation. \n The Committee commended the Government of Zambia on the decisions taken to ensure the integrity of this World Heritage site. \n &nbsp;
