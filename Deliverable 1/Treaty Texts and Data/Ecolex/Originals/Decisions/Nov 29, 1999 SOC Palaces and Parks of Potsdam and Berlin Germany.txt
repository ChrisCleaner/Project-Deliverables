X.37 Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin (Germany)  \n The Committee recalled the report from the twenty-third extraordinary session of the Bureau on the state of conservation of this property and adopted the following decision: \n "The Committee commended the German authorities for their fifth report on the state of conservation of the Parks and Palaces of Potsdam and Berlin. It acknowledged the efforts made to restrict as much as possible the negative effects of the Havel project (German Unity Project 17) on the integrity of the World Heritage site. Nevertheless, it considered that considerable threats persist to the landscape and certain historic monuments, such as the Sacrow Church and the Babelsberg Engine House. \n The Committee wished to know whether it would be possible to restrict passage through the World Heritage site to standard-sized vessels and to develop the Havel Canal, which lies outside the site (the northern route) so as to permit the passage of larger vessels. \n It requested the German authorities to continue its efforts to find a solution in conformity with the requirements of the World Heritage Convention. A report should be provided before 15 April 2000 in order that it may be examined by the Bureau at its twenty-fourth session."
