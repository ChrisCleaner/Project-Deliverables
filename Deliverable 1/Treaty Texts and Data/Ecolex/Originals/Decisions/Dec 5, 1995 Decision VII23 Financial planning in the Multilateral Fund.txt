The  Seventh Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. VII/23:      To note with appreciation the report and the outline and framework for a three-year rolling business plan prepared by the Executive Committee;   To request the Executive Committee to provide to the Parties at their Eighth Meeting a full three-year rolling business plan based on the outline and framework approved by the Parties at their Seventh Meeting;   To note that the three-year rolling business plan must reflect the purpose of the Multilateral Fund, which is to enable Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 to meet their Protocol obligations. The plan would be based on the level of replenishment decided by the Parties and should be used as a basis for projecting beyond the period of the current replenishment. The plan should be based on,  inter alia , the intersectoral priorities and strategies contained in the country programmes and should be consistent with agreed commitments under the Montreal Protocol.
