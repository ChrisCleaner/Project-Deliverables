The Standing Committee should review any proposals from the Secretariat to correct non-substantive errors or minor editorial faults in current Resolutions and Decisions and decide whether they should be referred to the Conference of the Parties. In cases where the Committee agrees with the proposals and considers that they need not be referred to the Conference, it may instruct the Secretariat to republish the Resolutions and Decisions with the necessary corrections.
