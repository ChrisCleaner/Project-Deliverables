The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/43:      To note that Uganda ratified the Montreal Protocol on 15 September 1988, the London Amendment on 20 January 1994, the Copenhagen Amendment on 22 November 1999 and the Montreal Amendment on 23 November 1999. Uganda is classified as a Party operating under Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee in 1994. Since approval of the country programme, the Executive Committee has approved $547,896 from the Multilateral Fund to enable compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;   To note also that Uganda\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for Annex A, group I substances is 12.8 ODP-tonnes. It has failed to report data for either of the control periods 1 July 2000-30 June 2001 and 1 July 2001-31 December 2002, and has reported annual data for 2001 which is above its baseline. In the absence of further clarification, Uganda is presumed to be in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2A of the Montreal Protocol;   To urge Uganda, accordingly, to report data for the control periods from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 and 1 July 2001 to 31 December 2002, as a matter of urgency;   To note further that Uganda has presented sufficient information to justify its request for a change in its baseline consumption of the controlled substance in Annex E from 1.9 ODP-tonnes to 6.3 ODP-tonnes, and that that change is therefore approved;   To note that Uganda presented its request for a baseline change before the Implementation Committee had been able to recommend a standard methodology for the presentation of requests for such changes, and that all future requests should follow the methodology described in decision XV/19;   To note, however, that Uganda reported consumption of 30 ODP-tonnes for the controlled substance in Annex E in 2002. As a consequence, for 2002, even after the revision in its baseline, Uganda was in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2H of the Montreal Protocol;   To note with appreciation Uganda\xe2\x80\x99s submission of its plan of action to ensure a prompt return to compliance with the control measures for the controlled substance in Annex E, and to note further that, under the plan, without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Montreal Protocol, Uganda specifically commits itself:     To reducing methyl bromide consumption from 30 ODP-tonnes in 2002 as follows:     To 24 ODP-tonnes in 2003 and in 2004;   To 6 ODP-tonnes in 2005;   To 4.8 ODP-tonnes in 2006;   To phasing out methyl bromide consumption by 1 January 2007, as provided in the plan for reduction and phase-out of methyl bromide consumption, save for critical uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To monitoring its system for licensing imports and exports of ODS introduced in 1998, which will be modified by the inclusion of quotas in the first quarter of 2004;   To introducing a ban on imports of ODS-using equipment in the first quarter of 2004;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 7 above should enable Uganda to return to compliance by 2007, and to urge Uganda to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase out consumption of the controlled substance in Annex E;   To monitor closely the progress of Uganda with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of CFCs and methyl bromide. To the degree that Uganda is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Uganda should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Uganda, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of CFCs and methyl bromide (that is, the subjects of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
