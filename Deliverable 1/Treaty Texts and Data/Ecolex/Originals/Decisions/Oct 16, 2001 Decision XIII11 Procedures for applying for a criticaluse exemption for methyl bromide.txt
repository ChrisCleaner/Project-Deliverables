The  Thirteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XIII/11:    Noting that Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 must cease production and consumption of methyl bromide for other than quarantine and pre-shipment applications from 1 January 2005, except for consumption and production that meet the levels agreed by the Parties for critical uses,    Noting  the importance of providing the Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 with early guidance on arrangements for implementing decision IX/6, which provides criteria and procedures for assessing a critical methyl bromide use,    Noting  the need for the Parties to have adequate guidance to enable them to submit nominations for critical-use exemptions for consideration at the 15th Meeting of the Parties in 2003,     To note with appreciation the work of the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee (MBTOC) in presenting the information required in order adequately to assess nominations submitted in pursuance of decision IX/6 for critical-use exemptions and the ongoing work of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel in preparing a consolidated list of alternatives to methyl bromide that had been included in past TEAP and MBTOC reports;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to prepare a handbook on critical-use nomination procedures which provides this information, and the schedule for submission which reflects that currently employed in the essential-use nomination procedure;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to finalize the consolidated list of alternatives to methyl bromide referred to in paragraph 1 and post it on its Website as soon as possible;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to finalize the \xe2\x80\x9cHandbook on Critical Use Nominations for Methyl Bromide\xe2\x80\x9d by January 2002, and the Secretariat to post this Handbook on its Website as soon as possible;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to engage suitably qualified agricultural economists to assist it in reviewing critical-use nominations.
