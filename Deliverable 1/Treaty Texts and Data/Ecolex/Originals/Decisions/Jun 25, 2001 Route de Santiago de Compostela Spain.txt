V.280&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau noted and endorsed the opinion expressed by ICOMOS that the proposed increase of the dam and water level of a barrage in the regions of Aragon and Navarra (the  Embalse de Yesa)  would seriously affect the values of the Route of Santiago in the area concerned, as well as the values of several related historical monuments. The Bureau requested ICOMOS to continue its dialogue with the Spanish authorities to assess the impact of the enlargement of the barrage and to discuss if proposed mitigation measures (such as the relocation of monuments or the relocation of the pathways of the Route of Santiago) could be accepted. It requested ICOMOS and the Spanish authorities to report on the results of these consultations by 15 September 2001 for examination by the Bureau at its twenty-fifth extraordinary session.
