X.13 Yellowstone National Park (United States of America)  \n The Committee recalled that at its last session it had requested the State Party to submit an up-to-date state of conservation report on the site. This should include proposed measures being taken by the State Party to determine impacts of rehabilitation measures on the integrity of the site and plans for the eventual removal of the site from the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Observer of the United States of America regretted the delay in the submission of the report requested by the last session of the Committee but informed the Committee that the report was expected to be received during the week of the Committee\'s deliberations. He said that the delay was partly due to the State Party\'s efforts to provide a detailed analysis of the impact of mitigation measures and derive a process and a plan for the possible removal of the site from the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Observer, however, informed the Committee that his Government was of the view that although most threats to the integrity of the site were being effectively mitigated, at present the site needs to be retained in the List of World Heritage in Danger pending the review of the report requested by the Committee. \n The Committee decided to retain the site in the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Committee invited the State Party to submit the report to the Centre as soon as possible and IUCN to undertake a thorough review of the report and submit its findings and recommendations to the twenty-fourth ordinary session of the Bureau in mid-2000. The Committee noted that the State Party provided the reports on Yellowstone and Everglades National Parks on 1 December 1999 to the World Heritage Centre. \n &nbsp;
