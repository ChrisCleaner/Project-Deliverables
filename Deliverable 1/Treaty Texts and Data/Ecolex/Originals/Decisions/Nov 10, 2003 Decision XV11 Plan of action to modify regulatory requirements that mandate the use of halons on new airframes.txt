The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/11:     Acknowledging  that potential alternatives to the use of halons exist to provide the necessary fire protection for both engine nacelles and cargo bays of commercial aircraft,    Concerned  to note that new airframes are still being designed and certified with halons as the required fire extinguishant owing to regulatory requirements,    Acknowledging  that airframe certification agencies and airframe manufacturers will wish to participate in a joint effort to allow the certification of alternatives to halon on new airframes,   To authorize representatives of the Ozone Secretariat and the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to engage in discussions with the relevant International Civil Aviation Organization bodies in the development of a timely plan of action to enable consideration of the possibility that modifying the regulatory requirements that mandate the use of halons on new airframes may be feasible without compromising the health and safety of airline passengers, and to report thereon to the sixteenth Meeting of the Parties.
