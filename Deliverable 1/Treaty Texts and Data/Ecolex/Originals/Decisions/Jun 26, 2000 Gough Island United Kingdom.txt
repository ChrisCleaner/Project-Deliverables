IUCN noted that it had received reports indicating that the Reserve boundaries have been extended to 12 nautical miles of territorial waters thus now matching the area of the World Heritage site. IUCN commented that the threat to the site posed by the invasive species  Sagina , is being addressed through an eradication programme. \n The Observer of the United Kingdom informed the Bureau that, to the best of his knowledge, the boundaries have not been officially confirmed as a formal legal process must be followed for this purpose.&nbsp; Concerning the invasive species, the eradication programme has been successfully completed. \n The Bureau requested that the State Party and the St. Helena Government confirm the information reported by IUCN. Furthermore, the Bureau invited the State Party to now consider extension of the World Heritage boundary and to report on what it can do to protect the wider marine environment.
