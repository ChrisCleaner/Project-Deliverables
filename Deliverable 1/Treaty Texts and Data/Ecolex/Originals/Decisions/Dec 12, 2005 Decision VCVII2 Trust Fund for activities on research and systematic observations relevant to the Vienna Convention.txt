The  Conference of the Parties , in  Decision VCVII/2 of its Seventh Meeting , decided:    Noting  the conclusions and recommendations of the sixth meeting of Ozone Research Managers regarding the continuing need to ensure a stable, long-term observational capability that is regionally balanced in order to track the evolution of ozone and climate-related source gases and parameters, detect and track the stabilization and expected recovery of stratospheric ozone, attribute changes in radiative forcing to changes in the ozone profile and derive a global record of ground-level ultraviolet radiation,     Noting  the current need to enhance the capacity of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol and countries with economies in transition, in order to enable them to maintain existing instruments and networks, install new capabilities to provide useful enhancements to observational capabilities and disseminate information about the effects of ozone and ultraviolet changes,     Noting  that such enhancements in capacity are in the interests of all Parties, since the creation of a more informed scientific community will not only contribute to global ozone and ultraviolet radiation science, but will serve as the basis for providing local policy makers with further scientific support for the long-term implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments,      To take note, with appreciation, of the report of the sixth meeting of the Ozone Research Mangers and the recommendations contained therein;    To request the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, through the Ozone Secretariat, to extend the Trust Fund established pursuant to decision VI/2 of the Vienna Convention beyond 31 December 2007 for an additional eight years up to 31 December 2015 in order to continue to support monitoring and research activities in developing countries and countries with economies in transition;    To take a decision at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 2014 on whether or not to extend the Trust Fund beyond 2015;    To request the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization to continue their cooperation with respect to the Trust Fund pursuant to the terms of the agreement contained in annex I to the note on issues for discussion by and information for the attention of the Conference of the Parties and the Meeting of the Parties, 2  on the understanding that that agreement may be changed from time to time to meet evolving needs and conditions;    To urge all Parties and international organizations to make voluntary contributions to the Fund as well as voluntary contributions in kind for the priorities mentioned in the recommendations of the sixth Meeting of the Ozone Research Managers;    To request the Secretariat to invite the Parties and relevant international organizations to make annual voluntary contributions to the Fund, and with each successive invitation to the Parties, to report on the prior years\' contributions, funded activities, and future planned activities;    To request the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization to direct funds received to priorities among those listed within the recommendations of the sixth Meeting of the Ozone Research Managers striving for regional balance, on the understanding that, depending on available funding, an effort should be made to leverage other sources of funding, especially similar funds within the World Meteorological Organization, and provide assistance to a number of Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol and countries with economies in transition in all regions;    To request the Ozone Secretariat to report to the next meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Vienna Convention in 2008 on the operation of, contributions to, and expenditures from the Trust Fund since its inception.
