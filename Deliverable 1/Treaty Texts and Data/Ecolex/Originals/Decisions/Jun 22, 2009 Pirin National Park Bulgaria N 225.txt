The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-09/33.COM/7B , \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  31 COM 7B.27 , adopted at its 31st session (Christchurch, 2007), \n 3.  Also recalling  that the Outstanding Universal Value of the property has been repeatedly and significantly impacted by the development of ski facilities and extension of tourism zones, to the extent that the property may be considered for inscription on the List of World Heritage in Danger, \n 4.  Notes  that the State Party has resubmitted a proposed extension for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010; \n 5.  Considers  that continued ski development is a critical threat to the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n 6.  Strongly urges  the State Party to ensure that no further development of ski facilities or extension of the tourism zones takes place within the property, and to ensure all necessary steps to provide for rigorous enforcement of protection and planning requirements within Pirin National Park, and in relation to developments outside its boundaries that could affect it; \n 7.  Requests  IUCN, in carrying out its evaluation of the proposed extension of the property, to also consider the state of conservation of the existing property, and to review and advise whether its Outstanding Universal Value, has been negatively affected by the recent developments; \n 8.  Also requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2010 , a report on the state of conservation of the property, with particular reference to its effective protection from inappropriate development and human use within and beyond its boundaries, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010,  with a view to considering, in the absence of substantial progress, the possible inscription of the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
