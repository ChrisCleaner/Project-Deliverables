During its present session, the Secretariat informed the Bureau that this site, inscribed in 1978, continued to be threatened by frequent floods. However, thanks to financial assistance from the European Union, the Polish authorities have at their disposal the necessary pumping material to maintain a satisfactory level of salubrity of the historic part of the mine. \n Furthermore, Bureau members were informed that in 1991 the Polish authorities prepared a humidity-level study, and that in 1993 the data collected was examined during a seminar held in the United States, which was attended by two Polish experts, thanks to assistance from the World Heritage Fund. The seminar drew up recommendations for the long-term conservation strategy of the mine. \n This strategy includes a project for ventilation and dehumidification for which the purchase of equipment amounting to US$ 156,000 is necessary. In the coming months, the Polish authorities may present a request for technical cooperation from the World Heritage Fund for partial financial support for the purchase of this equipment. \n The Bureau took note of this information with satisfaction, and the World Heritage Centre will be kept informed of the different stages of this project.
