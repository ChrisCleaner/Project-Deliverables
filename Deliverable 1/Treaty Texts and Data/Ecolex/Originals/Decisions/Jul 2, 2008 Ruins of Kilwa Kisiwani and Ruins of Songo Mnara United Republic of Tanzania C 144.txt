Acknowledges  receipt of a Statement of significance and a Statement of authenticity/ integrity, but  regrets  that these are not in conformity with the Statement of Outstanding Universal Value, including the conditions of authenticity and integrity, as outlined in the  Operational Guidelines ; \n 5.  Notes with concern  that the report does not provide detailed and explicit information on the progress made on delineating boundaries for the two components of the property and their buffer zones;  requests  the State Party to undertake this exercise as a matter of urgency and  encourages  the State Party to submit, if necessary a request for International Assistance for this purpose; \n 6.

Requests  partners to continue to assist the State Party financially and technically to address these challenges; \n 9.  Reiterates its request  to the State party to use the management plan as the main vehicle for managing the site and for ensuring co-ordination of all activities affecting the property; \n 10.  Adopts  the following as the Desired state of conservation for the property in view of its future removal from the List of World Heritage in Danger: \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) at least 70% rehabilitation of the heritage monuments; \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) surveyed and demarcated boundaries as well as the extension of the property to include Kilwa Kivinje and Sanje ya Kati; \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) established proper land-use plan; \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) demonstrate progress in the implementation of the management and the conservation plan; \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) fully established on-site administrative structures; \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; f) halted sea-wave action; \n 11.

Invites  the State Party to consider an extension of the property to include Kilwa Kivinje and Sanje ya Kati and  recommends  that the State Party submit this extension with the delineation of the boundaries for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 35th session in 2011; \n 13.  Also requests  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre / ICOMOS Reactive Monitoring mission to assist the State Party in developing the previously requested Statement of Outstanding Universal Value, including the conditions of integrity and authenticity, and in exploring how to ensure that the site\'s management plan can function as the key, central co-ordinating mechanism in managing the property, and finally to assess the progress made in improving the state of conservation of the property; \n 14.  Further requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2009,  a report on the state of conservation of the property, including the progress in implementing the corrective measures, and the re-evaluation of the timeframe for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 33rd session in 2009; \n 15.
