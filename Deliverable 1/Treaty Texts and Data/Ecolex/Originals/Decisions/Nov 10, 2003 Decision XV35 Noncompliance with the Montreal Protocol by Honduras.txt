The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/35:      To note that Honduras ratified the Montreal Protocol on 14 October 1993 and the London and Copenhagen Amendments on 24 January 2002. Honduras is classified as a Party operating under Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee in 1996. Since approval of the country programme, the Executive Committee has approved $2,912,410 from the Multilateral Fund to enable compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;   To note also that Honduras\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for the controlled substance in Annex E is 259.43 ODP-tonnes. It reported consumption of 412.52 ODP-tonnes of the controlled substance in Annex E in 2002. As a consequence, for 2002 Honduras was in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2H of the Montreal Protocol;   To recognize the devastation and disruption to agriculture caused by Hurricane Mitch in October 1998, which contributed to the increase in use of methyl bromide, and to applaud Honduras\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to recover from the situation;   To note with appreciation Honduras\xe2\x80\x99s submission of its plan of action to ensure a prompt return to compliance with the control measures for the controlled substance in Annex E, and to note further that, under the plan, Honduras specifically commits itself:     To reducing methyl bromide consumption from 412.52 ODP-tonnes in 2002 as follows:     To 370.0 ODP-tonnes in 2003;   To 306.1 ODP-tonnes in 2004;   To 207.5 ODP-tonnes in 2005;     To monitoring its system for licensing imports and exports of ODS, including quotas, in force since May 2003;   To monitoring its ban on imports of ODS-using equipment, in force since May 2003;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 4 above should enable Honduras to return to compliance by 2005, and to urge Honduras to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase out consumption of the ozone-depleting substance in Annex E;   To monitor closely the progress of Honduras with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of methyl bromide. To the degree that Honduras is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Honduras should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Honduras, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of methyl bromide (that is, the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
