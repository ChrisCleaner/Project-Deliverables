VII.31 Wieliczka Salt Mines (Poland)  \n The Committee took note of the information provided by the Secretariat that UNESCO had taken all the necessary measures for the implementation of the technical cooperation project that was approved by the World Heritage Committee at its eighteenth session but that it had not received to date the consent of the Polish authorities as to UNESCO\'s proposals regarding the purchase of the equipment. In the absence of any further clarification from the State Party concerned, the Delegate of the United States of America informed the Committee that the Polish authorities had just recently communicated to his country that they had received additional funds from the Marie Curie Fund and that the purchase of the equipment would soon be forthcoming. The Committee thereupon requested the Secretariat to take the necessary measures for the prompt implementation of the assistance and to keep the committee informed of its results. The Committee decided to retain the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger until the results and a report of the impact of the equipment on the conditions of the site are known. \n &nbsp;
