Inscribes  the  Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture, Portugal,  on the World Heritage List as a cultural landscape on the basis of cultural criteria (iii) and (v):    Criteria (iii) and (v):  The Pico Island landscape reflects a unique response to viniculture on a small volcanic island and one that has been evolving since the arrival of the first settlers in the 15th century. The extraordinarily beautiful humanmade landscape of small, stone walled fields is testimony to generations of smallscale farmers who, in a hostile environment, created a sustainable living and much-prized wine.
