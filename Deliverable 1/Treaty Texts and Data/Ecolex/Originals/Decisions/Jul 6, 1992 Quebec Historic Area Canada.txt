The Bureau was informed of the building proposals in the buffer zone along the Saint-Lawrence River and the impact they would have on the views to and from the River. ICOMOS was critical about the consultation process and the design and specifically of the failure of the many levels of government to work together. The Bureau also learnt that four other prominent persons in Quebec had expressed similar concerns. The Bureau noted with concern the incompatibility between such activities and the aspiration of Quebec City concerning  the  World Heritage Cities Secretariat. The creation of an interdepartmental committee to coordinate federal government inputs to the issue was considered useful. The Bureau requested the Chairman to write to the three concerned levels of  the  Canadian government (municipal, provincial and federal) expressing its concerns and requested that ICOMOS and the World Heritage Centre obtain a detailed report on the status of the building proposals for submission to the Committee in December 1992.
