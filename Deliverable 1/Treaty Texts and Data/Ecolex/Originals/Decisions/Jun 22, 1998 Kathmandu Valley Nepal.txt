The Bureau expressed concern over the continued demolition of traditional buildings of architectural value and illegal new development within the Kathmandu Valley World Heritage site, despite the building control efforts made by His Majesty\'s Government of Nepal and the concerned local authorities. It requested that the Report of the Joint UNESCO/ICOMOS/Government of Nepal Mission be submitted to its members well in advance of the twenty-second extraordinary session of the Bureau to enable a careful examination of the progress made in building control and the programme of corrective measures. On the basis of this examination, the Bureau will then formulate a conclusive recommendation to enable the Committee to decide whether or not to inscribe this site on the List of World Heritage in Danger. It will also consider actions it may wish to take in regard to the programme of corrective measures, as well as on the pending nomination submitted by the State Party to inscribe Kokhana as an additional Monument Zone of the site.
