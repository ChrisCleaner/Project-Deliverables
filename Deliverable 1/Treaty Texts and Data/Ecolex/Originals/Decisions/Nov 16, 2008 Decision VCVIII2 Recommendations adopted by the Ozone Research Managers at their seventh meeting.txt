Recalling  that, pursuant to the objective defined in decision I/6 of the Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention, the Ozone Research Managers review ongoing national and international research and monitoring programmes with a view to ensuring the proper coordination of those programmes and identifying gaps that need to be addressed,   Recognizing  that the Ozone Research Managers at their seventh meeting emphasized the discussion of satellite research and monitoring owing to concerns among scientists that there could be serious gaps in satellite monitoring and associated data when current generation satellites and associated instruments reach the end of their useful lives in the next few years,   Also recognizing  that the Ozone Research Managers have noted that international funding and cooperation are essential for the implementation of the their recommendations, that their previous recommendations have not received sufficient attention owing to a lack of such funding and cooperation and that problems associated with the maintenance of existing instruments and networks for ozone monitoring and the development of new capabilities have been exacerbated as a result,   Emphasizing  the need for continued monitoring of the effectiveness of the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and its adjustments and amendments, including the adjustment providing for the accelerated phase-out of hydrochloroflurocarbons, the impact of the increasing abundance in the atmosphere of many substitute chemicals, including hydrofluorocarbons, and the expected recovery of the ozone layer in a context of climate change,    To take note with appreciation of the report of the seventh meeting of the Ozone Research Managers;    To endorse the recommendations adopted by the Ozone Research Managers at their seventh meeting, as set out in the report of that meeting;   To urge space agencies and Governments to ensure the continuation of satellite research and observations, particularly to allow for measurements that contribute to the long\xe2\x80\x91term time series for both total and profile ozone and profiles of ozone-related and climate\xe2\x80\x91related species and parameters, and to carry out any necessary gap\xe2\x80\x91filler missions in order to avoid gaps in areas of atmospheric observation that are critical to understanding and monitoring changes in atmospheric ozone and surface ultraviolet radiation and their interrelationship with climate variability and change;   To request all Parties to make a renewed effort to implement the actions recommended by the Ozone Research Managers, particularly those adopted at their seventh meeting, with a view to:       (a) Addressing uncertainties and new questions, including actual quantification of the extent to which chemical and dynamical processes are responsible for ozone production, loss, transport and distribution as well as changes in surface ultraviolet radiation resulting from changes in ozone and other atmospheric parameters and their impact on human and biological systems;    (b) Maintaining and expanding surface observation networks where gaps in geographical coverage result in data deficiencies in order to ensure the continuity and improvement of ground\xe2\x80\x91based in situ observations of ozone depleting substances, their substitutes and greenhouse gases as well as the networks that provide altitude profile information for ozone\xe2\x80\x91related and climate\xe2\x80\x91related species;    (c) Ensuring that data acquired through observation are of the highest possible quality and include the metadata necessary to make them valuable to users today and in the future and, to that end, that efforts are made to enhance data archiving, including through the development of appropriate data quality assurance and submission procedures and timely access by users;    (d) Strengthening the capacity of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to enable them to maintain existing instruments and networks, acquire new observational capabilities and increase their participation in scientific research and assessments;
