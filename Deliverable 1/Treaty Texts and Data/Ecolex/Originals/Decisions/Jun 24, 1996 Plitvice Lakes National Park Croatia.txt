Following an endorsement by the last session of the World Heritage Committee, a multinational rapid assessment mission was organized by the Centre and the Croatian authorities from 5 to 9 May 1996. The mission reviewed the state of conservation of the site, identified impact and damages caused by armed conflict to park facilities infrastructure, reviewed the legislative, administrative and management frameworks, assessed the socioeconomic situation of the site with regard to tourism potential and proposed summary recommendations. The full report of the mission was presented to the Bureau as Information Document WHC-96/CONF.202/INF.13. The Bureau took note of the report and the specific recommendation made concerning the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n The Bureau commended the Croatian authorities for their initial rehabilitation activities and recommended to the Committee to maintain the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger because, although there was no longer threat of armed conflict to World Heritage values, there were potential and ascertained threats such as visitor impacts, water contamination and other conditions identified in the mission report.
