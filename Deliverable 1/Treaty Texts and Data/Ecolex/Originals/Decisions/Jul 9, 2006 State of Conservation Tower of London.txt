The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-06/30.COM/7B,   2.  Recalling  Decision  29 COM 7B.89 , adopted at its 29th session (Durban, 2005),  3.  Notes with great concern  that proposed new developments around the Tower of London and Westminster Palace, Westminster Abbey and Saint Margaret\'s Church World Heritage properties, appear not to respect the significance of either World Heritage property, their settings and related vistas;  4.  Regrets  that the London Plan policies to protect the World Heritage property and its environment do not seem to be applied effectively, that statutory protection for views to and from the Tower could be diminished, and that the management plan has still not been finalised;  5.  Also regrets  that the requested in-depth study on the possible impact of development projects in the immediate vicinity of the World Heritage property has not been submitted and that no detailed skyline study of the Tower, its setting and views has yet been carried out and  urges  the State Party to carry out such a skyline survey as soon as possible to provide a qualitative framework for assessing the impact of new development on views and setting that contribute to the outstanding universal value of the Tower;  6.  Requests  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre/ICOMOS monitoring mission as soon as possible to assess the impact of current planning proposals in the spirit of the Vienna Memorandum on "World Heritage and Contemporary Architecture, Managing the Historic Urban Landscape" (2005) and  to review the possibility of inclusion of the property in the List of World Heritage in Danger , including benchmarks and timeframes for corrective action;  7.  Also requests  the State Party to provide the World Heritage Centre with an updated report, by  1 February 2007  on the progress of its undertakings in this area, and on the state of conservation of the property, for examination by the Committee at its 31st session in 2007.
