The Algerian representative suggested that the Bureau and the Committee should re-examine the voting procedure for the General Assembly of States Parties. \n 43. The Committee agreed that there was a need to ensure an equitable representation of the different regions and cultures of the world, as is stated in Article 8, paragraph 1 of the Convention. It requested the Secretariat to present the Bureau and the Committee with proposals which would respond to this need and which could eventually be adopted by the 7th General Assembly of States Parties in 1989. \n &nbsp;
