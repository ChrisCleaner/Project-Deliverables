The  Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVII/35:      To recall decision XIII/19, which noted that Kazakhstan was in non-compliance from 1998 to 2000 with its obligations under Article 2A of the Montreal Protocol to maintain total phase-out of its consumption of the controlled substances in Annex A, group I (CFCs), but also noted with appreciation the plan of action submitted by Kazakhstan to ensure its prompt return to compliance;   To note with concern, however, that Kazakhstan reported annual consumption for the controlled substances in Annex A, group I (CFCs), in 2004 of 11.2 ODP-tonnes, which is inconsistent with the Party\xe2\x80\x99s commitment contained in decision XIII/19 to reduce its consumption of the controlled substances in Annex A, group I (CFCs), to zero in 2004;   To note further with concern that Kazakhstan has not submitted to the Implementation Committee the requested explanation for this deviation and strongly to urge the Party to submit this information, along with its ozone-depleting substance data report for 2005, and to report on its commitment, also contained in decision XIII/19, to implement a ban on the import of equipment using ozone-depleting-substances, as a matter of urgency, in time for consideration by the Committee at its next meeting;   To remind the Party of paragraph 4 of decision XIII/19, which records the agreement of the Thirteenth Meeting of the Parties to monitor the progress of Kazakhstan with regard to the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances, particularly towards meeting the specific commitments contained in decision XIII/19. In this regard, the Parties requested that Kazakhstan should submit a complete copy of its country programme and subsequent updates, if any, to the Ozone Secretariat. To the degree that Kazakhstan is working towards and meeting the specific time-based commitments contained in decision XIII/19 and continues to report data annually demonstrating a decrease in imports and consumption, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In this regard, Kazakhstan should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet these commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that might be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through decision XIII/19, however, the Parties cautioned Kazakhstan, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that the country fails to meet the commitments noted above in the times specified, the Parties should consider measures, consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. These measures could include the possibility of actions that may be available under Article 4 designed to ensure that the supply of controlled substances in Annex A and Annex B that are the subject of non-compliance is ceased, and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
