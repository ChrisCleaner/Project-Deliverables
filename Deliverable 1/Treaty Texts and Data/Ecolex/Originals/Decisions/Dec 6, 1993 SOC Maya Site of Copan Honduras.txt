Maya Site of Copan (Honduras)  \n Studies and works in Copan are generally conducted according to high scientific standards. Special attention should be paid to the conservation of stone and stuccos. The original sculptures will be placed in a site museum and the replicas on the original sites. It is recommended to redefine the boundaries of the "Copan Archaeological Park" and to prepare an extension of the site. Furthermore, the management plan for the site should be updated. \n &nbsp;
