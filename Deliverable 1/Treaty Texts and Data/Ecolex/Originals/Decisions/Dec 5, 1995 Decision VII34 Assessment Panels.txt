The  Seventh Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. VII/34:      To note with appreciation the work done by the Scientific, Environmental Effects, and Technology and Economic Assessment Panels and the Technical Options Committees and Working Groups in preparing their reports of November 1994, March 1995 and November 1995;   To request the three Assessment Panels to update their reports of November 1994 and submit them to the Secretariat by 31 October 1998 for consideration by the Open-ended Working Group and by the Eleventh Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in 1999;   That the Scientific Assessment Panel should keep the Parties to the Montreal Protocol informed of any important new scientific developments on a year-to-year basis. The major emphasis of the 1998 assessment should be twofold:     An evaluation of the updated understanding of the impact of halocarbons on the ozone layer, including: observed and expected trends in controlled substances, ozone, and ultraviolet radiation; an improved understanding of the ozone-depleting role of methyl bromide; consequences to the ozone layer of non-compliance with the Montreal Protocol; a continuing evaluation of the ozone-depleting potentials of the substitutes for the phased-out substances; and the prediction of future halogen atmospheric abundances and ozone levels; and   An assessment of other aspects of ozone changes, such as the impacts of aircraft emissions, and the role of ozone changes in the alteration of the global climate system, with particular attention to the need for adequate information in the southern hemisphere. The Panel is requested to work as appropriate with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change;     That the Environmental Effects Panel should keep the Parties to the Montreal Protocol informed on any important new scientific developments on a year-to-year basis. It should consider:     In consultation with the Scientific Assessment Panel, observed and predicted changes in ultraviolet radiation;   Environmental effects of changing ultraviolet radiation; and   Direct environmental effects of chemicals involved in the problem of depletion of the ozone layer;     That the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel should keep the Parties to the Montreal Protocol informed of any important new technical and economic developments on a year-to-year basis. It should furthermore:     Complete by 31 March of each year the evaluation of essential-use nominations submitted for 1997 and beyond;   With regard to metered-dose inhalers:     Recommend an accounting framework for reporting quantities and uses of ozone-depleting substances produced and consumed for metered-dose inhalers under terms of essential-use exemptions;   Report progress in commercial availability and acceptance of emerging non-ODS alternatives and substitutes;   Describe educational and training approaches to speed and the successful transition to non-ODS therapy, mindful of the needs of patients and the special circumstances of Parties operating under Article 5 and countries with economies in transition; and   By 31 March 1996, consider options for a transitional strategy for metered-dose inhalers, taking into consideration the rate of commercialization, manufacturing rationalization, the progress on national approval, the special circumstances of Parties operating under Article 5 and countries with economies in transition, and the importance of drug access by patients, including those who face particularly challenging therapy;     Report progress and developments in the control of substances by 31 March of each year;   Update or supplement its report on the status of implementation of the Protocol in the countries with economies in transition by 31 March 1996;   With regard to its organization and functioning:     Proceed with efforts to increase participation of Article 5 country experts, subject to budgetary constraints, and to improve geographical and expertise balance;   Present procedures and criteria for the nomination and selection of members of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel;   Request the Secretariat to appoint a small informal advisory group from both Article 5 and non-Article 5 Parties to meet with the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and to report back to the Parties on the progress made; and   Report to the Parties at the thirteenth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group, in 1996, including:     A description of member expertise highlighting relevance, affiliation, country of residence and period of service to the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel;   Its methods of operation, including appointment of new members to subsidiary bodies, promotion to chair and other matters; and   Options proposed for restructuring the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Technical Options Committees and Working Groups, including the financial and chairing issues in compliance with the terms of reference as set out in various decisions, including decision I/3, and propose adjustments, if deemed necessary, to those terms of reference;       Prepare a document listing the uses and possible applications of ozone-depleting substances listed in Annex C to the Protocol, enabling Parties to collect information on their consumption levels for the purpose of compliance with reporting requirements;   Collaborate with the Industry and Environment Programme Activity Centre of the United Nations Environment Programme to prepare, in accordance with the provisions of decision VII/22, the report on inventory and assessment of technologies and know-how to phase out ozone-depleting substances, including an elaboration of the terms under which transfers of such technology and know-how take place;     That the enhanced participation of the Parties operating under Article 5 and countries with economies in transition should be funded by the Secretariat with an adequate budget allocation or could be also provided by additional voluntary contributions which all Parties are encouraged to offer;   To offer the assistance of the Scientific, Environmental Effects, and Technology and Economic Assessment Panels to the subsidiary body on science and technology under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as necessary;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to present the annual schedules of its meetings and workshops to the Secretariat.
