The  First Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. I/12B:      to agree to the following clarification on the definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substances produced\xe2\x80\x9d in Article 1, paragraph 5:   "Controlled substances produced" as used in Article 1, paragraph 5 is the calculated level of controlled substances manufactured by a Party. This excludes the calculated level of controlled substances entirely used as a feedstock in the manufacture of other chemicals. Excluded also from the term "controlled substances produced" is the calculated level of controlled substances derived from used controlled substances through recycling or recovery processes;    each Party should establish accounting procedures to implement this definition.
