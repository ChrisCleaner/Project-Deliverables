Haeinsa   Temple   Changgyong P\'ango, the Depositories for the Koreana Woodblocks  \n  737  \n  Republic   of Korea  \n  C(iv) (vi)  \n The Committee decided to inscribe this site on the World Heritage List on the basis of criteria (iv) and (vi), in recognition that the Korean version of the Buddhist scriptures (Tripitaka Koreana) at the Haeinsa Temple is one of the most important and most complete corpus of Buddhist doctrinal texts in the world, and is also outstanding for the high aesthetic quality of its workmanship. The buildings in which the scriptures are housed are unique both in terms of their antiquity so far as this specialized type of structure is concerned, and also for the remarkably effective solutions developed in the 15th century to the problems posed by the need to preserve woodblocks against deterioration. \n &nbsp;
