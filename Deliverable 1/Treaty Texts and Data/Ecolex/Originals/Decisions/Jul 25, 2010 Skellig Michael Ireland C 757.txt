The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-10/34.COM/7B, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  32 COM 7B.96 , adopted at its 32nd session (Quebec City, 2008), \n 3.  Acknowledges  the progress achieved through the development of the Skellig Michael Management Plan 2008-2018 prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works and following an extensive consultation process, that was formally submitted to the World Heritage Centre in July 2008; \n 4.  Regrets  that no substantial progress has been made in delivering a fully resourced publication programme to enable the conservation approaches to be fully and widely understood and  urges  the State Party to begin this programme with appropriate scientific advice; \n 5.  Notes  that the first meeting with the boatmen only took place in February 2010 and  requests  the State Party to give higher priority to liaising with stakeholders who transport visitors in order to put in place formally agreed arrangements for landing and timetables; \n 6.  Also regrets  that the State Party did not consider the need for a specific Site Manager to be appointed for the property, and  also requests  that the State Party reconsider this matter or assign a member of the Site Management Team to take lead responsibility; \n 7.  Also urges  the State Party to complete a Risk Assessment and a Visitor Carrying Capacity Study as soon as possible in order to put in place adequate arrangements for visitors that mitigate as far as possible risks to which they may be exposed; \n 8.  Further requests  the State Party to report back on all the points above and the recommendations of the 2007 advisory mission to the World Heritage Centre and the Advisory Bodies by  1 February 2012 .
