Hal Saflieni Hypogeum (Malta)  \n The Committee was informed by the Secretariat that the Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni has now been closed for three years and the air-conditioning works, partly financed by the World Heritage Fund, which should have begun two years ago, have not yet started. This situation is caused by the permanent trickling of water inside the monument as a result of the decayed sewage and water supply pipes layed under the streets adjoining the site. This constant dripping of water encourages the proliferation of microorganisms and of calcium carbonate deposits on the walls which threaten to irreparable damage to the mural paintings. The Committee expressed to the national authorities of Malta its serious concerns and insisted that these problems be treated at government level and that all necessary technical, budgetary, manpower and legal means be immediately placed at the disposal of the national authorities entrusted with conservation in order to: \n a) proceed with the necessary repairs to the sewage pipe system to ensure that the Hypogeum is made impervious; \n b) continue and finish enhancing the site, especially the work partially financed by the World Heritage Fund so that the Hypogium can finally be reopened to the public under conditions which will ensure its conservation. \n The Committee requested the authorities of Malta to submit a detailed report before 1 April 1995 on the progress made in the conservation and management of the site. \n &nbsp;
