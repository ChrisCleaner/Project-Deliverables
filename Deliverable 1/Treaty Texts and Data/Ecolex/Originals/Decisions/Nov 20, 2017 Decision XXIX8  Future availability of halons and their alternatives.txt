Recognizing  that global production of halons for controlled uses was eliminated in 2009, but that some remaining uses, in particular for civil aviation, will continue to rely on stocks of recovered, recycled or reclaimed halons for fire safety for the foreseeable future,    Noting  the adoption by the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization of resolutions A37-9 and A38-9, in which the Assembly expressed an urgent need to continue to develop and implement alternatives to halons for civil aviation,    Taking note  of Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization resolution A39-13, by which the Assembly encouraged the International Civil Aviation Organization to continue collaboration with the Secretariat, through the Halons Technical Options Committee of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, on the topic of alternatives to halons for civil aviation,    Recalling  the information provided by the Panel as requested under decision XXVI/7,    Taking note  of the progress report of the Panel that was provided to the parties before the thirty\xe2\x80\x91ninth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, including the need mentioned therein for better information on existing halon inventories and emissions in civil aviation,   1. To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, through its Halons Technical Options Committee:   (a) To continue to liaise with the International Civil Aviation Organization on the development and implementation of alternatives to halons, and their rate of adoption by civil aviation, and to report thereon in its 2018 progress report;   (b) To explore the possibility of forming a joint working group with the International Civil Aviation Organization to develop and thereafter carry out a study to determine the current and projected future quantities of halons installed in civil aviation fire protection systems, the associated uses and releases of halons from those systems and any potential courses of action that civil aviation could take to reduce those uses and releases;   (c) To submit a report on the work of the joint working group, if established under paragraph 1 (b) above, before the Thirtieth Meeting of the Parties and the fortieth session of the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization for consideration and potential further action;   2. To invite parties, on a voluntary basis, to reassess any national import and export restrictions other than licensing requirements with a view to facilitating the import and export of recovered, recycled or reclaimed halons and the management of stocks of such halons with the aim of enabling all parties to meet remaining needs in accordance with national regulations even as they make the transition to alternatives to halons;   3. To encourage parties to refrain from destroying uncontaminated recovered, recycled or reclaimed halons before they have considered their national and the global long-term future needs for halons, and to consider retaining uncontaminated recovered, recycled or reclaimed halons for anticipated future needs in a manner that employs best practices for storage and maintenance, in order to minimize emissions;
