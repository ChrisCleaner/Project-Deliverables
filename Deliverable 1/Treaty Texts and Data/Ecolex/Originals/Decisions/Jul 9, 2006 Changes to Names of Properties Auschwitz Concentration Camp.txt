Recognizes  the importance of the information and education efforts, directed in particular to the youth, undertaken by many State Parties in order to denounce the atrocities of the Nazi regime;   4.  Recalls  that the criterion for its inscription on the World Heritage List relates to the events of outstanding universal significance that not only depict an evil period of history but also to serve as a beacon of warning to uphold the human values and ideals that are part of the UNESCO constitution declared out of the ashes of the Second World War in 1945;   5.
