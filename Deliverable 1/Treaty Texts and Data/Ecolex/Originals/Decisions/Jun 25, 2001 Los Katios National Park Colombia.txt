V.128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau noted that no information was received from the State Party concerning the proposed IUCN/UNESCO monitoring mission.&nbsp; IUCN informed the Bureau that an IUCN representative would visit Colombia in November 2001 that would be an opportunity to obtain more information to be made available for the Committee meeting in December in Finland. \n V.129&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau requested the Centre and IUCN to collaborate with the State Party to schedule the mission to the site. The programme of a field visit should review the state of conservation of the site, and investigate co-operation possibilities for a World Heritage nomination of the Meso-American biological corridor project and transboundary collaboration with the adjacent Darien National Park (Panama).
