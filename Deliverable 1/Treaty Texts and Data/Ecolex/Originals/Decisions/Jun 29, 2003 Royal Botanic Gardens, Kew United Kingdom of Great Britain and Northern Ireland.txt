Criterion (iii):  Kew Gardens have largely contributed to advances in many scientific disciplines, particularly botany and ecology;.   Criterion (iv):  The landscape gardens and the edifices created by celebrated artists such as Charles Bridgeman, William Kent, Lancelot \xe2\x80\x98Capability\' Brown and William Chambers reflect the beginning of movements which were to have international influence;.  2.  Encourages  the State Party to include on the staff of the Royal Botanic Gardens a landscape architect or other specialist qualified in the history of art and history in general, so that architectural conservation activities can be coordinated on-site; and   3.
