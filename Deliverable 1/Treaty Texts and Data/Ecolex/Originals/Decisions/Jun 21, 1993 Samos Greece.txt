The Bureau was informed that a road construction project, in the immediate vicinity of the Acropolis of Samos, in front of the Tunnel of Eupalinos, was submitted to the Ministry of Culture. The Greek authorities reported that the project is directly under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture, which is of the view that the project will not endanger the site or theTunnel. The Greek Observer pointed out that the road construction is still in the project stage and that the final decision has not yet been taken. \n The Rapporteur stressed that, for an archaeological site of such importance, additional detailed information on the project should be provided, and not merely simple assurances that the project will not endanger the site. The Bureau endorsed this suggestion, and requested the World Heritage Centre to act accordingly. Finally, the Greek Observer stressed the point raised at the last Committee session in Santa Fe regarding the verification of information received by the Secretariat before presenting it to the Committee
