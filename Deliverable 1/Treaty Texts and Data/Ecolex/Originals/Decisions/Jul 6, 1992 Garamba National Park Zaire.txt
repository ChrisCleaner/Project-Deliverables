The Bureau was happy to note that the rhinoceros population in the Park has now increased to 32 individuals due to an increase in the budget and personnel and that the state of conservation of the site continues to be stable. Hence, the Bureau recommended that the Committee, in accordance with the request made by the State Party by letter of 26 February 1991, delete this site from the List of World Heritage in Danger.
