The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/45:     Recalling  that the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which constitutes the primary legal instrument for saving the ozone layer, was signed in the city of Montreal, Canada, on 16 September 1987,    Recognizing  that, to ensure the success of the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol have demonstrated commitment and decisive action by reducing the consumption of ozone-depleting substances since 1986 by 90 per cent,    Considering  that entry into force of the Montreal Protocol has resulted in:     A decline in the level of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere;   The expectation that the ozone layer will recover by about 2050 if there is full compliance with the provisions of the Montreal Protocol;   The avoidance of further significant increases in ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface;     and, thereby, improved the expectations of human health and reduced environmental risks for life on Earth,    Gratified  by the transcendent success of the Montreal Protocol,    Declares  2007 \xe2\x80\x9cInternational Year of the Ozone Layer\xe2\x80\x9d.
