X.29 Tasmanian Wilderness (Australia)  \n The Committee recalled the reports from the twenty-third ordinary and the twenty-third extraordinary session of the Bureau on the state of conservation of this property and adopted the following decision: \n "The Committee requested the Australian Committee for IUCN (ACIUCN) to complete its review process on the state of conservation of the Tasmanian Wilderness with the aim of submitting an up-to-date report to the twenty-fourth session of the Bureau in 2000. ACIUCN\'s review should include reference to any continuing concerns, such as those noted at the twentythird ordinary session of the Bureau, and suggestions relating to any future extension of the World Heritage property and the management of areas of the dedicated Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) reserve system which have been previously identified as having World Heritage value. \n The Committee commended the State Party for the recent completion of the 1999 Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Management Plan, and recommended that its effectiveness be regularly monitored over time." \n &nbsp;
