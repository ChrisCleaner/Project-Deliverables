After having taken note of the Secretariat\'s report, the Bureau expressed its regrets that the Maltese authorities had not responded to the requests of the Committee, and stressed the importance that the requested information be submitted to the Centre by 1 October 1995, so that the World Heritage Committee may evaluate the situation at its nineteenth session and take the measures it deems necessary. \n Following the presentation of the reports concerning these two sites, the Observer of Malta wished to thank the Centre for the work accomplished in close collaboration with the national authorities and for the excellent report resulting from a mission to the site by a member of the Secretariat at the invitation of the authorities responsible for conservation. She explained to the Bureau that the delay was not due to disinterest, but to a serious lack of personnel and, in the case of Hal Saflieni, the necessity that the measures concerning the drainage system should be undertaken by another ministerial department.
