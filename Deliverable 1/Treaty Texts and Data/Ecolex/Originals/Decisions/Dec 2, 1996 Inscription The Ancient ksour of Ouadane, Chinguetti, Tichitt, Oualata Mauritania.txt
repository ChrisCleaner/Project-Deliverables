It introduces the notion of halting places, necessary landmarks of itineraries and trade routes. This new category of space was identified thanks to the Global Strategy. \n The Observer of Mauritania then thanked the members of the Committee and underlined the commitment of his authorities for the rehabilitation of these cities in the framework of integrated development approach. He expressed his gratitude for the efforts of the international community at bilateral and multilateral levels. \n &nbsp;
