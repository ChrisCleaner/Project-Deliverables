Property:  Caves   of the Aggtelek Karst and Slovak Karst  \n Id. N&deg;:  725-858 bis  \n State Party:  Hungary   / Slovakia  \n Criteria \n The Committee approved the incorporation of the Dob&scaron;insk&aacute; Ice Cave as part of the Caves of the Aggtelek Karst and Slovak Karst World Heritage site. Although this ice cave is a relatively small (6km2) and specialised feature, it does add variety to the existing site and its features relate to and complement the Caves of Aggtelek Karst and Slovak Karst. \n The Delegate of Hungary welcomed the extension and the Observer of Slovakia informed the Committee that an intergovernmental agreement between the two States Parties was established in 1999 for joint projects including research, protection and monitoring. \n &nbsp;
