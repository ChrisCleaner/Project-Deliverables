Property:  The High Coast  \n Id. N&deg;:  898  \n State Party:  Sweden    \n Criteria:  N (i)  \n The Committee inscribed The High Coast under natural  criterion (i) . \n  Criterion (i) : The site is one of the places in the world that is experiencing isostatic uplift as a result of deglaciation. Isostatic rebound is well-illustrated and the distinctiveness of the site is the extent of the total isostatic uplift which, at 294m, exceeds others. The site is the "type area" for research on isostacy, the phenomenon having been first recognised and studied there. \n A number of Committee members supported the nomination. The Committee, however, discussed a number of issues relating to the integrity of the site. In light of the evolving management regime, the Committee requested a review of the effectiveness of the management of this site in two year\'s time. \n The Delegate of Finland informed the Committee that the evaluation of the site was beneficial for the preparation of the proposed Kvarken World Heritage nomination. \n In supporting the enlistment, the Delegate of Morocco highlighted the fact that The High Coast was very significant because, apart from Hudson Bay in Canada, it was the most important example of glacio-isostatic uplift and the only icecap and geological feature in the north. \n The Observer of Sweden informed the Committee that the designation of this property is of great importance and thanked the Committee for the constructive review process requiring the production of additional studies. This material will be beneficial for the management of the area. \n &nbsp;
