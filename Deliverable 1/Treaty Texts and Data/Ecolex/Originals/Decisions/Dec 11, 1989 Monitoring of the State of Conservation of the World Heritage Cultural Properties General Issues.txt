18. At its 12th session, the Committee had decided that the results of the second phase of the system of monitoring the state of conservation of cultural properties would be presented at its 14th session in 1990. The Committee at its present session, however, took note of the very low number of replies to the questionnaires reported by the Secretariat. It considered that the system underway was both cumbersome and not fully satisfactory, especially in comparison to the system for monitoring natural sites, and that the system did not enable the Committee to assume this important function efficiently. It was suggested that the role given to ICOMOS and ICCROM be reviewed, and more use be made of non-governmental organizations specialized in cultural heritage conservation, not forgetting to use the structures which already exist in the field, as well as the expertise of the members of the Secretariat. \n &nbsp;
