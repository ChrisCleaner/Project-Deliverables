Recalling  paragraph 7 of decision XXI/6, which allows parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 until 31 December 2010 to deviate from the existing laboratory and analytical use bans in individual cases, where a party considers that this is justified, and asks parties to revisit the issue at the Twenty-Second Meeting of the Parties,    Considering  that the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel did not provide\xc2\xa0all\xc2\xa0information requested by decision XXI/6 in time for the Twenty-Second Meeting of the Parties and that the parties were therefore unable to evaluate the situation in respect of laboratory and analytical uses by parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol,    Noting  that some parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 continue to have difficulty adopting alternatives for those laboratory and analytical uses already banned under the global exemption and need more time for information collection and related policy framework development,   1. To allow parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 until 31 December 2011 to deviate from the existing laboratory and analytical use bans in individual cases, where a party considers that this is justified, and to ask parties to revisit the issue at the Twenty-Third Meeting of the Parties;   2. To request parties to continue to investigate domestically the possibility of replacing ozone-depleting substances in those laboratory and analytical uses listed in the reports of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel prepared in accordance with decisions XVII/10 and XIX/18 and to report progress to the Ozone Secretariat by 30 April 2011;
