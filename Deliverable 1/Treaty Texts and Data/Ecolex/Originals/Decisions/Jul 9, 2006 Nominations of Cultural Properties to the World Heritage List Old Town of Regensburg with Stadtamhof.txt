The World Heritage Committee,   1.  Having examined  Documents  WHC-06/30.COM/8B  and  WHC-06/30.COM/INF.8B.1 ,   2.  Inscribes  the  Old Town of Regensburg with Stadtamhof, Germany , on the World Heritage List on the basis of criteria (ii),(iii) and (iv):    Criterion (ii):  The architecture of Regensburg represents the city\'s role as a medieval trading centre and its influence in the region north of the Alps. Regensburg was an important transition point on continental trade routes to Italy, Bohemia, Russia and Byzantium. It also had multiple connections with the transcontinental Silk Roads. As such, the city exhibits an important interchange of cultural and architectural influences, which have shaped its urban landscape.    Criterion (iii):  The Old Town of Regensburg bears an exceptional testimony to cultural traditions especially in the Holy Roman Empire, being the location for most of the assemblies of the Empire in the High Middle Ages. Regensburg also significantly contributed to more recent European history being the seat of the Perpetual Assembly from the 1663 to 1806. As a testimony to these functions, there are the remains of two imperial palatine palaces from the 9th century, and a large number of other well preserved historic buildings, which are testimony to the wealth and political importance of the community.    Criterion (iv):  The Old Town of Regensburg is an outstanding example of a central-European medieval trading town, which has well preserved its historical stratigraphy, and which is an exceptional illustration to the development of commerce particularly from the 11th to 14th centuries.
