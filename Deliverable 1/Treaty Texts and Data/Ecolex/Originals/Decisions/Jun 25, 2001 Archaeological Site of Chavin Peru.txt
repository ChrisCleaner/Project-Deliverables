V.249&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau noted with concern the very slow progress being made in the elaboration of a Master Plan for the site. It stressed the importance of having a plan to ensure co-ordination of any type of intervention or protective measure. The Bureau encouraged the national authorities to formulate clear objectives for the future protection of the site and incorporate them into a detailed Master Plan at the earliest possible date. Furthermore, it suggested that the international assistance request, that is currently being revised, concentrate on the activities most needed to initiate this process. The Bureau requested that a progress report be submitted by 15 September 2001 for examination by the Bureau at its twenty-fifth extraordinary session.
