The World Heritage Committee,  1. Having examined Document   WHC-05/29.COM/7B.Rev  ,  2. Recalling Decision  7 EXT.COM 4B.1 , adopted at its 7th extraordinary session (UNESCO, 2004), which invited the Director of the World Heritage Centre, in consultation with the Advisory Bodies, to submit at its 29th session proposals on ways and means of optimizing the interrelation between the results of the periodic reporting cycles and the conclusions derived from the state of conservation reports \xe2\x80\x93 in particular in order to ensure consistency and a better conservation of the properties,  3. Noting that discussions have taken place in this regard at a meeting of the Advisory Bodies and the World Heritage Centre (February, 2005) and at a Workshop on \xe2\x80\x9cManagement Effectiveness, Monitoring for World Heritage Value and Statutory Reporting\xe2\x80\x9d (May, 2005),  4. Highlights that there are fundamental differences between the two processes of periodic reporting and reactive monitoring, as indicated in the  Operational   Guidelines; ;  5. Calls for better linkages between both processes in the future, for example, through the following mechanism:  a) the Advisory Bodies and the World Heritage Centre should carefully consider information provided in the periodic reports corresponding to the relevant States Parties, when preparing state of conservation reports -in particular, by using the information provided on threats to the properties to focus the attention of reactive monitoring;  b) States Parties should take into account the content and decisions of previous state of conservation reports when preparing their propertyspecific periodic reports; and, in particular, provide an update on threats highlighted through the reactive monitoring process and on the measures taken by the State Party to mitigate these threats; and  c) A database currently being developed by the World Heritage Centre on World Heritage properties should allow for cross-referencing between state of conservation and periodic reports to enhance consistency in reporting mechanisms and to ensure that follow-up action is taken as necessary;  6. Requests the World Heritage Centre and the Advisory Bodies to take this issue up at the forthcoming meetings leading to and during the \xe2\x80\x9creflection year\xe2\x80\x9d for the periodic reporting process.
