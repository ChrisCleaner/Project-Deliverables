Wet Tropics of Queensland (Australia)  \n The Committee noted that, as requested at the time of the inscription of this property on the World Heritage List in 1988, IUCN had undertaken a review mission to the site. The Committee learnt with satisfaction that despite a slow start, the management of the Wet Tropics area had achieved much progress, particularly with respect to: \n (a) establishing a headquarters and appointment of staff;  (b) drafting legislation;  (c) preparing management plans and site plans;  (d) carrying out a number of policy-relevant studies;  (e) setting-up advisory committees and a management authority;  (f) improving budgetary allocations for site management, and  (g) rehabilitating degraded forest areas. \n The Committee commended the Australian authorities for taking these steps for ensuring the adequate management of this site and requested IUCN and the World Heritage Centre to continue to monitor progress. \n &nbsp;
