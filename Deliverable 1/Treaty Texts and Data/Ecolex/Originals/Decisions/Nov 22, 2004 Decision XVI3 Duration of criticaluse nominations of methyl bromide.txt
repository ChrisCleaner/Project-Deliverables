The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/3:    Mindful that decision Ex.I/4, under paragraph 9 (e), requested the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to review critical-use nominations on an annual basis and to apply the criteria set forth in decision IX/6 and of other relevant criteria agreed by the Parties,    Recognizing  that decision Ex.I/3, under paragraph 6, asked the Parties to take note of the proposal by the United States of America on multi-year exemptions, and to consider the elaboration of criteria and a methodology for authorizing multi-year exemptions,     To agree that the basis for extending the duration of critical-use nominations and exemptions of methyl bromide to periods greater than one year requires further attention;   To elaborate, as far as possible, at the Seventeenth Meeting of Parties a framework for spreading a critical-use exemption over more than one year and to agree that the following elements, among others, should be taken into account:     Annual reporting on:     Status of re-registration and review of methyl bromide;   Status of registration of alternatives and substitutes for methyl bromide;   Efforts to evaluate, commercialize and secure national regulatory approval of alternatives and substitutes;     Assessment of requests to reconsider approved critical-use exemptions in the case of exceptional circumstances;   Review of downward trends for different instances;   Assessments of nominations in the light of the alternatives database referred to in paragraph 1 of decision Ex.I/4, and comparisons with management strategies;   Applicability of existing decisions to methyl bromide critical-use exemptions longer than one year;   Additional conditions applicable to critical-use exemptions longer than one year;     To consider the technical justifications for spreading a critical-use exemption over more than one year, taking into account, among others, the following instances:     Where the use patterns of methyl bromide are not regular on an annual or seasonal basis;     Where, for a specific use, no alternatives or emerging solutions are anticipated for several years;   Where a plan of implementation of an alternative stretches over several years;   Where management strategies include a complete time-bound phase-out for a nomination or sector or use.
