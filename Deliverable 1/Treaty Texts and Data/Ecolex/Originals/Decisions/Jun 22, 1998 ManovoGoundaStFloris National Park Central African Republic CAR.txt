The Bureau recalled that the Committee, at its last session, was seriously concerned about the uncontrolled poaching by armed groups which had resulted in the death of four members of the Park staff in 1997 and the decimation of more than 80% of the Park\'s wildlife populations. Deteriorating security conditions had brought tourism to a halt. The Committee had welcomed the efforts of the Government of CAR to assign site management responsibilities to a private Foundation and had requested the Centre and IUCN to contact the State Party and the Foundation to prepare a detailed state of conservation report and rehabilitation plan for the site. The Bureau noted that the State Party has not responded to the Centre&rsquo;s letter outlining the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations made at its last session in December 1997.&nbsp; \n The Bureau reiterated the Committee&rsquo;s request that the Centre and IUCN contact the State Party and the Foundation to prepare a detailed state of conservation report and a rehabilitation plan for the site and recommended that the Committee retain this site in the List of World Heritage in Danger.
