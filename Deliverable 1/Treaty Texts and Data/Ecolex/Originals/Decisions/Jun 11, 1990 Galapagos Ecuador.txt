The Bureau was specifically concerned with the capturing of about 40,000 sharks, using locally captured sea-lions as baits, in the marine waters surrounding the Galapagos world heritage site. Although the capture of sharks had been temporarily halted following protests from international agencies, the effectiveness of the ban was uncertain. The Bureau recalled that preparatory assistance from the World Heritage Fund had been provided in 1987 for nominating the marine areas surrounding the Galapagos National Park for inclusion as part of the world heritage site but noted that no such nomination has thus far been received by the Committee. The Bureau was also concerned thatthe number of tourists using the area is 100 per cent greater than the estimated carrying capacity for the area and is likely to continue to increase. The Bureau noted that the Chairman of the Committee had approved US $14,000 during April 1990 for a technical co-operation project to study the problem of excessive frequentation of this site by tourists. The Bureau recommended that the Secretariat request the Ecuadorian authorities to (a) extend the boundaries of the world heritage site to include the surrounding marine areas; and (b) submit a technical report on the study of over-visiting of the site for the consideration of the Committee at its fourteenth session in December 1990.
