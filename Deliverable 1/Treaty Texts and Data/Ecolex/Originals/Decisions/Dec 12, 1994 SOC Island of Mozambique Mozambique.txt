Island   of Mozambique (Mozambique)  \n The Committee took note of a report presented by the UNDP/UNESCO Project on the state of conservation of the Island of Mozambique. It was reported that the stone city on the island was in a precarious state of conservation, a situation that was heavily aggravated by the cyclone Nadia which occurred in March 1994. The predominantly privately owned houses in the macuti city were better maintained. \n With the process of pacification and the possibilities of a sound economic development of the region, the monitoring mission recommended that: \n \n the recuperation of the island be undertaken within the framework of an integral development project; \n UNESCO coordinates bilateral and inter/multilateral cooperation for the island, particluarly in the field of training; \n a mission be fielded of a funding specialist and a conservation architect to oversee restoration. \n \n &nbsp;
