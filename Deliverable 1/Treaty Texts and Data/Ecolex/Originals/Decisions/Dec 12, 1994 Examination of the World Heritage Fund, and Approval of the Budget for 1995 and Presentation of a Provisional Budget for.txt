XIII.1  The Committee approved the report of the Working Group on the World Heritage Fund, budget and development of the Centre. Revisions to the budget format were prepared and, following considerable discussions, a budget of US$ 2,935,000 was approved for 1995, and an indicative budget of US$ 2,885,000 for 1996 was noted. \n  XIII.2  The Committee recommended that the Secretariat should continue to strengthen its efforts towards a more transparent budget. The budget document should clearly reflect increases or decreases in line items with a rationale for the action taken. \n  XIII. 3&nbsp; On more specific items, the Committee decided the following: \n a) the Committee recommended that the Emergency Fund be replenished and that the States Parties should be encouraged to make special contributions to that Fund; \n b) the Committee recommended that the technical assistance budget should respect the division of funds in the order of at least one-third for natural heritage and two-third for cultural heritage. With respect to training the budget should be divided evenly between the two sectors; \n c)&nbsp;the Committee, as in 1994, retained a sum of US$ 40,000 for monitoring activities of ICOMOS during 1995. \n d)&nbsp;the Committee did not approve any funds for the Organization of the World Heritage Cities; \n e) with respect to the promotion budget the Committee did not approve any funds to meet costs for the protection of the logo. The Committee, however, approved a sum not exceeding US$ 45,000 for the organization of an exhibit entitled "From Abou Simbel to Angkor" within the framework of the 50th anniversary of UNESCO; \n f) the Committee stressed that the Bureau must fully observe the Operational Guidelines with respect to all budgetary matters. In this regard the Committee requested that possible revisions to the Guidelines be submitted to the next session of the Bureau; \n g) The Committee approved a sum of US$ 360,000 for assistance to the Centre, including the expenses of a P-5 position for natural heritage for one transitional year (1995). \n  XIII.4&nbsp; The Committee approved the budget for 1995 and noted the indicative budget for 1996 as follows: \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n  Items  \n \n \n  1995  Approved  \n \n \n  1996  Indicative  \n \n \n \n \n  1.
