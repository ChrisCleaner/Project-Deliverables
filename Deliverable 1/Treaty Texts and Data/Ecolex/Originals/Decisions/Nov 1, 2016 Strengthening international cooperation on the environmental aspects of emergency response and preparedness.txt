The Governing Council,\nReaffirming its view that there are inherent linkages between environmental, humanitarian and\ndevelopment outcomes, and that there is a need to identify and address environmental risks linked to\nnatural and man-made disasters as defined in subprogramme 2 of the programme of work of the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme, on disasters and conflicts,35\nWelcoming the role of the United Nations Environment Programme as the focal point for\nenvironment in respect of needs assessments carried out in the United Nations system and within the\nhumanitarian coordination system through the Inter-Agency Standing Committee cluster approach,\nNoting with concern the extent to which the current limitations of international emergency\nresponse systems could unintentionally amplify the environmental impacts of natural and man-made\ndisasters, and recognizing that greater efforts and support are needed to assist affected countries, upon\ntheir request, to respond to and manage environmental risks and impacts,\nAcknowledging the need to tackle the underlying factors that contribute to an increased risk of\ndisaster,\nExpressing concern at the possible future impacts of climate change, such as increases in the\nfrequency, intensity and unpredictability of extreme hydrological and meteorological events, which\ncould contribute to corresponding increases in the number and scale of disasters and the need for\ninternational assistance for prevention, response and recovery,\nTaking into account the vulnerability of developing countries, including the most vulnerable,\nsuch as small island developing States and least developed countries, to natural hazards and the\nenvironmental impacts of natural and man-made disasters, which could undermine the attainment of\ninternationally agreed development goals such as the Millennium Development Goals,\nRecalling General Assembly resolutions 44/224 of 22 December 1989, on international\ncooperation in the monitoring, assessment and anticipation of environmental threats and in assistance\nin cases of environmental emergency, and 46/182 of 19 December 1991 and 58/114 of 17 December\n2003 on strengthening the coordination of humanitarian emergency assistance by the United Nations,\nRecalling also its decisions 21/17 of 9 February 2001 and 22/8 of 7 February 2003 on further\nimprovement of environmental emergency prevention, preparedness, assessment, response and\nmitigation,\nNoting that the medium-term strategy for the period 2010\xe2\x80\x932013 identifies disasters and\nconflicts as one of six cross-cutting thematic priorities of the United Nations Environment Programme,\nWelcoming the continued collaboration between the United Nations Environment Programme\nand the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, through their Joint Environment Unit, as\nthe principal multilateral tool for mobilizing and coordinating international response to environmental\nemergencies,\nRecalling the Hyogo Declaration and the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005\xe2\x80\x932015 adopted by\nthe General Assembly in its resolution 60/195 of 22 December 2005, which outline relevant principles\nfor disaster risk reduction and disaster preparedness at all levels,\nNoting with appreciation the development of specialized expertise within the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme on mainstreaming environmental issues in humanitarian operations to\nminimize possible environmental impacts and ensure that they do no harm with regard to longer-term\nvulnerability and development,\nRecalling also that, while it is a primary responsibility of Governments to establish, where\npossible, adequate structures, procedures and capacities for responding to environmental risks,\npreventive action and preparedness should always be prioritized as the means of dealing with such\nrisks stemming from natural and man-made disasters,
