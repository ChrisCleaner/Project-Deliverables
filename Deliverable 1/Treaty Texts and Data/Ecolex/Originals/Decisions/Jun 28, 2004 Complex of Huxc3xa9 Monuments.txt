The World Heritage Committee, \n \n Recognizing the vulnerability of this World Heritage property in the context of the present economic and urban development in Vietnam, \n  Congratulates  the State Party and the local authorities for the excellent restoration work carried out on the monumental heritage of the citadel and along the Perfume River, and for its initiatives as concerns the enhancement of the landscaped heritage surrounding the citadel; \n  Strongly urges  the State Party to take immediately into account the recommendations of the UNESCO mission of November 2003; \n  Encourages  the State Party to proceed with the complete inventory of the traditional monumental and urban heritage, as well as the illegal constructions, or those having a negative impact on the property; \n  Expresses  its grave concern regarding the development of the road infrastructure and the modern constructions in and around the citadel, and notably with regard to the potential danger of the urban infrastructure of Hu\xc3\xa9 and its surroundings passing from level 2 to level 1; \n  Requests  the State Party to urgently elaborate regulations for the management of the entire property, which, far from being simple rules for protection, should be the starting point of a project for long-term development and enhancement and should take into account all the components of the property at their different levels of understanding; \n  Invites  the State Party to consider an eventual re-nomination of the property to take into account the unique landscape value of the environment of Hu\xc3\xa9, and to ensure reinforced protection of the monuments associated with the citadel of Hu\xc3\xa9 situated along the Perfume River; \n  Further requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by 1 February 2005, a report on the progress made in the implementation of the recommendations of the UNESCO mission of November 2003, for examination by the Committee at its 29th session in 2005.
