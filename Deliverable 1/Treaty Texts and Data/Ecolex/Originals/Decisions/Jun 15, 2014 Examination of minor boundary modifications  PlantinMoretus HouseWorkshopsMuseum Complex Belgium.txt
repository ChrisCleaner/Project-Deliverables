The World Heritage Committee, \n \n  Having examined  Documents WHC-14/38.COM/8B.Add, and WHC-14/38.COM/INF.8B1.Add, \n  Welcomes  the efforts of the State Party to reinforce the management of interventions in the buffer zone of its World Heritage properties through a new executive order; \n  Recognizes  that, considering this new executive order, a general re-evaluation of the buffer zones is necessary; \n  Does not approve  the proposed minor modification to the boundary of the buffer zone for the  Plantin-Moretus House-Workshops-Museum Complex, Belgium,  and  invites  the State Party in collaboration with the Advisory Body to work out a new proposal for a relevant and feasible buffer zone for the property, taking into account the provisions of the new executive order, to be discussed by the World Heritage Committee at its 39th session in 2015.
