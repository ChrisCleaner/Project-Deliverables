The World Heritage Committee,   1.  Having examined  Documents  WHC-06/30.COM/8B  and  WHC-06/30.COM/INF.8B.1 ,   2.  Inscribes  the  Stone Circles of Senegambia, Gambia and Senegal , on the World Heritage List on the basis of criteria (i) and (iii):    Criterion (i):  The finely worked individual stones display precise and skilful stone working practices and contribute to the imposing order and grandeur of the overall stone circle complexes.    Criterion (iii):  The nominated stone circles, represent the wider megalithic zone, in which the survival of so many circles is a unique manifestation of construction and funerary practices which persisted for over a millennia and a half across a large sweep of landscape, and reflects a sophisticated and productive society.   3.  Recommends  that the States Parties give consideration to extending the nominated sites to include quarry sites;   4.  Also recommends  that the States Parties consider nominating further sites as part of a wider cultural landscape serial nomination in order to sustain more of the megalithic landscape of Senegambia;   5.  Further recommends  that a research strategy be put in place to address the wider associations of the stone circles and to record in more detail the megalithic zone.
