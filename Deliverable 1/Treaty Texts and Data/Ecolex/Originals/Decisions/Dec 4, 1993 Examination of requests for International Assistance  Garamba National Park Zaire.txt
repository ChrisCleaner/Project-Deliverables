A. NATURAL HERITAGE  \n   A.1 Requests on which the Bureau took a decision   \n  A.1.4 Emergency Assistance  \n  A.1.4.1 Garamba National Park (Zaire)  \n The Bureau  recalled  that this site was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger at the sixteenth session of the Committee. The Bureau  discussed  the request for US$20,000 and  approved  the sum of  US$10,000 . \n The Bureau  noted  that the emergency circumstances under which this request was originally submitted have changed substantially and therefore  requested  the World Heritage Centre to write to IZCN and request further clarification on this project. Following the review of the project, a further US$10,000 could be released. IUCN informed the Bureau that the project will be implemented by the WWF at the request of IZCN. \n The Bureau had an extensive discussion on the general state of unrest in Zaire and  voiced concern  with respect to the future conservation of the four listed sites in Zaire.&nbsp;&nbsp;
