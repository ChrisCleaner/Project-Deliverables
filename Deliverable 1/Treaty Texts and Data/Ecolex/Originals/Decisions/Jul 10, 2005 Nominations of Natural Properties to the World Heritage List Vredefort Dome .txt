The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Having examined  Documents   WHC-05/29.COM/8B  ,   WHC- 05/29.COM/8B.Add 2  and   WHC-05/29.COM/INF.8B.2   ,  2.  Inscribes   Vredefort Dome  (South Africa), on the World Heritage List on the basis of natural criterion (i) :   Criterion (i):  Vredefort Dome is the oldest, largest, and most deeply eroded complex meteorite impact structure in the world. It is the site of the world\'s greatest single, known energy release event. It contains high quality and accessible geological (outcrop) sites which demonstrate a range of geological evidences of a complex meteorite impact structure. The rural and natural landscapes of the serial property help portray the magnitude of the ring structures resulting from the impact. The serial nomination is considered to be a representative sample of a complex meteorite impact structure. A comprehensive comparative analysis with other complex meteorite impact structures demonstrated that it is the only example on earth providing a full geological profile of an astrobleme below the crater floor, thereby enabling research into the genesis and development of an astrobleme immediately post impact.  3.  Noting  that the freehold status of the majority of the nominated property requires special management and collaboration with landowners to ensure the integrity of the property,  4.  Requests  the State Party of South Africa to clearly define the legal boundaries for the three satellite component sites of the serial property;  5.  Also requests  that the State Party completes and starts to implement the management plan for the entire property within two years of inscription, and ensures that this plan has the support of key stakeholders;  6.  Further requests  the State Party to invite an IUCN mission within two years of inscription to evaluate progress with the above actions.
