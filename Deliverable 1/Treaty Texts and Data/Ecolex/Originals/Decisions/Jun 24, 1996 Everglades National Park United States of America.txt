The Bureau recalled that the site was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1993 and that the World Heritage Committee at its last session examined a detailed monitoring report, presented by the State Party, which outlined the long&shy;term restoration work necessary to restore the balance of the Everglades ecosystem. The State Party presented a preliminary monitoring report dated May 1996 outlining the Government\'s efforts to protect the site. The report acknowledges that despite significant progress made (acquisition of additional land, improved ecological indicators), the Park remains seriously in danger. \n Due to the long-term nature of the rehabilitation activities and further to the conclusions of the Committee, the Bureau recommended that the site remain on the List of World Heritage in Danger until further rehabilitation is demonstrated.
