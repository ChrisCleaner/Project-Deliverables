The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/17:      To note that the implementation of the Protocol by those Parties that have reported data is satisfactory;   To note with appreciation that 175 Parties out of the 184 that should have reported data for 2003 have now done so, but that the following Parties have still not reported to date: Botswana, Lesotho, Liberia, Micronesia (Federated States of), Nauru, Russian Federation, Solomon Islands, Turkmenistan and Tuvalu;   To note further that the Federated States of Micronesia has also still not reported data for 2001 and 2002;   To note that this places those Parties in non-compliance with their data-reporting obligations under the Montreal Protocol and to urge them, where appropriate, to work closely with the implementing agencies to report the required data to the Secretariat as a matter of urgency, and to request the Implementation Committee to review the situation of those Parties at its next meeting;   To note also that lack of timely data reporting by Parties impedes effective monitoring and assessment of Parties\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with their obligations under the Montreal Protocol;   To recall decision XV/15, which encouraged the Parties to forward data on consumption and production to the Secretariat as soon as the figures were available, and preferably by 30 June each year, in order to enable the Implementation Committee to make recommendations in good time before the Meeting of the Parties;   To note further with appreciation that 92 Parties out of the 184 that could have reported data by 30 June 2004 succeeded in meeting that deadline;   To note also that reporting by 30 June each year greatly facilitates the work of the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund in assisting Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 to comply with the control measures of the Montreal Protocol;   To encourage Parties to continue to report consumption and production data as soon as the figures are available, and preferably by 30 June each year, as agreed in decision XV/15.
