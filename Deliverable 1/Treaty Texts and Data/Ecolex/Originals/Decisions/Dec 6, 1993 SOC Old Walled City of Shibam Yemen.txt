Old Walled City of Shibam (Yemen)  \n Referring to the torrential rains in spring 1993 which affected a number of houses of the Old City of Shibam, the Director of the Division of Cultural and Physical Heritage and the Delegate of Germany presented the slides made by a German film producer who had visited the site. Emphasizing the different threats being faced by Shibam, they both drew the attention of Committee members to the importance of emergency assistance to repair the sewerage network, the modernisation of traditional irrigation systems and maintenance work to make the terraces of the \'tower-houses\', which characterize this City, waterproof. \n &nbsp;
