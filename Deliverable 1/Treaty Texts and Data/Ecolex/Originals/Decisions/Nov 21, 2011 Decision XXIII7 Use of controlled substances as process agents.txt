Taking note  with appreciation of the 2011 progress report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel as it pertains to process agents,    Recalling  that tables A and B of decision X/14 on process agent uses have been updated by decisions XV/6, XVII/7, XIX/15, XXI/3 and XXII/8,    Noting  that the Panel\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 progress report takes into account the information provided by parties and the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol in accordance with decision XXI/3,    Noting  also that in the 2011 progress report the Panel proposes the removal of 27 processes from table A and indicates that only four parties reported process agent uses in 2009,    Noting  with appreciation that most parties reported significantly lower emissions than those listed in table B,    Acknowledging  the role that emissions from process agent uses might play in contributing to the abundance of carbon tetrachloride in the atmosphere and the need to reduce such emissions,    Recalling  that according to decision IV/12 emissions of insignificant quantities of controlled substances, including from their use as process agents, are not considered to be controlled substances as defined in Article 1 of the Montreal Protocol,     Recalling also  that decision IV/12 urges parties to take steps to minimize emissions of ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting substances used as process agents, including such steps as avoidance of the creation of such emissions and reduction of emissions using practicable control technologies, process changes, containment or destruction,     Recalling further  decision XIX/15, in which the parties agreed to classify the use of carbon tetrachloride for the production of vinyl chloride monomer as a process agent use,    1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To update tables A and table B of decision X/14 as set out in the annex to the present decision;   2.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To urge those parties that have yet to submit information on process agent uses as requested in decisions X/14 and XXI/3 to do so as a matter of urgency, and no later than 31 March 2012;    3.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To remind parties that have provided information in accordance with decision XXI/3 indicating that they have process agent uses to provide further information, in particular on controlled substances and process agent applications in accordance with decision X/14, using the format available from the Ozone Secretariat;    4.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To urge the parties listed in table B to revisit their maximum values and to report to the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel on how those values might be reduced, particularly in view of the process agent uses that have ceased;    5.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Panel, as further uses cease in the future, to consider corresponding reductions in make-up or consumption and maximum emissions accordingly in future proposals concerning table B;    6.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Panel to provide for the thirty-second meeting of the Open\xe2\x80\x91ended Working Group a summary report updating its findings on process agent uses, taking into account relevant information from previous investigations and including:    (a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A descriptive overview of the processes using ozone-depleting substances as process agents;   (b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Information about alternatives to ozone-depleting substances in process-agent uses;   (c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Information on quantities used for process agent uses as reported in accordance with article 7 of the Montreal Protocol;   (d)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Information on estimated emissions of ozone-depleting substances from process\xe2\x80\x91agent uses and their impact on the ozone layer and the climate;   (e)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Practicable measures to avoid and reduce emissions from process-agent uses;   7.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To revisit the use of controlled substances as process agents at the thirty-second meeting of the Open-ended Working Group;
