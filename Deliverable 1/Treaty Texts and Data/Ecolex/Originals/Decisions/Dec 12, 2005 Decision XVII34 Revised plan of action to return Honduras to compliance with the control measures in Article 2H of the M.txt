The  Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVII/34:      To note that Honduras ratified the Montreal Protocol on 14 October 1993 and the London and Copenhagen Amendments on 24 January 2002, is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol in 1996. Since approval of the country programme, the Executive Committee has approved $3,342,025 from the Multilateral Fund to enable compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;   To recall decision XV/35, which noted that Honduras was in non-compliance in 2002 with its obligations under Article 2H of the Montreal Protocol to freeze its consumption of the controlled substance in Annex E (methyl bromide) at its baseline level of 259.43 ODP-tonnes, but also noted with appreciation the plan of action submitted by Honduras to ensure its prompt return to compliance in 2005;   To note with concern, however, that while Honduras has reported consumption of methyl bromide for 2004 of 340.80 ODP-tonnes that is less than its reported consumption for 2003, it is still inconsistent with the Party\xe2\x80\x99s commitment contained in decision XV/35 to reduce its methyl bromide consumption to 306.1 ODP-tonnes in 2004;   Further to note the advice of Honduras that its stakeholders remain committed to methyl bromide phase out and that an additional two years would be required to overcome the technical difficulties that were the cause of the Party\xe2\x80\x99s deviation from its commitments contained in decision XV/35;   To note with appreciation that Honduras has submitted a revised plan of action for methyl bromide phase-out in controlled uses, and to note, without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Protocol, that under the revised plan Honduras specifically commits itself:     To reduce methyl bromide consumption from 340.80 ODP-tonnes in 2004 as follows:     To 327.6000 ODP-tonnes in 2005;   To 295.8000 ODP-tonnes in 2006;   To 255.0000 ODP-tonnes in 2007;   To 207.5424 ODP-tonnes in 2008;     To monitor its system for licensing imports and exports of ozone-depleting substances, including quotas, in force since May 2003;   To monitor its ban on imports of equipment using ozone-depleting substances, in force since May 2003;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 5 above should enable Honduras to return to compliance with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s methyl bromide control measures in 2008 and to urge Honduras to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase out consumption of the controlled substance in Annex E (methyl bromide);   To monitor closely the progress of Honduras with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of the controlled substance in Annex E (methyl bromide). To the degree that Honduras is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Honduras should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Honduras, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner, the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of methyl bromide that is the subject of non-compliance is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
