The Hermitage, St. Petersburg (Russian Federation)  \n At the request of the authorities of the Russian Federation, the Director-General decided to launch a large scale project for the rehabilitation of the Hermitage Museum. Two missions were organized in 1993 in which experts of the Kimbell Art Museum of Houston, and the Metropolitan Museum, New York, (USA) participated. Furthermore, UNESCO requested a consultant engineering firm in Edinburgh, (UK), to identify different components for a rehabilitation programme for the Hermitage Museum. This group of architects/engineers visited the site in September and November 1993 to prepare, together with Russian specialists, the rehabilitation programme for the buildings of the complex. A progress report would be submitted for information to the Bureau. \n &nbsp;
