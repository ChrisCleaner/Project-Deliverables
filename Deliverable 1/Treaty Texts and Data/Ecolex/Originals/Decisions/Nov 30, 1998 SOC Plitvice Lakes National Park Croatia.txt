VII.22 Plitvice Lakes National Park (Croatia)  \n Since the Committee decided to remove this site from the List of World Heritage in Danger at its twenty-first session, the Centre has received a brief status report on the site\'s protection. A seven-member Administrative Council is responsible for the management of the site. The Park has statutes and rules of procedures, with regulating principles for residents, staff and visitors. Further positive results have been achieved with the efforts to limit traffic through the Park by the construction of a detour around the Park. The authorities had provided a map showing the extension of the Park\'s boundaries by about 100 km2. The map has been returned to the Croatian authorities requesting them, in accordance with the recommendation of the last session of the Committee, to nominate the extension of the 100 km2 using standard nomination procedures set out in paragraph 64 of the Operational Guidelines. \n The Committee commended the authorities for their continuing efforts to enhance the protection of Plitvice Lakes National Park and urged them to nominate, as soon as possible, the 100km2 extension, using standard nomination procedures set out in paragraph 64 of the Operational Guidelines. \n &nbsp;
