The  Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVII/36:      To note that Kyrgyzstan ratified the Montreal Protocol on 31 May 2000, is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol in July 2002. The Executive Committee has approved $1,206,732 from the Multilateral Fund to enable the Party\xe2\x80\x99s compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;   To note further that Kyrgyzstan has reported annual consumption for the controlled substances in Annex A, group II (halons), for 2004 of 2.40 ODP-tonnes, which exceeds the Party\xe2\x80\x99s maximum allowable consumption level of zero ODP-tonnes for those controlled substances for that year, and that Kyrgyzstan is therefore in non-compliance with the control measures under the Protocol;   To note with appreciation Kyrgyzstan\xe2\x80\x99s submission of a plan of action to ensure a prompt return to compliance with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s halon control measures, and to note that, under the plan, without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Protocol, Kyrgyzstan specifically commits itself:     To maintain consumption of the controlled substances in Annex A, group II (halons), at no more than the 2004 level of 2.40 ODP-tonnes in 2005, and then to reduce halon consumption as follows:     To 1.20 ODP-tonnes in 2006;   To 0.60 ODP-tonnes in 2007;   To phase out consumption of these controlled substances by 1 January 2008, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To monitor its existing system for licensing imports and exports of ozone-depleting substances;   To introduce a ban on the import of equipment containing halons and equipment that uses halons by 1 January 2006;   To introduce an import quota system to limit annual consumption of the controlled substances in Annex A, group II (halons), by the beginning of 2006;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 3 above should enable Kyrgyzstan to return to compliance in 2008 and to urge Kyrgyzstan to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase out consumption of the controlled substances in Annex A, group II (halons);   To monitor closely the progress of Kyrgyzstan with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of Annex A, group II, controlled substances (halons). To the degree that the Party is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Kyrgyzstan should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Kyrgyzstan, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that it fails to remain in compliance, the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of Annex A, group II, controlled substances (halons) that are the subject of non-compliance is ceased so that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
