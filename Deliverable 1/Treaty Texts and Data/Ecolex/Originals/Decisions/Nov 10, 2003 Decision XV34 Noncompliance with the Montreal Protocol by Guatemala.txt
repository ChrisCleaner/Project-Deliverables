The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/34:      To note that Guatemala ratified the Montreal Protocol on 7 November 1989 and the London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments on 21 January 2002. Guatemala is classified as a Party operating under Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee in 1993. Since approval of the country programme, the Executive Committee has approved $6,302,694 from the Multilateral Fund to enable compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;   To note also that Guatemala\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for Annex A, group I substances is 224.6 ODP-tonnes. It reported consumption of 239.6 ODP-tonnes of Annex A, group I substances in 2002. Guatemala\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for the controlled substance in Annex E is 400.7 ODP-tonnes. It reported consumption of 709.4 ODP-tonnes of the controlled substance in Annex E in 2002. As a consequence, for 2002 Guatemala was in non-compliance with its obligations under Articles 2A and 2H of the Montreal Protocol;   To note with appreciation Guatemala\xe2\x80\x99s submission of its plan of action to ensure a prompt return to compliance with the control measures for Annex A, group I and Annex E substances, and to note further that, under the plan, without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Montreal Protocol, Guatemala specifically commits itself:     To reducing CFC consumption from 239.6 ODP-tonnes in 2002 as follows:     To 180.5 ODP-tonnes in 2003;   To 120 ODP-tonnes in 2004;   To 85 ODP-tonnes in 2005;   To 50 ODP-tonnes in 2006;   To 20 ODP-tonnes in 2007;   To phasing out CFC consumption by 1 January 2010, as required under the Montreal Protocol, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To reducing methyl bromide consumption from 709.4 ODP-tonnes in 2002, as follows:     To 528 ODP-tonnes in 2003;   To 492 ODP-tonnes in 2004;   To 360 ODP-tonnes in 2005;   To 335 ODP-tonnes in 2006;   To 310 ODP-tonnes in 2007;   To 286 ODP-tonnes in 2008;   To phasing out methyl bromide consumption by 1 January 2015, as required under the Montreal Protocol, save for critical uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To establishing, by 2004, a system for licensing imports and exports of ODS, including quotas;   To banning, by 2005, imports of ODS-using equipment;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 3 above should enable Guatemala to return to compliance by 2005 (CFCs) and 2007 (methyl bromide), and to urge Guatemala to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase out consumption of ozone-depleting substances in Annex A, group I and Annex E;   To monitor closely the progress of Guatemala with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of CFCs and methyl bromide. To the degree that Guatemala is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Guatemala should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Guatemala, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of CFCs and methyl bromide (that is, the subjects of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
