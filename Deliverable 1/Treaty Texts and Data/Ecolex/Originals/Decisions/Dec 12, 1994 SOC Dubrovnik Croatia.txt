Dubrovnik   (Croatia)  \n The Committee was informed that the restoration of what is called the fifth facade of the city -the roofs- was almost completed and that there remained but a few insulae awaiting repairs, and that important progress had been made  in  the restoration of several of the most important monuments of the city. \n The Committee commended the Government of Croatia and UNESCO on the progress made in the conservation and restoration of Dubrovnik. It noted, however, that after the priority needs had been taken care of, other works such as the restoration of nine destroyed palaces and details of Franciscan and Dominican cloisters needed to be undertaken. The Committee decided, therefore, to retain this site on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n &nbsp;
