The Centre informed the Bureau that the Workshop on the transfrontier Darien Ecosystem took place in Bogota on 25 and 26 May 2000 and that a representative from IUCN&rsquo;s World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) participated. However, no field mission to the site was possible as no security clearance could be obtained from UNDP due to the continuing conflicts in the region.&nbsp; IUCN noted the continuing challenges in managing this area, but applauded the efforts of the Fundacion Natura and the State Party to attempt to implement co-management arrangements. IUCN pointed out that the Workshop noted the continued instability in the area and that activities are impacting the contiguous Darien World Heritage site in Panama. When the situation improves this may be an area for IUCN&rsquo;s Parks for Peace initiative &ndash; a joint project being developed by IUCN and the University of Peace (Costa Rica). IUCN noted the warnings from the UN Security Office dated 29 March 2000 about travel to Colombia.&nbsp; The Observer of Colombia informed the Bureau that her authorities are looking into new dates for a mission. \n The Bureau reiterated the Committee&rsquo;s request for a mission to the site to obtain detailed information on the state of conservation and requested the State Party to inform the Centre on the possibility of an on-site field mission.
