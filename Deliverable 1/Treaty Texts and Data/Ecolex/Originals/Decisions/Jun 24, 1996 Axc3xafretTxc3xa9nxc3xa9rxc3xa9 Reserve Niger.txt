The Bureau recalled that the site was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1992 as it was affected by civil disturbances and that a peace agreement was signed on 9 October 1994. In 1995 a dialogue was established between the parties, which has paved the way for a return to a normal situation and may allow for a detailed evaluation of the state of conservation of the site as well as the development of an action programme for its recovery. \n The Bureau was informed that an IUCN project of 1 Million US$ is underway at the site to assist in re-establishing the management regime and that a report from the project will be available in August 1996. The Delegate of Niger underlined that a mission would be necessary to evaluate the situation. \n The Bureau recommended that the 20th extraordinary session of the Bureau in November 1996 may wish to examine the report that will be provided by IUCN on the site, and subsequently may wish to consider whether the site should remain on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
