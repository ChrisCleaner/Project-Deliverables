The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-10/34.COM/7B, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  33 COM 7A.25 , adopted at its 33rd session (Seville, 2009), \n 3.  Notes with great concern  that the State Party report indicates that demolitions and rebuilding are being approved without heritage impact assessments being undertaken to consider the impact on the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n 4.  Reiterates and extends its requests  to the State Party to: \n a) Formally approve the Conservation Master Plan (CMP), integrate it within the Integrated Area Management Action Plan (IAMAP), and submit it together with a management document which is described as integrating the CMP and the IAMAP to the World Heritage Centre by 1 September 2010 for review by the Advisory Bodies, \n b) Ensure that the integrated CMP and IAMAP acknowledge and reference the draft Statement of Outstanding Universal Value to be approved by the World Heritage Committee, \n c) Formally adopt the revised IAMAP in the urban planning system of the City of Baku, \n d) Extend and develop the design guidelines for the rehabilitation and restoration of historic buildings, and the design of new constructions and street furniture, already included in the IAMAP (and any other relevant instruments), in a published document for efficient use by the State Department of the Historical-Architectural Reserve "Icherisheher" and Icherisheher owners, \n e) Ensure that the overall management system in place gives priority to maintaining the Outstanding Universal Value for which the property was inscribed on the World Heritage List in all conservation, promotion and development actions which affect the property; \n 5.  Also requests  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre/ICOMOS reactive monitoring mission to the World Heritage property, to assist the State Party in following-up on progress made in responding to the above requests, and in defining measures in order to prevent any activities which could represent a potential threat on the Outstanding Universal Value, integrity and authenticity of the property; \n 6.  Further requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2012,  an updated report on the state of conservation of the property and progress made in the implementation of the abovementioned requests, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 36th session in 2012.
