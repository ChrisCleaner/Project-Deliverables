VII.58 Butrinti (Albania)  \n At the twentieth extraordinary session of the Bureau, the Secretariat reported that major studies were being undertaken for tourism development of the World Heritage site of Butrinti and that Albania had made a request for technical cooperation for monitoring these activities, which, in the meantime, was approved by the Chairperson of the Committee. The assistance, however, could not be implemented due to the non-payment of the contributions to the World Heritage Fund. \n The Bureau commended the Albanian authorities for their efforts at Butrinti, and recommended that the Director of the World Heritage Centre explore with the Albanian authorities a way of solving the current difficulties so that a monitoring mission may be enacted in the near future. The Bureau requested that the Committee be kept informed about the on-going activities. \n &nbsp;
