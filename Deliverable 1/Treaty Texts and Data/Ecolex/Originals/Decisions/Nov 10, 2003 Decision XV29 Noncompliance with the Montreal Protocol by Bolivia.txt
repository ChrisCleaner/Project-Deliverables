The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/29:      To note that, in accordance with decision XIV/20 of the Fourteenth Meeting of the Parties, Bolivia was requested to submit to the Implementation Committee a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance;   To note with appreciation Bolivia\xe2\x80\x99s submission of its plan of action, and to note further that under the plan, Bolivia specifically commits itself:     To reducing CFC consumption from 65.5 ODP-tonnes in 2002 as follows:     To 63.6 ODP-tonnes in 2003;   To 47.6 ODP-tonnes in 2004;   To 37.84 ODP-tonnes in 2005;   To 11.35 ODP-tonnes in 2007;   To phasing out CFC consumption by 1 January 2010, as required under the Montreal Protocol, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To monitoring its system for licensing imports and exports of ODS, including quotas, introduced in 2003;   To monitoring its ban on imports of ODS-using equipment, introduced in 1997 for CFC-12 and extended to other ODS in 2003;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 2 above have already enabled Bolivia to return to compliance, to congratulate Bolivia on that progress, and to urge Bolivia to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the remainder of the plan of action and phase out consumption of ozone-depleting substances in Annex A, group I;   To monitor closely the progress of Bolivia with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of CFCs. To the degree that Bolivia is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Bolivia should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Bolivia, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that it fails to remain in compliance the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of CFCs (that is, the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
