V.195&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau was informed that no substantive report on the state of conservation of the property was submitted by the State Party as requested at the twenty-fourth extraordinary session of the Bureau. However, the Bureau was informed that the Peruvian Government had suspended the cable car project, although final confirmation from the Government was still pending. \n V.196&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau stressed once again the need to implement the recommendations made by the UNESCO-IUCN-ICOMOS mission of 1999 that were fully endorsed by the Committee at its twenty-third session. It recognised that progress has been made on the implementation of some recommendations and welcomed, in particular, the decision of the Government of Peru to suspend the cable car project. This decision should, according to the Bureau, facilitate the undertaking of studies to define the carrying capacity of the site and develop a well-considered approach to the management of an ever-increasing flow of visitors. \n V.197&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau requested UNESCO-IUCN-ICOMOS to field a mission to the site in order to obtain a clear view of the level of implementation of all the recommendations of the 1999 mission. The mission should also look into (a) the policy for the use of the site for commercial purposes, (b) the restoration of the Intihuantana sundial, and (c) the research that is being or is to be undertaken on the landslide risks. The report of the mission should be submitted to the twenty-sixth session of the Bureau.
