Dinosaur Provincial Park (Canada)  \n The Committee noted that IUCN agreed, in principle, to deleting 1,415 acres of privately owned land comprising natural gas deposits from this site and including 1,478 acres of higher geological value as compensation. The Committee noted that the technology used to drill gas wells had low impacts but pointed out that it would be concerned if the drilling extends to sites within the World Heritage property. The Canadian Delegate informed the Committee that the maps of the area clearly showed that the sites which will be drilled are outside the Park boundaries. The Committee requested that IUCN evaluate the maps recently submitted by Canada, showing the locations of the drilling sites. \n &nbsp;
