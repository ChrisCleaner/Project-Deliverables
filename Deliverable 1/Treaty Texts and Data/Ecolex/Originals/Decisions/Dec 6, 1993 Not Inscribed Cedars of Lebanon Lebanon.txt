Cedars of Lebanon  \n  646  \n  Lebanon  \n The Committee recognized the sacred importance of the Cedars of Lebanon. However, the nominated site is too small to retain its integrity and therefore the Committee was of the view that it did not meet natural World Heritage criteria. The Delegate of Lebanon informed the Committee that steps were being undertaken for the preparation for a future nomination of a cultural landscape being considered for the Qadisha Valley, including one Grove of the Lebanese Cedars. \n &nbsp;
