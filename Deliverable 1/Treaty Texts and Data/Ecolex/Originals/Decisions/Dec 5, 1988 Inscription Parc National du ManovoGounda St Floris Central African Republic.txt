Parc National du Manovo-Gounda St. Floris   \n  475   \n  Central African Republic  \n  N(ii)(iv)  \n The Committee welcomed the telex dated 24 November 1988 from the Minister of Water and Forestry of the Central African Republic which gave assurances as to the States Party\'s full commitment to improve the conditions of integrity of this property, notably concerning poaching and illegal grazing. The Committee decided to inscribe this property on the World Heritage List and wished to encourage the Central African Republic in these protective efforts. The Committee expressed the wish that the recently launched 10-year project financed by EEC/FED at a cost of US$27 million would show positive results very soon. The Committee requested IUCN to work with the Central African authorities to monitor very closely the state of conservation of this property, particularly as to how it still met natural criteria (ii) and (iv), and to report back to the Bureau and the Committee as soon as possible. \n The representatives of Canada and the United States clearly recognized the potential of this site and applauded the commitment of the Central African Republic but noted the severe damage to the Park\'s integrity due to poaching and illegal grazing. In consequence, these two Member States expressed a reservation about the timing of the inscription of this site on the World Heritage List. \n &nbsp;
