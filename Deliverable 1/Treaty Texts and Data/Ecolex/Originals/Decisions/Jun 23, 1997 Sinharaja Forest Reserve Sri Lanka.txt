The Bureau was informed that the Sri Lankan authorities have increased the total area of the Sinharaja National Heritage Wilderness Area from 8,860 ha to 11,187 ha to incorporate some habitat fragments northeast of the World Heritage Area. Since the current size of the Sinharaja World Heritage area is 8,860 ha, the Bureau requested IUCN and the Centre to contact Sri Lankan authorities to obtain information on areas included in the extension in order to determine whether or not the State Party should be invited to consider increasing the total area of the World Heritage Site.
