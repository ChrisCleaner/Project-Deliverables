The World Heritage Committee,   1.  Having examined  Documents  WHC-06/30.COM/8B  and  WHC-06/30.COM/INF.8B.1 ,   2.  Inscribes  the  Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape, United Kingdom , on the World Heritage List on the basis of criteria (ii), (iii) and (iv):    Criterion (ii):  The development of industrialised mining in Cornwall and West Devon between 1700 and 1914, and particularly the innovative use of the beam engine, led to the evolution of an industrialised society manifest in the transformation of the landscape through the creation of new towns and villages, smallholdings, railways, canals, docks and ports, and this had a profound impact on the growth of industrialisation in the United Kingdom and then on industrialised mining around the world.    Criterion (iii):  The extent and scope of the remains of copper and tin mining, and the associated transformation of the urban and rural landscapes, including the now distinctive plant communities of waste and spoil heaps and estuarine areas, presents a vivid and legible testimony to the success of Cornish and West Devon industrialised mining when the area dominated the world\'s output of copper, tin and arsenic.    Criterion (iv):  The mining landscape of Cornwall and West Devon, and particularly its characteristic engine houses and beam engines, as a technological ensemble in a landscape, reflect the substantial contribution the area made to the industrial revolution and formative changes in mining practices around the world.   3.  Notes  the statement of the State Party specifying that, according to paragraph 106 of the  Operational Guidelines  (2005), a further buffer zone is not required due to the comprehensive mechanism of conservation which shall protect the  Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape  from large scale development that might impinge on its integrity and value;   4.  Requests  that any proposals concerning the re-opening of mines in the nominated areas be forwarded to the World Heritage Committee for debate and scrutiny;   5.  Also requests  that the natural values of the cultural landscape should be fully integrated into the future management of the site in a way that demonstrates the link between biodiversity and landscape protection and that policies should be developed for biodiversity, the protection of natural landscapes, contamination control and for the protection of distinctive habitats and plant communities related to mining.
