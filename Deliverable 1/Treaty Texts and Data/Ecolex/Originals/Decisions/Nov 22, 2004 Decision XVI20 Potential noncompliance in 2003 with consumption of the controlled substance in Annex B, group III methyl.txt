The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/20:      To note that the following Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol have reported annual data for the controlled substance in Annex B, group III (methyl chloroform), for 2003 which is above their requirement for a freeze in consumption: Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador and the Islamic Republic of Iran. In the absence of further clarification, those Parties are presumed to be in non-compliance with the control measures under the Protocol. To note, however, that the Islamic Republic of Iran has submitted a request for a change in its baseline data for methyl chloroform that will be considered by the Implementation Committee at its next meeting;   To request those Parties, as a matter of urgency, to submit to the Implementation Committee for consideration at its next meeting explanations for their excess consumption, together with plans of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance. Those Parties may wish to consider including in their plans of action the establishment of import quotas to freeze imports at baseline levels and support the phase-out schedule, and policy and regulatory instruments that will ensure progress in achieving the phase-out;   To monitor closely the progress of those Parties with regard to the phase-out of methyl chloroform. To the degree that those Parties are working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, they should continue to be treated in the same manner as Parties in good standing. In that regard, those Parties should continue to receive international assistance to enable them to meet their commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Meeting of the Parties cautions those Parties, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that any Party fails to return to compliance in a timely manner, the Meeting of the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of methyl chloroform (that is, the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
