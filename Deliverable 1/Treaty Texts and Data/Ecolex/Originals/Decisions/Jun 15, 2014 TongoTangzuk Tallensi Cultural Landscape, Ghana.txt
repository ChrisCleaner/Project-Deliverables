The World Heritage Committee, \n \n  Having examined  Documents WHC-14/38.COM/8B and WHC-14/38.COM/INF.8B1, \n  Defers  the examination of the nomination of  Tongo-Tangzuk Tallensi Cultural Landscape, Ghana , to the World Heritage List in order to allow the State Party to:\n \n develop, through survey and research, a database of the overall Tallensi cultural landscape and its context in order to allow a fuller understanding of its distinctiveness, structures and challenges, \n provide adequate protection to defeat major threats, \n put in place management measures to provide a framework within which traditional practices and rituals associated with building, farming, and forestry practices can be supported and encouraged through an appropriate collaborative management system, \n enhance capacity building for local committees on earthen architecture which can begin to reverse the decline of the traditional buildings; \n \n \n  Considers  that such a new nomination would need to encompass a large enough area to provide a sustainable socio-economic unit that might be able to harness the benefits of cultural tourism and promote ways for farmers to add value to their local produce, and would need to cover all aspects of the cultural landscape, not just the shrines; \n  Also considers  that any new nomination would need to include an augmented comparative analysis; \n  Further considers  that any revised nomination would need to be considered by an expert mission to the site.
