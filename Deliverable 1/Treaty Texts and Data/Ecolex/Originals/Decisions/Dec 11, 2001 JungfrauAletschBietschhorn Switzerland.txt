Property:  Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn  \n Id. N&deg;:  1037  \n State Party:  Switzerland  \n Criteria:  N (i)(ii)(iii)  \n The Committee inscribed the Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn on the World Heritage List under criteria (i), (ii), and (iii): \n  Criterion (i):  The Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn region is the most glaciated area in the Alps and incorporates the Great Aletsch glacier, the largest and longest in western Eurasia. It is thus of significant scientific interest in the context of glacial history and ongoing processes, particularly related to climate change. \n  Criterion (ii):  The Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn region provides a wide range of alpine and sub-alpine habitats. Superb examples of ecological succession exist, including the distinctive upper and lower treeline of the Aletsch forest. The global phenomenon of climatic change is particularly well illustrated in the region, as reflected in the varying rates of retreat of the different glaciers, in turn providing new substrates for ongoing ecological succession. \n  Criterion (iii):  The impressive landscape of the Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn region has played an important role in European literature, art, mountaineering and alpine tourism. The aesthetics of the area have attracted an international clientele and it is globally recognised as one of the most spectacular mountain regions to visit. \n &nbsp;
