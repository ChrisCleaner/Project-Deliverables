Old Town of Avila (Spain)  \n In October 1993 the Centre was informed of a project to construct a new bridge over the river Rio Adajo just outside the historic walls of the city and close to the Roman bridge. ICOMOS reported that the bridge would directly affect the view on the city. The Spanish Delegation informed the Committee that complementary information from the municipal authorities was expected and that as soon as this was available, the Centre would receive a report in this respect. The Committee expressed its concern on this matter and requested the Centre to inform the municipal authorities, and ask them to study other possibilities of solving the traffic flow. \n &nbsp;
