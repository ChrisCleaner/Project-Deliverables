The  First Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. I/10  to request the Panel for Scientific Assessment to give full consideration to ODPs, greenhouse-warming potential and atmospheric life-time of the various atmospheric constituents whether controlled or not, and advise the Parties as to the environmental characteristics, both currently and in the light of projections of future production and emission, of all relevant atmospheric constituents. In this regard, particular attention should be paid to potential substitutes for the presently controlled substances, particularly HCFC-22. Similarly, the importance of methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride in controlling the volume of atmospheric ozone should be quantified.
