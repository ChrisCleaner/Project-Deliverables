Portobelo-San Lorenzo (Panama)  \n The state of conservation of the site had beens studied by an expert mission in 1993. The mission concluded that the Fortress of San Lorenzo was in an acceptable state of conservation, although stone conservation requires some special attention. The city of Portobelo is under pressure from increased population and deficient infrastructure. An action plan was drawn up for the execution of the necessary archaeological survey before construction works are undertaken in the town. Underwater excavations should not be considered as a priority. \n &nbsp;
