The World Heritage Committee, \n \n \n  Having examined  Document WHC-15/39.COM/7A, \n \n \n  Recalling  Decisions  38 COM 7A.37  and  38 COM 7A.42 ,\xc2\xa0adopted at its 38th session (Doha, 2014), \n \n \n  Notes with appreciation  the continued efforts deployed by the park staff to continue to ensure the conservation of the property despite life threatening conditions, and\xc2\xa0 expresses  its most sincere condolences\xc2\xa0to the families of the guards killed in operations for the protection of the property; \n \n \n  Welcomes  the improvement of the security situation and the fact that park surveillance coverage has increased to 75% and that all critical areas for large mammals are under control of the park management; \n \n \n  Reiterates its significant concern  about the fact that the State Party has not cancelled the petroleum licenses in the Park, as requested in its previous decisions, and  strongly urges  the State Party to cancel all the oil exploitation permits granted within the property without further delay and to make a clear commitment not to authorize further oil exploration or oil exploitation within the established boundaries of the property as it was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1979; \n \n \n  Also reiterates its position  that oil, gas and mineral exploration or exploitation are incompatible with World Heritage status; \n \n \n  Notes with concern  that the Prime Minister in its letter dated 26 January 2015, while affirming that the Government so far has not approved oil exploitation in Virunga National Park, acknowledges that the State Party might seek a minor boundary modification to enable exploitation to go ahead; \n \n \n  Further reiterates its position  that oil exploration or exploitation is incompatible with World Heritage status, which is supported by the commitments made by industry leaders such as Shell and Total not to undertake such activities within World Heritage properties and  underlines  that modifications to boundaries of World Heritage properties that are related to extractive industry should be dealt with through the procedure for significant modifications of boundaries, in accordance with Paragraph 165 of the  Operational Guidelines  given the potential impact of such projects on the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV); \n \n \n  Recalls  that the Statement of OUV of the property refers on several occasions to the importance of Lake Edward and its floodplains for its OUV and therefore,  considers  that removing this area from the property would have a significant negative impact on its OUV; \n \n \n  Expresses its continued concern  about the serious threats to the OUV of the property, in particular the encroachment of close to 10% of its surface by illegal settlements and uncontrolled agriculture and the limited support park staff is receiving from the Government to address these threats, and\xc2\xa0 further reiterates its request \xc2\xa0to the State Party to implement the commitments made by the Congolese Government in the Kinshasa Declaration of January 2011; \n \n \n  Encourages  the work of the Virunga Alliance, which aims to support sustainable economic development around the park, and  also encourages  private, bilateral and multilateral donors to support this initiative; \n \n \n  Also urges  the State Party to expedite implementation of the corrective measures, as updated by the 2014 joint World Heritage Centre / IUCN Reactive Monitoring mission; \n \n \n  Requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2016 , an updated report, including a 1-page executive summary, on the state of conservation of the property and the implementation of the above, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 40th session in 2016; \n \n \n  Decides  to continue the application of the Reinforced Monitoring Mechanism of the property; \n \n \n   Also decides    to retain the Virunga National Park (Democratic Republic of the Congo) on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
