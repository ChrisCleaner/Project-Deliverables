The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Expresses  strong concern regarding the potential impacts of the proposed development and the lack of a comprehensive environmental assessment, in particular noting the potential impacts for hydrocarbon and chemical spills from this type of development and the gaps in hydrogeological information;  2.  Urges  that a research programme be conducted to include analysis of alternative site options and a detailed structural geologic and hydro-geologic study with a study of water flow patterns in a range of climatic conditions between the Graham Springs Basin and Mammoth Cave Basin in order to determine the risk to the World Heritage site; 3.  Requests  that the State Party keep the Committee informed of progress with the Inter-modal Transportation Authority (ITA) report  Site Evaluation and Design Assistance for the Proposed Kentucky Trimodal Transpark,  the progress of research and the status of the Transpark project.
