The  First Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. I/12G  to agree to the following clarification of Article 2, paragraph 6 of the Protocol:     paragraphs 1 to 4 of Article 2 of the Protocol freeze and then reduce annual production and therefore do not allow any increase of such production under Article 2, paragraph 6;   since the object and purpose of the Protocol is to significantly reduce the production and use of CFCs and halons, neither Article 2, paragraph 6 nor any other provision allows an increase in production to be exported to non-Parties so that the reduction in global consumption is not obtained in accordance with the object of the Protocol;   only countries that notify the Secretariat that the facilities were under construction or contracted prior to 16 September 1987, provided for in national legislation prior to 1 January 1987 and completed by 31 December 1990 were allowed to operate under Article 2, paragraph 6.
