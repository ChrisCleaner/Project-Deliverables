The  Tenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. X/1:      To note with satisfaction the large number of countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer;   To note that many Parties have yet to ratify the London, Copenhagen and Montreal Amendments to the Montreal Protocol;   To urge all States that have not yet done so to ratify, approve or accede to the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments, taking into account that universal participation is necessary to ensure the protection of the ozone layer.
