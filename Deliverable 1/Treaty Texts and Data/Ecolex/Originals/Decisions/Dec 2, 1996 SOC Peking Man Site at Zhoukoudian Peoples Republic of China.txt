VII.47 Peking Man Site at Zhoukoudian (People\'s Republic of China)  \n A UNESCO mission, undertaken in September 1996, revealed a number of major problems, including the complete halt of site excavations, lack of adequate maintenance of the site and the lack of a new generation of researchers. \n The Committee took note of the report provided by the Director of the UNESCO Division for Cultural Heritage who attended the first international Technical Committee on the Peking Man Site from 25 to 27 November 1996. The Technical Committee recommended enhancement in the protection of the site, especially the Upper Cave, improvement of the site museum and research facilities as well as to further scientific research. \n &nbsp;
