VII.45 Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu (Peru)  \n The Secretariat recalled the suggestion of the Bureau at its twentieth session that alternative means of access to Machu Picchu should be studied in the context of integral planning for the whole of the area of the Sanctuary and that an assessment of the impact of a possible cable car system be undertaken, and the Bureau\'s request that the authorities of Peru inform the Committee on the progress made in the development of an integral management mechanism as well as on the plans for the access to the ruins of Machu Picchu. No response was received by the Secretariat since then, however, it was informed that tenders had been invited for the cable car system. \n The Committee considered that the implementation of the cable car system could have a serious impact on the World Heritage site and that no action should be undertaken until a proper management plan is in force. Therefore, the Committee urged the Peruvian authorities to develop integral management mechanisms for the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu and suggested that alternative means of access to Machu Picchu be studied in the context of integral planning for the whole of the area of the Sanctuary and that an assessment of its impact be undertaken. The Committee requested the Peruvian authorities to provide a full report on the state of conservation and the management mechanisms of Machu Picchu by 15 April 1997 for examination by the Bureau at its twenty-first session. \n &nbsp;
