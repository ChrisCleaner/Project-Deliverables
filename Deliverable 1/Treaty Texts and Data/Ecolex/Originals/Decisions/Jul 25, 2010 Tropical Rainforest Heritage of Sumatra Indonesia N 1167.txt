The World Heritage Committee; \n 1.&nbsp; Having examined  Document WHC-10/34.COM/7B, \n 2.&nbsp; Recalling  Decision  33 COM 7B.15 , adopted at its 33rd session (Seville, 2009), \n 3.&nbsp; Notes with utmost concern  that the property continues to face intense pressure from illegal activities, including road construction, encroachment, logging, poaching and mining prospecting, which are a major threat to its Outstanding Universal Value, including the conditions for integrity, and represent both an ascertained and potential danger in relation to the provisions of Paragraph 180 of the  Operational Guidelines , as confirmed by three monitoring missions since 2004; \n 4.&nbsp; Also notes  that since the time of inscription, the World Heritage Committee has been advised to place the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger as a result of continuing and aggravated threats to its values and integrity; \n 5.&nbsp; Requests  the State Party to implement the following corrective measures: \n a) Immediately halt all road construction plans within Kerinci Seblat National Park (KSNP), clarify in law that no roads shall be built through the parks comprising the property, close all existing illegal roads, and develop appropriate regulations and infrastructure on existing legal public roads to reduce the negative impacts of traffic on wildlife and to ensure ecological connectivity, \n b) Establish a clear institutional coordination mechanism to ensure that the large number of Emergency Action Plan (EAP) activities that are not within the park\'s mandate, and which are beyond its legal competence, including many of the activities intended to address encroachment, illegal logging and poaching, are successfully implemented through a cross-sectoral approach, and with the participation of all stakeholders, \n c) Develop and implement an effective and prioritized monitoring system to assess the status and trends of key factors affecting the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, including encroachment, illegal logging, poaching, wildlife trade, invasive species, and any anticipated climate change impacts in all components of the property, \n d) Provide law enforcement agencies with adequate resources to expand their law enforcement activities with regards to illegal activities affecting the property, including encroachment, logging, poaching, and the wildlife trade, \n e) Halt the establishment of new provinces, districts and sub-districts in the property in order to reduce both the administrative complexity of the property\'s management and the multiple development threats, \n f) Establish through law an appropriate buffer zone to secure the conservation of the property, \n g) Develop and implement an ecosystem-based restoration plan of the degraded forests in the property and neighbouring landscapes, \n 6.&nbsp; Also requests  the State Party, in consultation with the World Heritage Centre and IUCN, to develop a Statement of Outstanding Universal Value for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 35 session in 2011; \n 7.&nbsp; Strongly encourages  the State Party to consider alternative approaches to addressing the multiple threats affecting the property by making explicit provision within their Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradiations (REDD) national strategy, and specifically the Forest Investment Programme (FIP), for prioritizing the conservation of the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra forest ecosystem, and notes IUCN\'s willingness to assist the State Party in designing an effective programme for the property; \n 8.&nbsp; Reiterates its position  that mining is incompatible with World Heritage status, in line with the International policy statement of the International Council of Minerals and Metals (ICMM) of not undertaking these activities in World Heritage properties, and  urges  the State Party to ensure that the Department of Mining formally consults the management authorities of all of the different Protected Areas that form the components of the property (Kerinci Seblat National Park (KSNP), Gunung Leuser National Park (GLNP), and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP)) in the event of mining exploration in areas within or adjacent to the World Heritage property; \n 9.&nbsp; Invites  the State Party to submit an International Assistance request to provide support for the Emergency Action Plan workshop planned for 2010;&nbsp; \n 10.&nbsp; Requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2011 , a report, including periodic satellite imagery over the period 2006-2010, which demonstrates that concerns raised in previous monitoring missions such as illegal logging, agricultural encroachment, mining and illegal road construction, have ceased impacting the Outstanding Universal Value of the property; \n 11.&nbsp; Requests furthermore  the State Party to invite a joint World Heritage Centre/IUCN reactive monitoring mission to the property in 2011 to evaluate the implementation of the recommendations of the 2009 mission and the progression of the threats, notably the logging and illegal activities including poaching, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 35th session in 2011,  with a view, in the absence of substantial progress, to considering the possible inscription of the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
