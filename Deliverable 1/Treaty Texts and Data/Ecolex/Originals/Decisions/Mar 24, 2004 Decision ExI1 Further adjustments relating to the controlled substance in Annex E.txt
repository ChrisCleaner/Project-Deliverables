The  First Extraordinary Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. Ex.I/1:     Recalling  that, according to subparagraph 1 (e) of decision IX/5, the Meeting of the Parties should have decided in 2003 on further specific interim reductions on methyl bromide for the period beyond 2005 applicable to Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5,    Taking into account  that current circumstances prevent several Article 5 Parties from adopting a decision in that regard,    Noting  that, by 1 February 2006, non-Article 5 Parties will submit national management strategies which will send a clear signal on the phase-out of critical uses of methyl bromide;    Considering  that at the Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties the Parties will decide on the level of replenishment of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol for the triennium 2006-2008, which should take into account the requirement to provide new and additional adequate financial and technical assistance to enable Article 5 Parties to comply with further interim reductions on methyl bromide,     To keep under review the interim reduction schedule as elaborated during the Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties;   To consider, preferably by 2006, further specific interim reductions in methyl bromide applicable to Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5.
