Property:  Discovery   Coast Atlantic Forest   Reserves  \n Id. N&deg;:  892Rev  \n State Party:  Brazil  \n Criteria:  N (ii) (iv)  \n IUCN informed the Committee that the evaluation of this property has been undertaken based on the revised nomination submitted by the State Party in April 1999. \n The Brazilian Discovery Coast includes eight separate protected areas containing the best and largest remaining examples of Atlantic forest in the Northeast region of Brazil and contains high numbers of rare and endemic species. The site displays the biological richness and evolutionary history of the few remaining areas of Atlantic forest of Northeast Brazil. The site reveals a pattern of evolution of great interest to science and importance for conservation. The fact that only these few scattered remnants of a once vast forest remain, make them an irreplaceable part of the world\'s forest heritage. \n The Committee decided to inscribe the site under natural  criteria (ii)  and  (iv) . It also recommended that the State Party should be encouraged to complete the "Plan of Action for the Atlantic Forest Region" and other initiatives indicated in the IUCN evaluation.
