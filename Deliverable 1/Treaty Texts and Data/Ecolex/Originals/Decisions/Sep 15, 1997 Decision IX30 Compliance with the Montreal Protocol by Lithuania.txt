The  Ninth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. IX/30:      To note the timetable for the ratification of the London Amendment to the Montreal Protocol provided by Lithuania and urge Lithuania to ratify the London Amendment in September 1997 as indicated in their timetable;   To note that, according to the information contained in Lithuania\xe2\x80\x99s country programme for the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances, Lithuania is in a situation of non-compliance with the Montreal Protocol in 1997 and there is a possibility of non-compliance in 1998, so that the Implementation Committee might have to revert to that question that year;   To recommend that, in light of the country\xe2\x80\x99s commitment reflected in the country programme, and related official communications of Lithuania to the Parties in line with decision VIII/23, international assistance, particularly by GEF, should be considered favourably in order to provide funding to Lithuania for projects to implement the country programme for phasing out ozone-depleting substances in the country;   To keep under review the situation with regard to ODS phase-out in Lithuania.
