The Bureau took note with satisfaction of the safeguarding activities undertaken by UNESCO for Cambodian heritage. The Organization had already started this work before the signature of the peace treaty. Since then, Cambodia has adhered to the Convention and the Bureau considered it to be its duty to participate actively in the restoration and conservation of Angkor. \n A member of the Bureau underlined the fact that the inscription of this site on the World Heritage List was a matter of genuine urgency. In fact, following the war which devastated this country, the protection of the site could no longer be guaranteed. A management plan for the site has to be elaborated, legislation revised and the necessary personnel for the protection and restoration of the site have to be trained. UNESCO is participating in the elaboration of a management plan in collaboration with UNDP, Sweden and France. Furthermore, a legal expert will shortly be sent by the World Heritage Centre to advise Cambodian jurists. Finally, restoration specialists will be trained with the assistance of Japanese funds. \n Following the request of the Cambodian authorities regarding the preparation of a dossier to nominate the site of Angkor on the World Heritage List, a contract will be established with the Ecole francaise d\'Extreme Orient under preparatory assistance. The Bureau requested ICOMOS to evaluate this nomination for inscription and recommend that the Committee consider favourably the possibility of initiating the procedure for inscription.
