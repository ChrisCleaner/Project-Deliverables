The amount was increased from US$ 70,000 to US$ 80,000.The amount proposed for co-ordination with other Conventions and programmes, etc. was approved. The Centre will make a report on the use of this amount at the Bureau meeting to be held in June 1998 which will decide upon its future use. An amount of US$ 50,000 was approved for the work of the Consultative Body. Zimbabwe and South Africa expressed their wish to participate in the work of this Body. The budget for Chapter I amounted to US$ 160,000. \n  XI.7.2 Chapter II   At the request of the advisory bodies and with the support of several delegates:- contribution to ICOMOS for the implementation of the Convention concerning advisory services and Global Strategy financed by the World Heritage Fund, will be included in a single contract amounting to US$ 350,000 (including US$ 23,000 for thematic studies);-a special budget line grouping the different activities of ICCROM will be established under this Chapter. The amount proposed for this Chapter including the above-mentioned changes was approved. \n  XI.7.3 Chapter III   The substantial increase foreseen for this Chapter will be brought to the attention of all UNESCO Member States as a means to raise interest and encourage them to ratify the Convention. The non-earmarked resources amounting to US$ 200,000 (of which US$ 10,000 has been used for increases decided upon in Chapter I for participation in statutory meetings and US$25,000 has been used for the radio programmes) is evenly divided between technical cooperation and training. Support for promotional activities at sites is increased by US$ 25,000 already approved for radio programmes. This new amount will be used to support, at the request of States Parties, for promotional activities in the States for radio as well as other media. The amounts foreseen in the Chapter for the advisory bodies are to be indicated. The budget for Chapter III amounts to US$ 2,440,000. \n  XI.7.4 Chapter IV   To respond better to the needs of States and to improve implementation, certain flexibility was agreed concerning the allocation of funds between the regions. The amount proposed for this Chapter was approved without any changes. The training component for ICCROM is clearly indicated in Chapter III. \n  XI.7.5 Chapter V   As this Chapter had already been discussed and approved earlier, it remains unchanged. \n  XI.7.6 Emergency Reserve   The Committee decided that the emergency reserve fund should be replenished to US$500,000 as of 1 January 1998. \n &nbsp; \n  Approved Budget for 1998 and Tentative Budget for 1999 (in United States Dollars)  \n \n \n \n \n  Chapter and Component   \n \n \n  1998   \n \n \n  1999   \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n  Chapter I - Overall Functioning of the WH Convention   \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Attendance of Experts in Statutory Meetings Review of the Management  Coordination with other Conventions and Programmes \n \n \n 80,000  50,000  30,000 \n \n \n 80,000 0 30,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Sub-Total Chapter I \n \n \n 160,000 \n \n \n 110,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n  Chapter II - Establishment of the World Heritage List   \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Global Strategy (*) \n \n \n 243,000 \n \n \n 100,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Advisory Services  a) ICOMOS  b) IUCN  c) ICCROM  d) Other Institutions and Individuals \n \n \n &nbsp; 327,000  237,750  p.m.  40,000 \n \n \n &nbsp; 330,000 240,000 p.m. 50,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Sub-Total Advisory Services \n \n \n 604,750 \n \n \n 620,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Sub-Total Chapter II \n \n \n 847,750 \n \n \n 720,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n  Chapter III - Technical Implementation of the World Heritage Convention   \n \n \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; 300,000 1,032,500 982,500  125,000 \n \n \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; 300,000 1032,500  982,500  125,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Preparatory Assistance Technical Assistance  Training (**)  Support to Promotional Activities in the Sites \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Sub-Total Chapter III \n \n \n 2,440,000 \n \n \n 2,440,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n  Chapter IV - Monitoring the State of Conservation of the Sites   \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Reactive Monitoring (***)  Establishment of a Format  Support to States Parties for Periodic Monitoring  a) Methodological Development  b) Africa c) Arab States d) Asia and Pacific  e) Europe  f) Latin American &amp; the Caribbean \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n 120,000 0 \n 25,000  65,000  35,000  45,000  25,000  45,000 \n \n \n 150,000 0 \n 000  75,000  45,000  55,000  35,000  55,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Sub-Total Periodic Monitoring \n \n \n 240,000 \n \n \n 265,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Sub-Total Chapter IV \n \n \n 360,000 \n \n \n 415,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n  Chapter V - Documemtation, Information and Education   \n \n \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; 38,000  165,000  70,000  10,000  226,333  70,000 \n \n \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; 50,000 180,000 85,000  10,000 156,000 80,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Documentation Information Material  Internet and WHIN  Media and Publishers  Services affected to Promotonal  Activities Education \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Sub-Total Chapter V \n \n \n 579,333 \n \n \n 561,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Grand Total World Heritage Fund \n \n \n 4,387,083 \n \n \n 4,246,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n Chapter VI - Emergency Reserve Fund \n \n \n 500,000 \n \n \n 500,000 \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n (*) of which US$ 30,000 for IUCN &amp; US$ 23,000 for ICOMOS (**) includes contract of ICCROM &amp; US$ 32,400 for IUCN (***) of which US$ 40,000 for each of ICOMOS &amp; IUCN \n &nbsp;
