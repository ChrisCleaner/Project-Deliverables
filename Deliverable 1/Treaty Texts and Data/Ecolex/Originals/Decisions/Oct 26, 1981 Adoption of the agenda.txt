7. The Committee adopted the agenda for the session. \n 8. A delegate suggested that two working groups be set up in order to examine a number of questions of principle relating to the implementation of the Convention, and, in particular, the procedures for the evaluation of nominated properties and the way to strike a better balance between the cultural heritage and the natural heritage. \n 9. The Chairman suggested that this proposal be examined by the Bureau as soon as it was established. It was subsequently decided to set up two working groups, one to study the procedure for the evaluation and examination of nominations to the World Heritage List as well as the question of protecting world heritage properties and another to examine technical co-operation requests and to propose a budget for the forthcoming year. \n &nbsp;
