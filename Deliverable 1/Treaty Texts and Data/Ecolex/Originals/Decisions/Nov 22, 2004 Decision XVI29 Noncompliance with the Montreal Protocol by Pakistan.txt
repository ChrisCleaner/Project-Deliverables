The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/29:      To note that Pakistan ratified the Montreal Protocol and the London Amendment on 18 December 1992 and the Copenhagen Amendment on 17 February 1995. Pakistan is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee in 1996. The Executive Committee has approved $18,492,150 from the Multilateral Fund to enable compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;   To note that, in accordance with decision XV/22 of the Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties, Pakistan was requested to submit to the Implementation Committee a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance;   To note with appreciation Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s submission of its plan of action, and to note also that, under the plan, Pakistan specifically commits itself:     To reducing halon consumption from 15.0 ODP tonnes in 2003 as follows:     To 14.2 ODP tonnes in 2004;   To 7.1 ODP tonnes in 2005;   To phasing out halon consumption by 2010, as required under the Montreal Protocol, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To monitor its enhanced system for licensing imports and exports of ozone-depleting substances, including quotas, introduced in 2004;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 3 above should enable Pakistan to return to compliance by 2004, and to urge Pakistan to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase out consumption of ozone-depleting substances in Annex A, group II (halons);   To monitor closely the progress of Pakistan with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of halons. To the degree that Pakistan is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Pakistan should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Meeting of the Parties cautions Pakistan, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that it fails to remain in compliance, the Meeting of the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of halon (that is, the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
