The World Heritage Committee,   1.  Having examined  Documents  WHC-06/30.COM/8B  and  WHC-06/30.COM/INF.8B.1 ,   2.  Inscribes  the  Crac des Chevaliers and Qal\'at Salah El-Din, Syrian Arab Republic , on the World Heritage List on the basis of criteria (ii) and (iv):    Criterion (ii):  The crusader castles represent a significant development in the fortification systems, which substantially deferred from the European rather more passive defense systems, and which also contributed to the development of the castles in the Levant. Within the castles that have survived in the Near East from the Crusader period, the nominated properties represent the most significant examples illustrating the exchange of influences and documenting the evolution in this field, which had an impact both in the east and in the west.    Criterion (iv):  In the history of architecture, Crac des Chevaliers is taken as the best preserved example of the castles of the crusader period, and it is also seen as an archetype of a medieval castle particularly in the context of the military orders. Similarly, the Fortress of Saladin, even though partly in ruins, still represents an outstanding example of this type of fortification, both in terms of its quality of construction and the survival of its historical stratigraphy.   3.  Invites  the State Party to report back to the World Heritage Centre by  1 February 2007  on the implementation of the new management system and initiatives regarding the clearance of illegal structures and recommends that the State Party keep the World Heritage Committee informed about any changes that are planned within the nominated areas and their buffer zones;   4.  Notes  that the State Party has agreed to change the name of the nominated property from " Castles of Syria " into: " Crac des Chevaliers and Qal\'at Salah El-Din ".
