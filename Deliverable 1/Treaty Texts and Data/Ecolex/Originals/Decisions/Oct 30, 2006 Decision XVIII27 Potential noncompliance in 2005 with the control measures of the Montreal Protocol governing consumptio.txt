1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To note that the Islamic Republic of Iran ratified the Montreal Protocol on 3 October 1990, the London and Copenhagen Amendments on 4 August 1997 and the Montreal Amendment on 17\xc2\xa0October 2001, is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol in June 1993. The Executive Committee has approved $59,507,714 from the Multilateral Fund to enable the Party\xe2\x80\x99s compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;  2.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To note that the Islamic Republic of Iran has reported annual consumption for the controlled substance in Annex B, group II, (carbon tetrachloride) for 2005 of 13.640 ODP-tonnes, which exceeds the Party\xe2\x80\x99s maximum allowable consumption level of 11.550 ODP-tonnes for that controlled substance for that year, and that in the absence of further clarification the Islamic Republic of Iran is therefore presumed to be in non\xe2\x80\x91compliance with the control measures under the Protocol;  3.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To request the Islamic Republic of Iran to submit to the Secretariat, as a matter of urgency and no later than 31 March 2007, for consideration by the Implementation Committee under the Non-compliance Procedure of the Montreal Protocol at its next meeting, an explanation for its excess consumption, together with a plan of action with time\xe2\x80\x91specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance. The Islamic Republic of Iran may wish to consider including in its plan of action the establishment of import quotas to support the phase\xe2\x80\x91out schedule, a ban on imports of ozone\xe2\x80\x91depleting\xe2\x80\x91substance\xe2\x80\x91using equipment and policy and regulatory instruments that will ensure progress in achieving the phase-out;  4.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To monitor closely the progress of the Islamic Republic of Iran with regard to the phase\xe2\x80\x91out of carbon tetrachloride. To the degree that the Party is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, the Islamic Republic of Iran should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet its commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Meeting of the Parties cautions the Islamic Republic of Iran, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner, the Meeting of the Parties will consider measures consistent with item\xc2\xa0C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article\xc2\xa04, such as ensuring that the supply of carbon tetrachloride that is the subject of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance is ceased so that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non\xe2\x80\x91compliance;
