Niokolo-Koba National Park (Senegal)  \n The Committee recalled that there was a project to construct a major highway across the Park which would greatly jeopardize its natural values, and that the Bureau had expressed its preference for an alternative route outside the Park. On 1 August 1989, in accordance with the Bureau\'s recommendation, the Director-General of Unesco had written to the President of Senegal, His Excellency A. Diouf, informing him of the Bureau\'s preference for the alternative route. The Secretariat indicated to the Committee that, at a meeting held in Dakar on 14 November 1989, the Senegalese authorities had nevertheless stated their intention to proceed with the construction of the highway across the park. \n The World Bank had advised the Secretariat of its involvement in this project with associated bodies, through the preparation of a proposed programme for a Transport Sector Credit of which this project was part. The Bank had concluded, on the basis of the documents provided by Senegal, that the alternative route outside the park had not been sufficiently assessed. The Committee agreed with the Bank\'s proposal to carry out a more detailed study of the alternative route, which is presently being examined under a Bank appraisal mission in the field. \n The Committee requested the Secretariat to contact the Senegalese authorities to recall their responsibility in maintaining the integrity of this World Heritage site, stressing that the Committee offered its full co-operation in seeking a satisfactory solution to this issue which would safeguard the natural World Heritage values. The Committee also requested the Secretariat to contact the World Bank to inform it of the Committee\'s views. \n &nbsp;
