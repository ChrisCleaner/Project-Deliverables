At its thirteenth session, in December 1989, the Committee had expressed concern regarding the felling of trees in the park of Versailles Palace. The French observer informed the Bureau that, since that time, violent storms had devastated the park, bringing down more than 1,200 trees which, most fortunately, had not damaged in their fall any of the sculptures or buildings. The French observer added that the administration of both the park and the buildings at Versailles was now under the responsibility of a single department, which, together with all the other parties concerned, was giving serious thought to ways of repairing the damage and restoring the estate without spoiling the historical and aesthetic character of Versailles; the aim was to devise a management plan that would be satisfactory to all those concerned.
