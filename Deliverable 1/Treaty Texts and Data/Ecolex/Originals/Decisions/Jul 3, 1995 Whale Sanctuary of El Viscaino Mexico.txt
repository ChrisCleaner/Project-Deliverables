The Bureau took note of the oral report presented by IUCN on the site indicating that Mitsubishi Corporation in partnership with the Mexican Government has a project to convert a part of the lagoon to salt ponds for industrial salt production. A one-mile long pier is proposed, which would disturb the grey whales within the lagoon. The Bureau recommended that a letter be written to the authorities indicating the concerns raised at the nineteenth session of the Bureau and to request an official response on the situation at the site.
