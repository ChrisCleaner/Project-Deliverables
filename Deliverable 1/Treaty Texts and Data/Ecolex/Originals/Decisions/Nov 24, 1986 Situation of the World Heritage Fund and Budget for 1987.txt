41. In considering the budget for 1987, the Committee noted that the sum of approximately $ 2.7 million was available as cash in hand. This sum was considerably higher than in previous years due, in addition to the efforts noted above, to the fact that one State Party had resumed its signifi&shy;cant voluntary contributions to the Fund. In addition there had been some savings on the 1986 budget, in particular because the Secretariat had been insufficiently staffed to develop internatio&shy;nal assistance projects. In this connection, the Committee requested that in future working docu&shy;ments on the World Heritage Fund a clearer statement and more detailed information should be given on income and expenditure as well as on expenditure foreseen (funds already obligated and funds earmarked for approved project). Such information would be useful to enable States Parties to gain a better understanding of the use made of their contributions to the Fund and thus to provide any justification o f these contributions which might be necessary. \n 42. Given the more favorable budgetary situation, the Committee decided to increase all budget lines, with particular increases for technical cooperation and training, which are of direct benefit to States Parties, and for ICOMOS and IUCN, whose advisory services were particularly appreciated by the Committee and for temporary assistance to the Secretariat. The Committee also decided to keep approximately 15 % of the total amount available as a reserve to help balance the budget in less favourable years; it was understood that this reserve would remain intact in 1987. The Committee adopted the budget for 1987 as follows: \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; APPROVED BUDGET FOR 1987  \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n \n  Activity  \n \n \n  Funds approved  \n \n \n \n \n Preparatory assistance and regional studies \n \n \n 100,000 \n \n \n \n \n Technical cooperation \n \n \n 700,000 \n \n \n \n \n Training \n \n \n 500,000 \n \n \n \n \n Emergency assistance \n \n \n 230,000 \n \n \n \n \n Promotional activities, information, monitoring \n \n \n 142,000 \n \n \n \n \n Advisory services \n \n \n &nbsp;270,000 \n \n \n \n \n (IUCN 99,900) \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n (ICOMOS 170,100) \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n Temporary assistance to the Secretariat \n \n \n 250, 000* \n \n \n \n \n  SUB TOTAL  \n \n \n  2.192,000  \n \n \n \n \n 3% Contingency funds \n \n \n 67,760 \n \n \n \n \n  SUB TOTAL  \n \n \n  2.257, 760  \n \n \n \n \n Reserve (16,4 % Total) \n \n \n 442,240 \n \n \n \n \n  TOTAL  \n \n \n  2.700, 000  \n \n \n \n \n \n  * The Committee approved the establishment of the temporary posts listed in Annex II with these funds.  \n &nbsp;
