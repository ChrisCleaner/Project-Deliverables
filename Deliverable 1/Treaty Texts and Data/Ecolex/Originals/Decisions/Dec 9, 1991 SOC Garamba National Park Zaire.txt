Garamba   National Park (Zaire)  \n The Committee was glad to learn that the rhino population in this Park had increased to 31 and the local management capacity and budget have increased substantially. Poaching has also been brought under control. The Minister for Environment and Nature Protection of Zaire, by his letter of 26 February 1991, requested the removal of this site from the list of World Heritage in Danger. Although the Bureau at its last session in June 1991 recommended the removal of this site from the List of World Heritage in Danger, the Committee took note of the fact that in recent months civil order in the country had deteriorated. The Committee was in agreement with IUCN\'s observation that the rhino population was still small and continuous assistance and political stability are essential for maintaining the success achieved in the last five years. In view of the uncertainties associated with the recent civil unrest in Zaire, the Committee decided to defer taking a decision on the removal of this site from the List of World Heritage in Danger until its next session. \n &nbsp;
