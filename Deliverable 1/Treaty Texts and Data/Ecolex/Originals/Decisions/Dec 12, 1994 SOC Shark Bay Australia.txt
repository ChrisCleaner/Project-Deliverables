Shark   Bay (Australia)  \n The Committee recalled that at the time of inscription of this site it requested IUCN to report back on the progress with respect to  (1) implementation of the Commonwealth/State management agreement and  (2) efforts to achieve more effective conservation of the site. \n As the Government of Australia had assured that the October 1990 agreement was to provide the management framework for this site, the Committee was concerned that most of the provisions of the agreement have not been operationalised. Therefore, the Centre wrote to the Australian authorities requesting positive and concrete action, and was informed by the national authorities that a copy of the new agreement would be available by early December. A report from the Australian authorities is anticipated shortly. \n &nbsp;
