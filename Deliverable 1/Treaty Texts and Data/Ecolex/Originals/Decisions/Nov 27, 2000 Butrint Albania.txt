VIII.16 Butrint (Albania)  \n The Committee recalled that in October 1997, a joint UNESCO-ICOMOS-Butrint Foundation mission was undertaken to assess the damages caused to the site by civil unrest earlier that year. US$ 100,000 was made available as emergency assistance in 1997 to implement activities identified in the Programme of Corrective Actions, but to date, no report has been received on its implementation. \n The Committee reiterated its request to the State Party to submit a progress report by 15 April 2001 on the implementation of recommendations of the 1997 UNESCO-ICOMOS-Butrint Foundation Joint Mission, to enable the Bureau to examine this case at its twenty-fifth session. \n Noting the apparent difficulties in the implementation of the Programme of Corrective Actions, including those financed under the World Heritage Fund\'s Emergency Assistance, the Committee requested the Albanian authorities concerned to establish the administrative procedures necessary to enable the implementation of the Programme. \n The Committee requested UNESCO and ICOMOS to undertake a joint mission in early-2001 for an assessment of the current situation and to report to the twenty-fifth session of the Bureau. \n &nbsp;
