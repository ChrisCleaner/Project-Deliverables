The  Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVII/15:     Recalling  decision XVI/11, on coordination among United Nations bodies on quarantine and pre-shipment uses,    Acknowledging  the efforts made by the Ozone Secretariat to make contact and maintain coordination with the Secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention regarding reduction in the use of methyl bromide, with specific reference to standard 15 of the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures,    Bearing in mind  that the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures of the International Plant Protection Convention agreed to submit to the Standards Committee for expedited review proposals for amending the March 2002 standard 15, so as to increase the duration of exposure to methyl bromide during fumigation and increase the minimum required gas concentrations at various stages of the fumigation to ensure its efficacy, which are expected to be considered for adoption by the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in 2006,    Stressing  the importance of managing and, when economically and technically feasible, replacing quarantine and pre-shipment applications of methyl bromide,    Taking into account  the risk to the ozone layer of increasing methyl bromide emissions through quarantine and pre-shipment applications,     To request the Ozone Secretariat to further liaise with the secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention regarding the application of standard 15 of the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures;   To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to provide any information collected by the Quarantine and Pre-shipment Task Force pursuant to decision XVI/10 to the relevant bodies of the International Plant Protection Convention.
