The Bureau noted that the UNESCO Representative in Peru was in Cusco at the time of its session to discuss the modalities of the implementation of the World Heritage assistance for the preparation of a Master Plan. The Observer of Peru informed that with the new municipal administration, a joint commission will be set up for the preparation of a Master Plan. \n Considering this information, the Bureau decided to defer further examination to its twenty-third extraordinary session and requested the Peruvian authorities to submit a report in response to the request made by the Bureau at its twenty-second extraordinary session, by 15 September 1999.
