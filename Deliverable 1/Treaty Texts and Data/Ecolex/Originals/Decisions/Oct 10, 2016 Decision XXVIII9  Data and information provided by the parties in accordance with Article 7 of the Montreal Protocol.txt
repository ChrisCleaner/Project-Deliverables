1. To note that 195 parties of the 197 that should have reported data for 2015 have done so and that 169 of those parties reported their data by 30 September 2016 as required under paragraph 3 of Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol;   2. To note with appreciation that 119 of those parties reported their data by 30 June 2016 in accordance with decision XV/15 and that reporting by 30 June each year greatly facilitates the work of the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol in assisting parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol (Article 5 parties) to comply with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s control measures;   3. To note further that a lack of timely data reporting by parties impedes the effective monitoring and assessment of parties\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with their obligations under the Montreal Protocol;   4. To note with concern that two parties, namely, Iceland and Yemen, have not reported their 2015 data as required under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol and that this places them in non\xe2\x80\x91compliance with their data reporting obligations under the Montreal Protocol until such time as the Secretariat receives their outstanding data;   5. To urge the parties listed in the preceding paragraph to report the required data to the Secretariat as quickly as possible and to urge the one Article 5 party, namely, Yemen, where appropriate, to work closely with the implementing agencies in reporting the required data;   6. To request the Implementation Committee to review the situation of the parties listed in the preceding paragraphs at its fifty-eighth meeting;   7. To encourage parties to continue to report consumption and production data as soon as figures are available, and preferably by 30 June each year, as agreed in decision XV/15;
