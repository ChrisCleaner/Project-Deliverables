The  Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVI/26:      To note that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has reported annual data for the controlled substances in Annex A, group II (halons), for 2003 which is above its requirements for those substances. As a consequence, for 2003, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2B of the Montreal Protocol;   To request the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, as a matter of urgency, to submit a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya may wish to consider including in its plan of action the establishment of import quotas to freeze imports at baseline levels and support the phase-out schedule, a ban on the import of ozone-depleting-substances-using equipment, and policy and regulatory instruments that will ensure progress in achieving the phase-out;   To monitor closely the progress of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya with regard to the phase-out of halons. To the degree that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet its commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Meeting of the Parties cautions the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that, in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner, the Meeting of the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of halons (that is, the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
