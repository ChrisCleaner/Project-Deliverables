The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.&nbsp; Having examined  Document WHC-10/34.COM/7B.Add, \n 2.&nbsp; Recalling  Decision  33 COM 7B.39  ,    adopted at its 33rd (Seville, 2009),    \n 3.&nbsp; Notes with concern  that despite the World Heritage Committee\'s request for a moratorium on development, the State Party has continued to approve major development applications; \n 4.&nbsp; Reiterates its request  for the State Party to urgently place a moratorium on the creation of new lots and on the construction of all new residential and hotel development until such a time as new effective regulations are in place to determine if and where such developments could be permitted; \n 5.&nbsp; Strongly urges  the State Party to immediately revise both the "Specific Guidelines" and any relevant land use plans and development control regulations to ensure that development is strictly circumscribed in order to avoid any deterioration of the property\'s integrity, including in relation to aesthetic values. The draft planning and development control documents prepared to this end should be communicated to the World Heritage Centre prior to being formally adopted; \n 6.&nbsp; Urges  the State Party to carry out a comprehensive regional development and public use planning process focusing on achieving a consensual multi-stakeholder vision on conservation and economic development, with specific regard to the property\'s Outstanding Universal Value; \n 7.&nbsp; Also requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2011 , a report on the state of conservation of the property, focusing specifically on progress in halting existing development permits within the property and establishing an effective development control system, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 35th session in 2011.
