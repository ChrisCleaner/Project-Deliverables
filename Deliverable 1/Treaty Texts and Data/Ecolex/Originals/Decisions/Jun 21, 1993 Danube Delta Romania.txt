The Bureau recalled that the Committee, at its last session, drew the attention of the Romanian authorities to the fact that they were yet to complete the final steps to establish a legislative framework for this site, despite the assurances of the Representative of Romania to the fifteenth session of the Committee in December 1991, when the Delta Danube was inscribed on the World Heritage List. The Bureau was informed that the Ministry . of Waters, Forests and Environmental Protection of Romania has prepared the draft of the law concerning the establishment of the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve and included it as part of the working agenda of the Parliament and that this draft will be considered soon. \n The Bureau noted that the Danube Delta World Heritage site will benefit from the Danube River Basin Environment Programme which will be financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and implemented with technical advice from IUCN. \n The Representative of Romania informed the Bureau that new research institution for the Danube Delta has been established and will undertake studies relevant to the conservation of the Danube Delta. The Bureau requested the Romanian authorities to inform the Centre when the Parliament has approved the draft law and encouraged them to co-operate with the Centre to prepare a technical assistance project for the conservation of the Danube Delta. IUCN and other non-governmental organizations should be involved to the extent possible.
