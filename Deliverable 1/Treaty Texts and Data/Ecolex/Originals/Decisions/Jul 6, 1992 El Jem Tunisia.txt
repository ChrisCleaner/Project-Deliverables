Despite the fact that it was aware of the efforts of specialists and the Tunisian authorities for conserving this site, the Bureau was, however, concerned about the modifications which affected the environment of the site and requested the competent authorities to take urgent measures necessary to re&shy;establish the harmony of the site and its surroundings, halt all new constructions in the immediate environs and demolish the shopping arcade constructed on one side of the amphitheatre. If it is not possible to demolish the arcade, then it would be desirable to conceal it with a hedge. Insofar as the organization of spectacles inside the amphitheatre does not imply irreversible developments, the Bureau considered that the recreational activities do not constitute a threat to the conservation of the site.
