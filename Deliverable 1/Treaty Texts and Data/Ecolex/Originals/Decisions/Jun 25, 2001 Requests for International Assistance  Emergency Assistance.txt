VII.34  In examining the three Emergency Assistance requests, \n the Bureau  decided  to exceptionally waiver the application of paragraph 96 of the Operational Guidelines to provide Emergency Assistance to two World Heritage properties that clearly required special and urgent attention. \n The Bureau  noted  the constraint in the allocation of Emergency Assistance caused by the distinction made between &ldquo;unexpected phenomena&rdquo; and &ldquo;gradual phenomena&rdquo; of paragraph 96 of the Operational Guidelines, and \n  requested  the Centre and the Advisory Bodies to consider the relevance of such a distinction for providing Emergency Assistance, particularly for the World Heritage properties in Danger, for consideration during the process of revising the Operational Guidelines. \n &nbsp;
