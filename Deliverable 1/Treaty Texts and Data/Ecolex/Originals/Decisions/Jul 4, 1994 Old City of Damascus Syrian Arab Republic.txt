December 1993, a working meeting was held at Headquarters on 31 May 1994, with the Delegate of the Syrian Arab Republic to UNESCO and the national authorities in charge of the conservation of the cultural heritage. \n A work plan for this site was thus prepared which will be financed through the US$ 19,500 accorded by the Chairperson of the World Heritage Committee in 1992. A technological partnership has been set up by UNESCO with the Electricity of France which will provide one or two experts in hydrogeology, and thus make substantial savings. A contract for the use of the balance of the US$ 19,500 is being prepared with the Syrian Ministry of Culture. The Bureau noted with satisfaction the progress made on this project.
