The  First Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. I/12A  to agree to the following clarification of the definition of controlled substances (in bulk) in Article 1, paragraph 4 of the Montreal Protocol:     Article 1 of the Montreal Protocol excludes from consideration as a \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substance\xe2\x80\x9d any listed substance, whether alone or in a mixture, which is in a manufactured product other than a container used for transportation or storage;   any amount of a controlled substance or a mixture of controlled substances which is not part of a use system containing the substance is a controlled substance for the purpose of the Protocol (i.e. a bulk chemical);   if a substance or mixture must first be transferred from a bulk container to another container, vessel or piece of equipment in order to realize its intended use, the first container is in fact utilized only for storage and/or transport, and the substance or mixture so packaged is covered by Article 1, paragraph 4 of the Protocol;   if, on the other hand, the mere dispensing of the product from a container constitutes the intended use of the substance, then that container is itself part of a use system and the substance contained in it is therefore excluded from the definition;   examples of use systems to be considered as products for the purposes of Article 1, paragraph 4 are  inter alia:      an aerosol can;   a refrigerator or refrigerating plant, air conditioner or air-conditioning plant, heat pump, etc;   a polyurethane prepolymer or any foam containing, or manufactured with, a controlled substance;   a fire extinguisher (wheel or hand-operated) or an installed container incorporating a release device (automatic or hand-operated);     bulk containers for shipment of controlled substances and mixtures containing controlled substances to users include (numbers being illustrative),  inter alia:      tanks installed on board ships;   rail tank cars (10-40 metric tons);   road tankers (up to 20 metric tons);   cylinders from 0.4 kg to one metric ton;   drums (5-300 kg);     because containers of all sizes are used for either bulk or manufactured products, distinguishing on the basis of size is not consistent with the definition in the Protocol. Similarly, since containers for bulk or manufactured products can be designed to be rechargeable or not rechargeable, rechargeability is not sufficient for a consistent definition;   if the purpose of the container is used as the distinguishing characteristic as in the Protocol definition, such CFC or halon-containing products as aerosol spray cans and fire extinguishers, whether of the portable or flooding type, would therefore be excluded, because it is the mere release from such containers which constitute the intended use.
