V.259&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ICOMOS expert mission was undertaken to the site in order to assess the impact of a road construction project on the universal values of the site. ICOMOS presented the conclusions of the mission. \n V.260&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau notes the conclusion of the ICOMOS expert mission to Weimar, that the proposed bypass road (Variant 1): (i) will bring relief to the centre of the city of Weimar, (ii) will not have a negative impact on the fabric of the Tiefurt Schloss and its grounds and (iii) that mitigation measures will be able to conceal the road and will mitigate the effects of traffic on the road from possible viewpoints in Tiefurt Park. It requests the Secretariat to transmit the report to the German authorities for consideration, requesting them to prepare a progress report on the project and mitigation measures by 15 September 2001 for examination by the Bureau at its twenty-fifth extraordinary session.
