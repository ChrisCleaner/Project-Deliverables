The Bureau was informed by IUCN of the first World Heritage mission to this mixed site. The report indicated problems at the site with landowner residents, aboriginal concerns as well as the fact that no management plan has yet been prepared. However, the Commonwealth is taking up these issues and furthermore, a socio&shy;economic impact study is underway. IUCN suggested that all authorities consider renominating the area under cultural criteria and with a reduced boundary. The Observer of Australia informed the Bureau that through the agreed management arrangements for the site, a review of the boundaries is being conducted by a Technial and Scientific Advisory Committee. The results of this review will be conveyed to the World Heritage Centre. \n The Bureau took note of IUCN\'s suggestions that the Willandra Lakes site be considered for a revised nomination based on cultural criteria and that redefinition of the boundaries of the site be considered. The World Heritage Centre was requested to consult the Australian Government, ICOMOS, the International Union of Geological Sciences and IUCN and to report back on the findings to the Committee.
