Property:  Curonian Spit  \n Id. N&deg;:  994  \n State Party:  Lithuania/Russian Federation  \n Criteria:  C (v)  \n The Committee inscribed the Curonian Spit as a cultural landscape on the World Heritage List on the basis of  criterion (v) : \n  Criterion (v)  The Curonian Spit is an outstanding example of a landscape of sand dunes that is under constant threat from natural forces (wind and tide). After disastrous human interventions that menaced its survival the Spit was reclaimed by massive protection and stabilization works begun in the 19th century and still continuing to the present day. \n Concerning natural values, the Committee noted that the Curonian Spit is an important site at the European scale and very significant within the Baltic Region as a whole. However, it was not considered to meet the criteria for inscription on the World Heritage List as a natural property. \n The Committee welcomed the effective collaboration in the management planning between the two States Parties. \n The Observer of Lithuania in expressing her appreciation, informed the Committee of her Government\'s commitment to the effective protection of this fragile environment. The Observer from the Russian Federation noted that this is the first cultural landscape from his country and a result of continuous transborder co-operation for the last two years. He hoped that a similar exercise could be envisaged with Finland for a potential World Heritage area. \n &nbsp;
