With regard to the  Historic Centres of Stralsund and Wismar, Germany,  the World Heritage Committee,   Recommends  to the German authorities that special attention be given to the regulation of the design of modern details and the appropriate use of materials and technology in the rehabilitation of historic structures. The height and design of any new building or addition considered as essential within the historic core area and in its surroundings should respect the traditional skyline and character of the historic town.
