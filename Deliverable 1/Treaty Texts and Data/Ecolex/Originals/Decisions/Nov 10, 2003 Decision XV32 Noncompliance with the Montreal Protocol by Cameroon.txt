The  Fifteenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XV/32:      To note that, in accordance with decision XIV/32 of the Fourteenth Meeting of the Parties, Cameroon was requested to submit to the Implementation Committee a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance with regard to its consumption of Annex A, group I substances;   To note also that Cameroon has reported data for 2002 suggesting that it may now be in compliance with the freeze on CFC consumption, but that it has still not submitted data for the control period 1 July 2001-31 December 2002;   To urge Cameroon, accordingly, to report data for the control period 1 July 2001-31 December 2002 as a matter of urgency;   To note further that Cameroon\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for Annex A, group II substances is 2.38 ODP-tonnes. It reported consumption of 9 ODP-tonnes for Annex A, group II substances in 2002. As a consequence, for 2002 Cameroon was in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2B of the Montreal Protocol;   To note with appreciation Cameroon\xe2\x80\x99s submission of its plan of action to ensure a prompt return to compliance with the control measures for Annex A, group II substances, and to note also that, under the plan, Cameroon specifically commits itself:     To reducing halon consumption from 9 ODP-tonnes in 2002 as follows:     To 3 ODP-tonnes in 2003;   To 2.38 ODP-tonnes in 2004;   To phasing out halon consumption by 1 January 2010, as required under the Montreal Protocol, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To monitoring its existing system for licensing imports and exports of ODS, including quotas introduced in 2003;   To monitoring its existing ban on imports of ODS-using equipment, introduced in 1996;     To note that the measures listed in paragraph 5 above should enable Cameroon to return to compliance, with respect to consumption of halons, by 2005, and to urge Cameroon to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase out consumption of ozone-depleting substances in Annex A, group II;   To note also that Cameroon\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for the controlled substance in Annex E is 18.09 ODP-tonnes. It reported consumption of 25.38 ODP-tonnes of the controlled substance in Annex E in 2002. As a consequence, for 2002 Cameroon was in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2H of the Montreal Protocol;   To request Cameroon to submit to the Implementation Committee a plan of action with time-specific benchmarks to ensure a prompt return to compliance with respect to consumption of the controlled substance in Annex E;   To monitor closely the progress of Cameroon with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of halons and methyl bromide. To the degree that Cameroon is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, Cameroon should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet those commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution Cameroon, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that it fails to return to compliance in a timely manner the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of halons and methyl bromide (that is, the subject of non-compliance) is ceased and that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
