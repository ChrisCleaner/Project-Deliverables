The World Heritage Committee,  1.  Having examined  Documents   WHC-05/29.COM/8B  ,   WHC-05/29.COM/8B.Add 2   and   WHC-05/29.COM/INF.8B.1  ,  2.  Recalling  Decision  28 COM 14B.19  adopted at its 28th session (Suzhou, 2004),  3.  Inscribes   St Kilda  (United Kingdom) on the World Heritage List on the basis of cultural criteria (iii) and (v):   Criterion (iii):  St. Kilda bears exceptional testimony to over two millennia of human occupation in extreme conditions.   Criterion (v):  The cultural landscape of St. Kilda is an outstanding example of land use resulting from a type of subsistence economy based on the products of birds, cultivating land and keeping sheep. The cultural landscape reflects age-old traditions and land uses, which have become vulnerable to change particularly after the departure of the islanders.  4.  Requests  the State Party of the United Kingdom to undertake a systematic archaeological survey to underpin future management of the cultural landscape.
