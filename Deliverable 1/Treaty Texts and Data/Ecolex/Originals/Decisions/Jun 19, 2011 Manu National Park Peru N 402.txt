The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document WHC-11/35.COM/7B.Add, \n 2.  Recalling  Decision  34 COM 7B.36,  adopted at its 34th session (Brasilia, 2010), \n 3.  Takes note  of the recommendations of the December 2010 joint World Heritage Centre/IUCN reactive monitoring mission; \n 4.  Requests  the State Party to consider the recommendations of the 2010 reactive monitoring mission in future management, with a particular focus on: \n a) Strengthening governmental capacity across sectors to effectively plan infrastructure and land and resource use in the Alto Madre de Dios river corridor, including in the buffer zone of the property and adjacent protected areas and communal reserves, \n b) Strengthening governmental capacity for participatory planning, management and law enforcement in the "recuperation", "special use" and buffer zones, \n c) Using the current updating of the Master Plan as an opportunity to identify staffing and funding gaps and derive realistic and concrete funding strategies, including from Peru\'s Conservation Fund (PROFONANPE), private sector companies involved in hydrocarbon extraction, and tourism revenues, \n d) Protecting the indigenous peoples living in voluntary isolation and in initial contact from external pressures and engage with sedentary indigenous groups within the property in a more meaningful dialogue to define the future, \n e) Revitalizing an operational multi-stakeholder management committee, which is designed to provide advice to management planning processes, including in the buffer zone, \n f) Considering the feasibility of a minor boundary modification including Megantoni National Sanctuary in the property; \n 5.  Takes note with appreciation  of the commitment of Hunt Oil, which is exploring gas reserves in the region, and that there is no intention to plan or build a pipeline affecting the property, as also documented in the State Party report; \n 6.  Notes with concern  that the planned road from Boca Manu to Boca Colorado is likely to result in increasing pressures on the property\'s natural resources and therefore  also requests  the State Party to conduct an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) of the planned road, in order to balance the associated risks and benefits and ensure that it does not negatively impact on the property\'s Outstanding Universal Value, nor on forest-dependent indigenous communities, and submit its results to the World Heritage Centre as soon as possible, in line with Paragraph 172 of the Operational Guidelines prior to implementation of this project; \n 7.  Further requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2014 , a report on the state of conservation of the property, including a copy of the Environmental and social Impact Assessment for the Boca Manu - Boca Colorado road, as well as a report on progress achieved in the implementation of the 2010 joint World Heritage Centre/IUCN mission recommendations.
