The World Heritage Committee, \n 1.  Having examined  Document  WHC-08/32.COM/7B.Add , \n 2.  Recalling  Decisions  30 COM 7B.74 and 31 COM 7B.90 , adopted at its 30th (Vilnius, 2006) and 31st (Christchurch, 2007) sessions respectively, \n 3.  Notes  the actions taken by the State Party in response to the World Heritage Committee\'s requests in developing a management plan, preparing guidance on methodology for assessing development in World Heritage views, and giving protection to the view of the Tower from the South Bank; \n 4.  Also notes  progress with implementing proposals associated with the "Heritage Protection White Paper" and its subsequent "Heritage Protection Bill"; \n 5.  Regrets  that no buffer zone with protection has been put in place and that no specific skyline study of the Tower, its setting and views, has been carried out, to allow rapid in-depth assessments of the impact of development proposals in the immediate vicinity of the World Heritage property, \n 6.  Also regrets  that there appears to be lack of clarity on the management system set out in the management plan for addressing conflicts between conservation and development, particularly in the setting; \n 7.  Further regrets  that large development projects with tall buildings continue to be approved while the issue of the property and its setting has not yet been resolved; \n 8.  Takes note  that the State Party has begun to comply with the requests of the World Heritage Committee (Decision  31 COM 7B.90 ) to protect the property, its setting and related vistas and  defers  consideration of the inscription of the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger to its 33rd session in 2009; \n 9.  Requests  the State Party to submit to the World Heritage Centre, by  1 February 2009,  a progress report on the above issues, for examination by the World Heritage Committee at its 33rd session in 2009.
