The General Assembly then took note of the accounts of the World Heritage Fund for the financial period ending 31 December 1985, of the interim statement of accounts for the period 1986\xc2\xad1987 drawn up as at 31 August 1987 and of the summary of contributions received from States Parties as at 31 August 1987. The Assembly also took note of the information provided by the Secretariat concerning the contributions received since 31 August 1987.  11. Referring to the interim statement of accounts for the financial period 1986-1987, a speaker underlined the high figure of liquid assets which could be used to carry out safeguard projects. In reply to this question, the Secretariat stated that the General Assembly always met a very short time before the session of the Committee, and that the amount of liquid as\xc2\xadsets was normal since it was necessary at the end of each year to have sufficient funds available so as to enable the Committee to adopt a budget corresponding to the activities carried out during the following year. The next session of the Commit\xc2\xadtee would take place early December; at that time and thanks to the funds available, the Committee would be able to respond favourably to the requests for technical cooperation. A dele\xc2\xadgate drew the attention of the Secretariat to the number of unliquidated obligations for 1981-1985 and he suggested that these projects should be re-examined. The Secretariat stated that such was its intention and that this question would be brought to the attention of the Committee in December.
