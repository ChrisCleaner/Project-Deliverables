The Bureau recalled that, at its nineteenth session, the World Heritage Committee decided that, on the basis of both ascertained dangers and potential threats, Yellowstone National Park be inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger and that the State Party should provide the Committee with reports on the results of the Environmental Impact Statement and mitigating actions. In such a report dated May 1996, the State Party advised the Centre about the different remedial actions taken. This includes long-term control programmes to counter the non-native lake trout introduction, public meetings to analyze visitor management, and the preparation of the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) for the proposed New World Mine; the final EIS is not expected to be completed before autumn 1996. \n The Bureau recommended that the site be retained on the List of World Heritage in Danger until such time as the mining-related Environmental Impact Study required under domestic law is completed and considered, and actions taken on other issues previously identified.
