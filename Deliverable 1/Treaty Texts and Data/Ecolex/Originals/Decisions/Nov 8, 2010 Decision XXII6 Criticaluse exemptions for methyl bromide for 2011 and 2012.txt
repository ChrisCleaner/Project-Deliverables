Noting with appreciation  the work by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee,    Recognizing  the significant reductions made in critical-use nominations for methyl bromide in many parties,    Recalling  paragraph 10 of decision XVII/9,    Recalling also  that all parties that have nominated critical-use exemptions are to report data on stocks using the accounting framework agreed on by the Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties,    Recognizing  that the production and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses should be permitted only if methyl bromide is not available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled methyl bromide,    Recognizing also  that parties operating under a critical-use exemption should take into account the extent to which methyl bromide is available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled methyl bromide in licensing, permitting or authorizing the production and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses ,     Stressing  that parties should reduce their stocks of methyl bromide retained for employment in critical-use exemptions to a minimum in as short a time period as possible,   1. To permit, for the agreed critical-use categories for 2011 set forth in table A of the annex to the present decision for each party, subject to the conditions set forth in the present decision and decision Ex.I/4 to the extent that those conditions are applicable, the levels of production and consumption for 2011 set forth in table B of the annex to the present decision which are necessary to satisfy critical uses, in addition to the amounts permitted in decision XXI/11;   2. To permit, for the agreed critical-use categories for 2012 set forth in table C of the annex to the present decision for each party, subject to the conditions set forth in the present decision and in decision Ex.I/4 to the extent that those conditions are applicable, the levels of production and consumption for 2012 set forth in table D of the annex to the present decision which are necessary to satisfy critical uses, with the understanding that additional levels of production and consumption and categories of uses may be approved by the Meeting of the Parties in accordance with decision\xc2\xa0IX/6;   3. That parties shall endeavour to license, permit, authorize or allocate quantities of methyl bromide for critical uses as listed in tables A and C of the annex to the present decision;   4. To recognize the continued contribution of the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee\'s expertise and to agree that, in accordance with section 4.1 of the terms of reference of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, the Committee should ensure that it develops its recommendations in a consensus process that includes full discussion among all available Committee members and should ensure that members with relevant expertise are involved in developing its recommendations;   5. That each party that has an agreed critical-use exemption shall renew its commitment to ensuring that the criteria in paragraph 1 of decision IX/6, in particular the criterion laid down in paragraph 1 (b) (ii) of decision IX/6, are applied in licensing, permitting or authorizing critical uses of methyl bromide, with each party requested to report on the implementation of the present provision to the Ozone Secretariat by 1 February for the years to which the present decision applies;   6. To urge parties operating under a critical-use exemption to put in place an effective system to discourage the accumulation of methyl bromide produced under the exemption;   Annex to decision XXII/6: Critical use exemptions  Table A  Agreed critical-use categories for 2011 (metric tonnes)       Australia   Strawberry runners (5.950)     Canada   Pasta (2.084)     Israel   Broomrape - protected (12.500), cucumbers (12.500), cut flowers and bulbs - protected (52.330), cut flowers - open field (23.292), melons - protected and open field (35.000), strawberry fruit - Sharon and Gaza (41.875), strawberry runners - Sharon and Gaza (27.000), sweet potatoes (20.000)     Table B  Permitted levels of production and consumption for 2011 (metric tonnes)       Australia   5.950     Canada   2.084     Israel   224.497     Table C  Agreed critical-use categories for 2012 (metric tonnes)       Australia   Strawberry runners (29.760), rice (3.653)     Canada   Mills (11.020), strawberry runners (Prince Edward Island) (5.261)     Japan   Chestnuts (3.489), cucumbers (26.162), ginger - field (42.235), ginger - protected (6.558), melons (67.936), peppers - green and hot (61.154), watermelons (12.075)     United States of America   Commodities (2.419), National Pest Management Association food-processing structures (0.200), mills and processors (74.510), dried cured pork (3.730), cucurbits (59.500), eggplant - field (6.904), forest nursery seedlings (34.230), nursery stock - fruit, nuts, flowers (1.591), orchard replants (18.324), ornamentals (48.164), peppers - field (28.366), strawberry - field (678.004), strawberry runners (3.752), tomatoes - field (54.423), sweet potato slips (8.709)     Table D  Permitted levels of production and consumption for 2012 (metric tonnes)       Australia   33.413     Canada   16.281     Japan   219.609     United States of America   922.826*     [* Minus available stocks.]
