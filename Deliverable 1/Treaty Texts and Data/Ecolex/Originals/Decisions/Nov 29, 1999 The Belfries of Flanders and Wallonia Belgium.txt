Property:  The Belfries of Flanders and Wallonia  \n Id. N&deg;:  943  \n State Party:  Belgium    \n Criteria:  C (ii) (iv)  \n The Committee inscribed the site on the World Heritage List on the basis of  criteria (ii)  and  (iv) : \n   Criterion (ii   ) : The belfries of Belgium are exceptional examples of a form of urban architecture adapted to the political and spiritual requirements of their age. \n   Criterion (iv):   The Middle Ages saw the emergence of towns that were independent of the prevalent feudal system. The belfries in the historic County of Flanders and in Wallonia symbolize this new-found independence, and also the links within them between the secular and religious powers. \n The Committee noted that this serial inscription was of particular interest as the monuments are located in different cities and regions of the State Party. \n &nbsp;
