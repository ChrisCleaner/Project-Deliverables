The Committee decided to enter in the World Heritage List the twenty-four cultural and natural properties which had been recommended by the Bureau: \n         \n \n  Name of Property  Contracting State having submitted the nomination of the property in accordance with the Convention  Identification No.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Tassili n\'Ajjer\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n Algeria \n \xc2\xa0179 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0The M\'Zab Valley \n \n \n Algeria \n \xc2\xa0188 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Djemila\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n Algeria \n \xc2\xa0191 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Tipasa \n \n \n Algeria \n \xc2\xa0193 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Timgad \n \n \n Algeria \n \xc2\xa0194 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks \n \n The Committee is seriously concerned at the likely effect of dam construction in the area on those natural and cultural characteristics which make the property of outstanding universal value. In particular, it considers that flooding of parts of the river valleys would destroy a number of cultural and natural features of great significance, as identified in the ICOMOS and IUCN reports. The Committee therefore recommends that the Australian authorities take all possible measures to protect the integrity of the property. The Committee suggests that the Australian authorities should ask the Committee to place the property on the List of World Heritage in Danger until the question of dam construction is resolved. \n \n Australia \n \xc2\xa0181 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Lord Howe Island Group \n \n In view of the importance of Lord Howe Island as a World Heritage site, the World Heritage Committee suggests that steps be taken to replace the telecommunications towers as soon as satellite communications are available. \n \n Australia \n \xc2\xa0186 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Historic Centre of the town of Olinda \n \n \n Brazil \n \xc2\xa0189 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Old Havana and its Fortifications \n \n \n Cuba \n \xc2\xa0204 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0The Royal Saltworks of Arc et Senans \n \n \n France \n \xc2\xa0203 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0National History Park -Citadel, Sans Souci, Ramiers \n \n The Committee recommends that the Haitian authorities exercise the greatest care as regards the restoration and consolidation work on the entire site, which should be carried out in conformity with internationally recognized conservation standards. \n \n Haiti \n \xc2\xa0180 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0R\xc3\xado Pl\xc3\xa1tano Biosphere Reserve \n \n \n Honduras \n \xc2\xa0196 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0The Historic Centre of Florence \n \n \n Italy \n \xc2\xa0174 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Tai National Park\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n Ivory Coast \n \xc2\xa0195 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Archaeological Site of Leptis Magna \n \n \n Libyan Arab Jamahiriya \n \xc2\xa0183 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Archaeological Site of Sabratha \n \n \n Libyan Arab Jamahiriya \n \xc2\xa0184\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Archaeological Site of Cyrene \n \n \n Libyan Arab Jamahiriya \n \xc2\xa0190\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Aldabra Atoll \n \n \n Seychelles, Republic of \n \xc2\xa0195\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Sacred City of Anuradhapura \n \n \n Sri Lanka \n \xc2\xa0200\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Ancient City of Polonnaruwa \n \n \n Sri Lanka\xc2\xa0 \n \xc2\xa0201 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Ancient City of Sigiriya \n \n \n Sri Lanka\xc2\xa0 \n \xc2\xa0202\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Selous Game Reserve\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n Tanzania \n \xc2\xa0199 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0Cahakia Mounds State Historic Site \n \n \n United States of America \n \xc2\xa0198\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0The old walled City of Shibam \xc2\xa0 \n \n \n Yemen, People\'s Democratic Republic of \n \xc2\xa0192 \n \n \n \n \xc2\xa0
