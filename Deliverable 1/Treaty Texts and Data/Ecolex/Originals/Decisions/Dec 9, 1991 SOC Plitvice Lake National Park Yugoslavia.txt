Plitvice   Lake National Park (Yugoslavia)  \n The Committee expressed deep regret and concern regarding the effects of the civil unrest in the country on the status of conservation of this site. The Park has been abandoned by staff and there is no control of activities inside the Park. The Committee was appreciative of the various appeals launched by the Director-General of UNESCO for peace in the area and expressed the hope that conditions will return to normal soon to permit a joint UNESCO/IUCN mission to review damage and plan rehabilitation programmes. \n &nbsp;
