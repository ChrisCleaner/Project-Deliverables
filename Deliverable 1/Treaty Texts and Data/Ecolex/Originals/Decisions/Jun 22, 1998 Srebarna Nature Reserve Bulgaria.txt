The Bureau recalled that the Committee, at its nineteenth session (Berlin, 1995), had requested the Bulgarian authorities to submit, in 1998, a status report on measures taken to mitigate threats to the integrity of this site. Hence, the Bureau requested the Bulgarian authorities to submit the threat mitigation status report to the Centre before 15 September 1998, and IUCN to review that report and to make recommendations to the twenty-second session of the Committee. \n The Bureau suggested that the State Party consider inviting an IUCN mission to the site for verification of the results of the measures undertaken to mitigate threats to the integrity of Srebarna. It authorised the Centre to provide funds for IUCN from the monitoring allocation approved by the Committee for the European Region at its last session (December 1997), in order to enable IUCN to undertake such a mission.
