Glacier Bay&nbsp;National Park&nbsp;- extension of the&nbsp;Wrangell/St.Elias/Kluane site of Canada-USA  \n  72bis Rev&nbsp;&nbsp;  \n  United States of America   \n  N(ii)  \n The Committee inscribed the Glacier Bay National Park as an extension of the Wrangell/St. Elias/Kluane World Heritage site of Canada and the United States of America. The Committee encouraged the two States Parties to consider linking the Glacier Bay National Park with the Wrangell/St. Elias/Kluane unit; specifically, the Committee urged the American authorities to consider adding the Tongass National Forest Wilderness and the Canadian authorities to establish and incorporate a new protected area within the Haines Triangle. The Committee also requested the Canadian and American authorities to propose a new name such as "St. Elias Mountain Parks" for the transfrontier World Heritage property. The Committee expressed serious concerns over the prospect of potential impacts of the proposal to exploit the Windy Craggy mine in Canada. \n The Delegate of the United States and the Observer from Canada agreed to initiate processes necessary for the consideration and implementation of the Committee\'s recommendations. The Delegate of the United States informed the Committee that the Division of Environmental Affairs of the US Department of Interior had already written to the Canadian Ministry of Environment to request information concerning proposals to exploit the Windy Craggy mine and possible impacts on Glacier Bay. \n &nbsp;
