The  Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. XVII/37:      To note that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ratified the Montreal Protocol on 11 July 1990, the London Amendment on 12 July 2001 and the Copenhagen Amendment on 24 September 2004, is classified as a Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol and had its country programme approved by the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol in December 2000. The Executive Committee has approved $5,198,886 from the Multilateral Fund to enable the Party\xe2\x80\x99s compliance in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol;   To note further that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for Annex A, group II, controlled substances (halons) is 633.067 ODP-tonnes. It reported consumption in 2003 and 2004 of 714.500 ODP-tonnes of those substances. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\xe2\x80\x99s baseline for the controlled substance in Annex E (methyl bromide) is 94.050 ODP-tonnes. It reported consumption in 2004 of 96.000 ODP-tonnes of that substance. As a consequence, in 2003 the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was in non-compliance with its obligations under Article 2A of the Montreal Protocol, while in 2004 it was in non-compliance with its obligations under Articles 2A and 2H of the Protocol;   To note with appreciation the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\xe2\x80\x99s submission of a plan of action to ensure a prompt return to compliance with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s halon and methyl bromide control measures and to note that, under the plan, without prejudice to the operation of the financial mechanism of the Protocol, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya specifically commits itself:     To maintain consumption of the controlled substances in Annex A, group II (halons), at no more than the 2004 level of 714.500 ODP-tonnes in 2005 and then to reduce halon consumption as follows:     To 653.910 ODP-tonnes in 2006;   To 316.533 ODP-tonnes in 2007;   To phase out halon consumption by 1 January 2008, save for essential uses that may be authorized by the Parties;     To maintain consumption of the controlled substance in Annex E (methyl bromide) at no more than the 2004 level of 96.000 ODP-tonnes in 2005 and 2006 and then to reduce methyl bromide consumption as follows:     To 75.000 ODP-tonnes in 2007;   To phase out methyl bromide consumption by 1 January 2010, save for critical uses that may be authorized by the Parties;      To recall the commitment of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, contained in decision XV/36, to establish a system for licensing imports and exports of ozone-depleting substances, including quotas, and to monitor its ban on imports of equipment using ozone-depleting substances, introduced in 2003;   To note that the measures listed in paragraph 3 above should enable the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to return to compliance with the Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s halon and methyl bromide control measures in 2007, and to urge the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to work with the relevant implementing agencies to implement the plan of action and phase out consumption of halon and methyl bromide;   To monitor closely the progress of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya with regard to the implementation of its plan of action and the phase-out of Annex A, group II, controlled substances (halons) and the controlled substance in Annex E (methyl bromide). To the degree that the Party is working towards and meeting the specific Protocol control measures, it should continue to be treated in the same manner as a Party in good standing. In that regard, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya should continue to receive international assistance to enable it to meet its commitments in accordance with item A of the indicative list of measures that may be taken by a Meeting of the Parties in respect of non-compliance. Through the present decision, however, the Parties caution the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, in accordance with item B of the indicative list of measures, that in the event that it fails to remain in compliance, the Parties will consider measures consistent with item C of the indicative list of measures. Those measures may include the possibility of actions available under Article 4, such as ensuring that the supply of Annex A, group II, controlled substances (halons) and the controlled substance in Annex E (methyl bromide) that are the subject of non-compliance is ceased so that exporting Parties are not contributing to a continuing situation of non-compliance.
