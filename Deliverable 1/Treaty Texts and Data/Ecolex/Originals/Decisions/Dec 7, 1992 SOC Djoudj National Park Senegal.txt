Djoudj   National Park (Senegal)  \n The Committee recalled that the repair of barrages and gates regulating water flow into this wetland area was financed by the World Heritage Fund in 1988. The Committee noted that the parallel wooden planks, held together by clay, which keep the gates dry and resistant to water leaks and seepage to and from the Djoudj River, have been found to be defective, and that the Senegalese authorities had been provided emergency assistance for the purchase of wood to replace the existing planks at an estimated total cost of about US$10,000. The Delegate of Senegal thanked the Committee and informed the members that repair work was progressing rapidly and satisfactorily. \n &nbsp;
