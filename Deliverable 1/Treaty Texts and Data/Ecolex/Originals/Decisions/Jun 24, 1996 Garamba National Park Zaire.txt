In April 1996, the Centre and IUCN received information on the poaching of two Northern white rhinos (one female, one male adult). A joint WWF-Frankfurt Zoological Society-IUCN mission to the site was carried out recently and the findings will be transmitted to twentieth extraordinary session of the Bureau in November 1996. \n Given the gravity of the situation, notably concerning poaching of the white rhino population in Garamba National Park, the Bureau recommended to the Committee inscription of this site on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Bureau requested the Secretariat to obtain the commitment of the Zaire authorities for such listing and for submission of a plan for corrective measures in conformity with the Operational Guidelines
