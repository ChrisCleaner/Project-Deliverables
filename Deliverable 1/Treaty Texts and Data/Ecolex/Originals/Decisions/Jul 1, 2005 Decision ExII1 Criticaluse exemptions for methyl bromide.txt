The  Second Extraordinary Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. Ex.II/1:    Recognizing that technically and economically feasible alternatives exist for most uses of methyl bromide, and that those alternatives are not always technically and economically feasible in the circumstances of the nominations,    Mindful  that exemptions must fully comply with decision IX/6, including with regard to use minimization and emissions reduction, and that they are intended to be limited, temporary derogations from the phase-out of methyl bromide,    Recognizing  the value of gas retention or other techniques for minimizing emissions of methyl bromide and other chemical alternatives, and that such uses can achieve pest and disease control with significant reductions in dose,    Acknowledging  that further information described in decision Ex.I/4 will be submitted by the Parties in 2006,    Noting with appreciation  the work done by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee,     For the agreed critical uses for 2006, set forth in table A of the annex to the present decision , to permit, subject to the conditions set forth in the present decision and in decision Ex. I/4, to the extent those conditions are applicable, the supplementary levels of production and consumption for 2006 set forth in table B of the annex to the present decision which are necessary to satisfy critical uses, with the understanding that additional levels and categories of uses may be approved by the Seventeenth Meeting of the Parties in accordance with decision IX/6;   That a Party with a critical-use exemption level in excess of permitted levels of production and consumption for critical uses is to make up any such difference between those levels by using quantities of methyl bromide available from existing stocks;   That each Party which has an agreed critical use shall take into full consideration all quantities of existing stocks of methyl bromide and that the sum of these quantities shall be reported in 2006 in column G of the Framework Report, as set out in annex II to the report of the Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties , subject to confidentiality and disclosure clauses of domestic laws and regulations. Where all or part of the quantities are withheld pursuant to such laws and regulations, the reasons for withholding the quantities in column G shall be footnoted appropriately;   That Parties that have an agreed critical use shall endeavour to license, permit, authorize or allocate the quantities of methyl bromide recommended by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to the specific categories of use shown in table A of the annex to the present decision;   That each Party which has an agreed critical use renews its commitment to ensure that the criteria in paragraph 1 of decision IX/6 are applied when licensing, permitting or authorizing the use of methyl bromide and that such procedures take into account quantities of methyl bromide available from existing stocks;   To request Parties licensing, permitting or authorizing methyl bromide that is used for 2006 critical uses to ensure, wherever methyl bromide is authorized for critical-use exemptions, the use of emission minimization techniques such as virtually impermeable films, barrier film technologies, deep shank injection and/or other techniques that promote environmental protection, whenever technically and economically feasible.
