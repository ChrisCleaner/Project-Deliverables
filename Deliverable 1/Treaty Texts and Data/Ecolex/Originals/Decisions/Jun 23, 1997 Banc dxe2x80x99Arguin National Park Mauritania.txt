The Bureau was informed that the Centre\'s attention had been drawn by the International Foundation for Banc d&rsquo;Arguin (FIBA) and WWF, to a Rally, &ldquo;Troph&eacute;e des Gazelles - Rallye des Sables&rdquo;, that had traversed the area of the Park and to potential impacts which the Rally could have had on the fragile ecosystem within the Park. However, the Bureau noted that subsequently the Rally Organizers and FIBA have informed the Centre that the Rally did not traverse the World Heritage site and that there were no threats to the integrity of the site.
