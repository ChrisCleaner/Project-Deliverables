&nbsp; Considering  that Article III of the Convention requests Parties to prevent, reduce and/or strictly control the introduction of exotic species, and to control and/or eliminate those already introduced;  &nbsp; Aware  that invasive alien species (IAS) have an impact on migratory species through predation, competition and genetic changes caused by hybridization, as well as through the transmission of diseases, impairment of breeding and by causing loss of habitat and resources crucial for migratory species;   Noting  that the impact of IAS may result in local extinction or decline in population numbers of certain species as well as changes to migration patterns, and that the natural behaviour of migratory species may lead to negative interactions with IAS not only in their breeding, stopover and wintering grounds, but also during migrations, which can result in cumulative impacts from IAS;   Stressing  the need to encourage continued research and collection of data on impacts on migratory species posed by IAS, and also the importance of ensuring that future management of migratory species and their habitats adequately takes into account consequent impacts and risks posed by IAS;   Stressing  the need to encourage continued research and collection of data on impacts on migratory species posed by IAS, and also the importance of ensuring that future management of migratory species and their habitats adequately takes into account consequent impacts and risks posed by IAS;   Noting  that IAS issues are explicitly covered by CMS and related instruments concluded under its auspices, including the updated CMS Strategic Plan 2006-2014 (UNEP/CMS/Conf.10.22) and the new CMS Strategic Plan 2015-2023 where IAS are considered as one of the threats to migratory species, requiring specific measures to be dealt with, within the specificities of CMS;   Remarking  that the inclusion of provisions to prevent and/or control IAS is already ensured by the Convention, where needed, e.g. within the International Single Species Action Plans (SSAP) for endangered species included in Appendix I developed in cooperation with the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s daughter instruments and other partner organizations, as it is the case of the CMS/AEWA SSAP for the White-headed duck, supported by the EU and the Bern Convention;   Appreciating  that a number of CMS Agreements have already made progress towards tackling the threats posed by IAS to species listed on Appendix II, e.g. the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) in 2006 adopted Guidelines on Avoidance of Introductions of Non-Native Waterbird Species;   Noting with satisfaction  the important contribution of specific initiatives such as the adoption by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) of conservation guidelines aiming at assisting with the development of plans for the eradication of introduced vertebrates from breeding sites of ACAP species (particularly seabirds on islands);   Welcoming  initiatives such as the Wadden Sea Plan 2010 adopted by the Common Wadden Sea Secretariat, which supports the Agreement on the Conservation of Seals in the Wadden Sea as well as the Trilateral Sea Cooperation, which foresees intensified support and efforts to harmonize approaches to the prevention, management and monitoring of aquatic and terrestrial IAS;   Recognizing  the collaborative effort required at global, regional and local levels to deal with IAS, especially through prevention, early detection and rapid response, and that such efforts require collaboration among governments, economic sectors and non-governmental and international organizations;   Appreciating  the important developments in the growth of inter-sectoral cooperation on IAS issues between different institutions and organizations and stressing that systematic cooperation between different conventions and agreements would provide greater and more effective opportunities to address issues related to IAS;   Welcoming  the Convention on Biological Diversity\xe2\x80\x99s work on addressing the risks associated with the introduction of IAS\xe2\x80\x99s;   Aware  of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\xe2\x80\x932020 adopted at COP10 by the Convention for Biological Diversity (Nagoya, October 2010) including Target 9 the aims of which are: \xe2\x80\x9cinvasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment\xe2\x80\x9d;   Welcoming  the 5th CBD/Ramsar Joint Work Plan, for 2011-2020, through which Ramsar delivers its leading role for implementing CBD programmes of work related to wetlands, including on inland waters, marine and coastal biodiversity and protected areas, as well as the revised CMS/Ramsar Joint Work Plan, as flexible frameworks for collaboration with CBD, CMS and its wetland-relevant Agreements and Memoranda (see Ramsar Resolution XI.6);   Noting  CMS Resolution 10.21 which welcomed the revised CMS/Ramsar Memorandum of Cooperation and Joint Work Plan as a flexible framework for collaboration with the CMS and its wetland-relevant sister Agreements and Memoranda;   Further noting  CITES Resolution Conf.13.10 (Rev. CoP14) on \xe2\x80\x9cTrade in alien invasive species\xe2\x80\x9d recommending that the Parties consider the opportunities for synergy with CBD and explore appropriate cooperation and collaboration on the issue of introductions of alien species that are potentially invasive; and   Taking note  of the Review of the Impact of Invasive Alien Species on Species under CMS (UNEP/CMS/COP11/Inf.32) undertaken by the IUCN/SSC Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) and thanking the government of Italy for funding this Review;   The Conference of the Parties to the    Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals    1.Calls  on Parties and non-Parties to address threats from IAS and particularly to undertake concrete dedicated actions aimed at preventing and mitigating the negative impact of IAS on migratory species, consistent with applicable international obligations and with a focus on CMS-listed species, including the elaboration of national lists of species for which restrictions might apply, development and further implementation of specific and/or thematic action plans and management plans for species and pathways of greater concern, focusing on Best Practices for Addressing Risks to Biodiversity including preventing the introduction of listed species, and where IAS threats have established eradicating priority IAS from priority sites, or controlling priority IAS threats (where eradication isn\'t feasible) also at priority sites;  2.  Requests  the Scientific Council to ensure that the following are addressed: the improvement of understanding of interactions between IAS and threatened migratory species; the development of priorities for intervention; and the improvement in international cooperation and development of adaptable management strategies when discussing topics for which IAS might be relevant;  3.  Instructs  the Secretariat to continue to streamline activities focusing on IAS issues within the CMS Family Secretariats, whenever feasible and relevant and within the mandates given by their Parties/Signatories, in order to enhance the effective delivery of concrete conservation action (including active management of IAS and the threatened CMS species) and awareness-raising;  4.  Invites  Parties and non-Parties to take into account the risk of migratory species to become invasive themselves if translocated and/or introduced outside their natural range, by undertaking dedicated risk assessments incorporating future climate change scenarios for any movement of animals, including measures related to conservation actions targeting endangered species;  5.  Further invites  Parties and non-Parties to take into account the risk of facilitating the introduction or spread of IAS while implementing any climate change mitigation or adaptation measures;  6.  Instructs  the Secretariat to encourage Parties and non-Parties: (i) to ensure at national level, effective collaboration in relation to issues concerning IAS among national authorities and focal points that deal with the CBD, the CITES, Ramsar Convention, the Bern Convention, IMO, IPPC, OIE and other organizations as appropriate (ii) to address threats from IAS and  ( iii) as appropriate, to make full use of existing guidelines in addressing the risks associated with the introduction of alien species;  7.  Further instructs  the Secretariat to identify potential strategic partners and engage with them when developing information campaigns and other outreach activities and  encourages  all relevant stakeholders to contribute to these initiatives;   Urges  the Scientific Council to address at its future meetings options for enhanced cooperation, policy coherence and implementation with regard to work on IAS, in a manner consistent with their mandates, governance arrangements and agreed programmes of the Scientific Council and other MEAs;  9.  Instructs  the Secretariat, resources permitting, to participate in the Inter-Agency Liaison Group on Invasive Alien Species, established by decision IX/4 of CBD to address gaps and inconsistencies in the international regulatory framework on the IAS issue;  10.  Noting  the need for closer collaboration with other MEAs to harmonize efforts to further address the issue of IAS, including by developing guidance, analysing the risks associated with the introduction of alien species that are a potential threat to biodiversity, and taking note that the risks associated with the introduction of alien species may include impacts on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity at the ecosystem, species and gene levels, in order to support measures to prevent the introduction and spread of the most harmful species;  11.  Encourages  Parties, non-Parties and donors to provide financial support to ensure that adequate resources are provided to the Secretariat to allow partnerships to be developed and strengthened;  12.  Requests  Parties, non-Parties and donors to avoid policies and initiatives that either limit the use of effective measures to eradicate or control IAS threatening migratory species or facilitate the introduction and further spread of IAS which represent or might present a threat to migratory species; and  13.  Instructs  the Secretariat to develop closer consultative relationships with a number of environment funding organizations with a view to mobilizing resources for the implementation of the measures directed at dealing with IAS issues in relation to migratory species.
