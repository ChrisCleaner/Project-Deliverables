The Classical Gardens of Suzhou   \n  813   \n  China     \n  C(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)(v)   \n The Committee decided to inscribe this property on the basis of criteria (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), considering that the four classical gardens of Suzhou are masterpieces of Chinese landscape garden design in which art, nature, and ideas are integrated perfectly to create ensembles of great beauty and peaceful harmony, and four gardens are integral to the entire historic urban plan. The Committee, however, recommended that the State Party submit a nomination to extend the World Heritage protection to cover historic sectors of Suzhou and to take measures to maintain the integrity of this historic town, whose cultural value, marked by the linkage between its canal system and its gardens, extends beyond the four nominated gardens. \n &nbsp;
