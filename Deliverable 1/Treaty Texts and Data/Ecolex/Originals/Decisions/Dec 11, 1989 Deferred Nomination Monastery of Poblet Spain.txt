Monastery of Poblet  \n  Spain  \n The Committee decided to defer its decision on this property while awaiting the assurance that the protective boundaries be enlarged to encompass the outer wall of the monastery and that all of the nominated area be given adequate protection. \n The Committee took note of the intervention of the Spanish delegate informing it that the Catalan authorities were currently preparing a decree aiming to enlarge the protective boundaries of this property and that, in liaison with the Ministry of Culture of Spain, they were going to follow a conservation policy which would respect the original forms and materials. \n The Committee was glad to note that, therefore, it would be able to inscribe this eminent property on the World Heritage List in the near future. \n &nbsp;
