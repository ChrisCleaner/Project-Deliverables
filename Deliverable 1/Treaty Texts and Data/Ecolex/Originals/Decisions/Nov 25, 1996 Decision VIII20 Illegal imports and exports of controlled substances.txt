The  Eighth Meeting of the Parties  decided in  Dec. VIII/20:      To note with appreciation the report prepared by the Secretariat on illegal imports and exports of ozone-depleting substances;   To urge each Party not operating under Article 5 that has not already done so to establish a system requiring validation and approval of imports of any used, recycled or reclaimed ozone-depleting substances before they are imported. Importers should sufficiently demonstrate to approving authorities that the ozone-depleting substances have indeed been previously used;   To request each Party not operating under Article 5 to report to the Secretariat by the Ninth Meeting of the Parties on the establishment of the system described in paragraph 2 above;   That the exception in decision IV/24 (which provides that the import and export of recycled and used controlled substances not be taken into account in the calculation of the Party\xe2\x80\x99s consumption level) shall not apply to any Party not operating under Article 5 that has not established by 1 January 1998 a system such as that described in paragraph 2 above;   To request the Ninth Meeting of the Parties to consider instituting a system to require validation and approval of exports of used and recycled ozone-depleting substances from all Parties.
