National Historic Park - Citadelle, Sans Souci, Ramiers (Haiti)  \n A major ISPAN/UNDP/UNESCO project considerably contributed to the preservation and enhancement of the site and training of local personnel. The present economic and social situation has caused a serious decline in funding. But minimum and regular maintenance is being ensured by the national institute, ISPAN. Legal protection and management should be improved. Consolidation of the Sans Souci Palace and the rehabilitation of the Royal Gardens is required. \n The Committee commended the Regional Project for the pioneer role in setting up this regional monitoring programme and the involvement of regional structures and experts. Several delegates expressed their interest in similar programmes being initiated in other regions, particularly Africa and Asia, drawing upon the experiences in Latin America. The Committee took note that the regional monitoring programme would be concluded in 1994 with the publication of a regional state of conservation report. \n &nbsp;
