The Observer of China expressed her Government\'s appreciation for the grant from the World Heritage Fund for carrying out this activity. \n \n \n \n \n B.2.1.3 \n \n \n Colombia, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Panama \n \n \n Training \n \n \n Training in underwater archaeology \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n The Committee did not approve this request.&nbsp; It took note of the advisory bodies\' comments: ICCROM, although supporting the initiative of the States Parties, suggested reformulation of the request to strengthen the component of conservation within the programme.&nbsp; ICOMOS, stating that neither the specialized ICOMOS Underwater Cultural Heritage Committee nor ICOMOS had been consulted on the formulation of this request, stressed that emphasis should be placed on conservation if this activity was to be funded under the World Heritage Fund, as part of the implementation of the World Heritage Convention.&nbsp; The Committee requested the States Parties to reformulate the request, so that the project proposed was directly relevant to the implementation of the World Heritage Convention.&nbsp; Furthermore, it encouraged the State Party to utilize the network of existing international organizations and institutions specializing in underwater heritage conservation, and to consider the possibility of extending the target audience quantitatively and geographically.&nbsp; The Committee took note that the United States of America had announced that, if requested, it could make available the specialized expertise for underwater heritage protection from the relevant USA authorities and the National Park Service.&nbsp; The Committee noted that there was a draft UNESCO Convention for the Protection of Underwater Heritage. \n \n \n \n \n B.2.1.4 \n \n \n Lebanon \n \n \n Training \n \n \n Training Programme of Conservators-Restorers in the field of Mural Paintings at the World Heritage sites of Lebanon \n \n \n  60,000  \n \n \n The Committee requested the State Party to conduct the activity at a sub-regional level, including participants from the Syrian Arab Republic and Jordan. \n \n \n \n \n B.2.1.5 \n \n \n Russia \n \n \n Training \n \n \n International training workshop for World Heritage cultural site managers from Eastern and Central Europe \n \n \n  40,000  \n \n \n The Committee approved US$ 40,000, subject to the agreement by the State Party to co-operate closely with ICCROM for developing the curriculum and widening the scope of themes to be addressed, to include new modules of conservation management. \n \n \n \n \n  Cultural Heritage  \n \n \n  Sub-total  \n \n \n  Training  \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n  184,900  \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n \n \n B.2.2.1 \n \n \n Brazil \n \n \n Technical \n Co-operation \n \n \n Restoration of the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus de Congonhas \n \n \n  32,574  \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n B.2.2.2 \n \n \n Cuba \n &nbsp; \n \n \n Technical Co-operation \n \n \n Rescue and preservation activities of La Estrella Fortress and of Smith (Gramma) Key at the San Pedro de la Roca Castle, Santiago de Cuba \n \n \n  50,000  \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n B.2.2.3 \n \n \n Egypt \n \n \n Technical Co-operation \n \n \n Rehabilitation programme for Islamic Cairo \n \n \n  120,000  \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n The Committee approved  US$ 120,000 , stressing that this approval was an exceptional case. The Committee requested the State Party to submit a full report on the implementation of this activity after one year, for presentation to the 23 rd  Session of the Committee. Although fully supportive of the initiatives taken by the Egyptian authorities, a few Committee members questioned whether such a large grant should be approved, in view of the limited resources available from the World Heritage Fund. Furthermore, a member of the Committee expressed his concern, as a matter of principle, whether the Committee should commit itself to partially funding such a large project for a three-year period. \n However, the Delegate of Morocco, supported by other Committee members, stressed that Islamic Cairo was one of the most endangered World Heritage sites, and taking into consideration previous grants to Egypt for protecting its heritage sites, the Committee should continue to aid this State Party for rehabilitating Islamic Cairo. The Committee decided to approve US$ 120,000 for the first year of the project, underlining that this was an exceptional case in view of the State Party\'s commitment to fund an equal amount of funds for the first year of activities, and the Committee further requested the State Party to submit a full report on the progress made in the implementation of this project to the 23 rd  Session of the Committee. \n &nbsp; \n The Observer of Egypt, thanking the Committee for the generous grant for the first year of activities, underlined the tremendous scale of the rehabilitation project for Islamic Cairo. He assured the Committee of his Government\'s commitment in implementing this hundreds of million dollar project, and stated that the technical assistance grant would represent a minimal portion within the total project budget. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Paragraph No. as presented in WHC-98/CONF.203/14Rev.  \n \n \n  Requesting   State   Party  \n \n \n  Type of   Assistance  \n \n \n  Description  \n \n \n  Amount   Approved  (US$)  \n \n \n  Comments/  \n  Observations/  \n  Conditions  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n B.2.2.4 \n \n \n Ghana \n \n \n Technical Co-operation \n \n \n Documentation research for Forts and Castles of Ghana \n \n \n  40,000  \n \n \n The Committee approved the request, considering the importance of documenting historical data and iconographic material for enhanced management and conservation of the Forts and Castles of Ghana.&nbsp; However, the Committee approved the grant, subject to the following conditions&nbsp;: \n (a)Terms of Reference for the international consultant explicitly including a preliminary mission to Ghana to develop proper policies for compilation, storage, handling and conservation of the collection, and; \n (b)The World Heritage Centre ascertaining that there are trained staff members at Ghana Monuments and Museums Board who would be assigned to the Documentation Centre. \n \n \n \n \n B.2.2.5 \n \n \n Peru \n \n \n Technical Co-operation \n \n \n Emergency measures at the Lines and Geoglyphes of Nasca and Pampas de Jumana \n \n \n  50,000  \n \n \n The Committee noted that the Peruvian authorities were evaluating the state of conservation of the site for possible nomination for inscription on the List of World Heritage in Danger. \n \n \n \n \n B.2.2.6 \n \n \n Philippines \n \n \n Technical Co-operation \n \n \n GIS for mapping the Rice Terraces of the Philippines, and for strengthening enhanced management. \n \n \n  50,000  \n \n \n The Committee approved US$ 50,000 for purchasing computer equipment and for partially funding the international expert fees.

He confirmed that the restoration works were being carried out with the best of intentions, and that the national authorities had recently increased the national budget for Hagia Sophia restoration work to US$ 700,000. \n \n \n \n \n  Cultural Heritage  \n \n \n &nbsp; Subtotal  \n \n \n  Technical Co-op.  \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n  422,574  \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Paragraph No. as presented in WHC-98/CONF.203/ 14Rev.  \n \n \n  Requesting   State   Party  \n \n \n  Type of   Assistance  \n \n \n  Description  \n \n \n  Amount Approved(US$)  \n \n \n  Comments/   Observations/   Conditions  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malta \n \n \n Emergency Assistance \n \n \n Urgent conservation work for Hagar Qim, Megalithic Temples \n \n \n  72,448. 75   \n \n \n The Committee approved an urgent emergency assistance request submitted by Malta. The Committee took note of the evaluations of ICOMOS and ICCROM for the emergency assistance request. The Committee appreciated the urgency to address the catastrophic nature of the collapse of Hagar Qim, and considered this request could be funded from the emergency reserve. The Committee approved US$  72,448. 75   for (a) conducting a preliminary endoscopic survey; (b) reconstruction of the collapsed portion of Hagar Qim; and (c) installing an adequate monitoring system and conducting studies for preparing a long-term protection plan. The Committee requested the UNESCO Equipment Unit to assist the Maltese authorities in procuring the necessary equipment. The Maltese Delegate expressed his Government\'s deep appreciation for the immediate action taken by the Committee. \n \n \n \n \n  Cultural Heritage  \n \n \n &nbsp; Subtotal  \n \n \n  Emergency Assistance  \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n  72,448. 75   \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n\n ICCROM \n \n \n \n \n  Paragraph No. as presented in WHC-98/CONF.203/ 14Rev.  \n \n \n  Description  \n \n \n  Amount   Requested  (US$)  \n \n \n  Comments/Observations/   Conditions  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ICCROM 1 \n \n \n AFRICA-2009 Conservation of immovable cultural heritage in Sub-Saharan Africa \n \n \n  100,000  \n \n \n The Committee noted that the AFRICA-2009 Programme is a joint initiative of the World Heritage Centre, ICCROM and CRATerre-EAG, launched in March 1998 in Abidjan, C&ocirc;te d\'Ivoire, with the endorsement of&nbsp; nine Sub-Saharan African States Parties. \n \n \n \n \n ICCROM 2 \n \n \n 2.1 PAT 99 - Second Pan-American Course on the Conservation and Management of Earthen Architectural and Archaeological Heritage; \n &nbsp; \n 2.2 ITUC Programme for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention - Second International ITUC Workshop \n \n \n  78,470  \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n  30,000  \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Paragraph No. as presented in WHC-98/CONF.203/14Rev.  \n \n \n  Description  \n \n \n  Amount   Requested  (US$)  \n \n \n  Comments/Observations/  \n  Conditions  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ICCROM 3 \n \n \n 3.1 Development of global training strategy in South East Asia \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n 3.2 Scientific Development of the World Heritage Convention - Reference manual of methodologies for assessing the state of conservation of World Heritage sites \n &nbsp; \n \n \n  25,000  \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n  8,000  \n &nbsp; \n &nbsp; \n \n \n 3.1&nbsp; The Committee approved  US$ 25,000,  requesting ICCROM to carry out a needs assessment, which would lead to the development of training curricula, which could be used (a) within university architecture and urban planning departments to teach future architects and urban planners the basics of heritage conservation; and (b) by heritage site-managers to introduce and train the inhabitants, owners, community and religious leaders, local administrators and other stakeholders of World Heritage cultural sites, on the scientific basis of heritage conservation and maintenance.&nbsp; The Committee recommended that ICCROM develop this strategy in South-East Asia, in close co-operation with the States Parties concerned, the World Heritage Centre and the UNESCO Regional Advisor for Culture in the Asia-Pacific. \n 3.2 IUCN welcomed the opportunity of using this activity to enhance co-operation between the three Advisory Bodies. IUCN, reiterated the need to tightly define the target audience for the manual and that it should be aimed to support the capacity of the States Parties, as well as to enhance the process of monitoring to strengthen the management of World Heritage sites. The Committee took note that the Bureau: (1) recommended that while strongly supporting this activity, consideration for translation of the final manual into several languages should be considered from the outset; and (2) for identifying the best procedure in producing such a manual, recommended approval of an initial  US$ 8,000  to hold a brainstorming session between the advisory bodies and the World Heritage Centre. Based upon the results of the first step, proposals could be made to the 23 rd  session of the Bureau for further funding to implement the second and third phases of this activity. \n \n \n \n \n ICCROM \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n  241,470  \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n \n \n &nbsp; \n  &nbsp;  \n  &nbsp;  \n  Cultural Heritage: Requests examined by the Bureau  \n \n \n \n \n  Paragraph No. as presented in WHC-98/CONF.203/14Rev.  \n \n \n  Requesting   State   Party  \n \n \n  Type of   Assistance  \n \n \n  Description  \n \n \n  Amount Approved(US$)  \n \n \n  Comments/   Observations/   Conditions  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n B.1.1.1 \n \n \n Argentina \n \n \n Training \n \n \n Support for a Master Programme in Conservation of Heritage \n \n \n  25,000  \n \n \n The Bureau decided that US$ 3,000 for promotional material would not be granted in view of the limited funds available. ICCROM advised that the Committee and Bureau address the issue of recurring requests for training assistance. \n &nbsp; \n ICCROM stressed that this request, as with others coming from post-graduate conservation programmes on a continuing basis, raises questions which may demand policy clarification on the Committee\'s part. With the number of training requests now far in excess of support funds, and with over 100 such post-graduate programmes in place in the world, it is clear that the Committee\'s training funds cannot be permanently committed to support operations for only a small number of these programmes. The global training strategy meeting held in Rome on 16-17 November proposes a set of criteria by which to guide future assessments of training requests. ICCROM proposes an early review of the recommendations emerging from this meeting, in order to be able to present these criteria to the Bureau meeting of June 1999.&nbsp; With formal consensus built around such training assistance evaluation criteria, it should be possible to ensure allocation of available funds to highest impact/highest priority programmes. \n \n \n \n \n B.1.1.2 \n \n \n Cuba \n \n \n Training \n \n \n Training for preventive conservation \n \n \n  30,000  \n \n \n The Bureau decided to set aside the US$ 30,000 under the training assistance budget, in anticipation of the submission by the Cuban authorities of a reformulated request, until the 23 rd  Session of the Bureau. The Cuban authorities and ICCROM agreed to cooperate to reformulate the request, following the decision of the Bureau. \n \n \n \n \n  Cultural heritage  \n \n \n  Subtotal  \n \n \n  Training  \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n  55,000  \n \n \n  &nbsp;  \n \n \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n  Paragraph No. as presented in WHC-98/CONF.203/ 14Rev.  \n \n \n  Requesting   State   Party  \n \n \n  Type of   Assistance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   \n \n \n  Description  \n \n \n  Amount Approved(US$)  \n \n \n  Comments/   Observations/   Conditions  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n B.1.2.1 \n \n \n Bulgaria \n \n \n Technical Co-operation \n \n \n Technical Equipment for Monitoring Boyana Church \n \n \n  20,650  \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n B.1.2.2 \n \n \n Cuba \n \n \n Technical Co-operation \n \n \n Conservation and management of Morro-Cabana in Havana \n \n \n  28,777  \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n \n \n B.1.2.3 \n \n \n Kenya \n \n \n Technical Co-operation \n \n \n Establishment of national cultural sites database and GIS facilities \n \n \n &nbsp; \n \n \n The Bureau did not approve this request.&nbsp; It requested the State Party to pay its dues to the World Heritage Fund, and thereafter submit a request for preparatory assistance to prepare nominations for submission to the World Heritage Committee.

Thanking the Secretariat for its excellent work in developing this project, the Observer of Turkey underlined that this grant would have a multiplier effect ("seed money"), to stimulate general interest in conservation, as prioritized by the Committee in paragraph 109 of the  Operation Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention . Finally, the Observer of Turkey requested that Annex A to the Working Document WHC-98/CONF.203/14Rev, be updated and attached to the report of the twenty-second session of the World Heritage Committee, including the statement made by Professor F.
