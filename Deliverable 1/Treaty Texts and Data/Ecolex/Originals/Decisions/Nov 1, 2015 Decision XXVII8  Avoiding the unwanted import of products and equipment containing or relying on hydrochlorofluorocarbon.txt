Noting with appreciation  the historical role of decision X/9, on the Establishment of a list of countries that do not manufacture for domestic use and do not wish to import products and equipment whose continuing functioning relies on Annex A and Annex B substances, adopted by the Tenth Meeting of the Parties in November 1998, in limiting the use and furthering the phase-out of substances specified in Annex A and Annex B to the Montreal Protocol during the implementation of country programmes on phasing out chlorofluorocarbons and halons,    Taking into consideration  that decision X/9 covers only the substances specified in Annex A and Annex B to the Montreal Protocol,    Bearing in mind  that during the implementation of country programmes on phasing out hydrochlorofluorocarbons parties may take advantage of the positive experience of implementation of the main provisions of decision X/9, particularly in developing countries, by introducing bans or restrictions on the import of products and equipment containing or relying on substances specified in Annex C to the Montreal Protocol (hydrochlorofluorocarbons),    Taking into consideration  that some parties have already introduced bans or restrictions on the import of products and equipment containing or relying on hydrochlorofluorocarbons and therefore wish to inform exporting countries of that fact through existing mechanisms under the Montreal Protocol,   1. To invite those parties that do not permit the importation of products and equipment containing or relying on hydrochlorofluorocarbons from any source to inform the Secretariat, on a voluntary basis, if they so choose, that they do not consent to the importation of such products and equipment;   2. To request the Secretariat to maintain a list of parties that do not want to receive products and equipment containing or relying on hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which shall be distributed to all parties by the Secretariat and updated on an annual basis;
