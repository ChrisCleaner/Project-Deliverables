The Secretariat received a report indicating that an out-dated incinerator banned in many countries is being installed in a location 6.6 km from the Pulgulksa Temple.&nbsp; According to this report, the average emission rate of 0.92 ng per cubic metre of dioxin produced by this type of incinerator would have a negative impact on the community surrounding the Temple. \n The Delegate of the Republic of Korea informed the Bureau that although the City of Kyongju was implementing the construction of the incinerator, due to strong opposition from the local communities, the project had been temporarily halted. However, in view of the existing possibility of the construction of the incinerator, which could have a negative impact, he expressed his support for the Secretariat&rsquo;s recommendation to the Bureau. \n The Bureau, having been informed of a report of the potential negative environmental impact the installation of the incinerator may have on the surroundings of the Pulgulksa Temple, requested the State Party to provide a scientific report to the Secretariat by 15 September 1999 for examination by the Bureau at its twenty-third extraordinary session.
