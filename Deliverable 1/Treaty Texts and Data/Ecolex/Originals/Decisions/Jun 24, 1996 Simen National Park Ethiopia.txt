The Centre and IUCN have received a report on a Field Study on the flora and fauna of the Simen Mountains prepared by the University of Berne (Switzerland). The report indicates a deterioration of the Walia ibex population and that other large mammals (such as bushbuck and bushpig) have become extremely rare. In addition, IUCN stressed the serious situation at the ite, including the loss of biodiversity, the encroachment at the borders of the site, and the impacts of the road construction. An Action Plan for the site was proposed by the University of Berne. The report of the University of Berne was made available to the Bureau members and the following three main recommendations of this report were endorsed by the Bureau: \n 1)&nbsp;Support a planning and coordination meeting at the regional level, involving major stakeholders of the Simen Park area, with the general objective to update management planning of the Park and its buffer zone. \n 2) Organize a technical mission by the World Heritage Centre in the near future, i.e. September/October 1996, with the objective of assisting in the formulation of a possible submission to the Centre for technical assistance for (1) above. \n 3) Within the World Heritage Centre\'s mandate for better monitoring of African conservation sites, provide financial support for the finalization of the recent Simen Mountains Baseline Studies carried out in 1994-96, in order to make available to all stakeholders the informatioon collected in the studies for the above planning meeting.
