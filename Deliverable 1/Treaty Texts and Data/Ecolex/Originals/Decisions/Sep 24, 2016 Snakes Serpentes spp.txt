Parties are invited to consider undertaking the following actions: a) range States, importing countries, and other Parties to conduct more detailed assessments of those species indicated in Table 1 of document AC28 Doc. 14.3, for which available information suggests that international trade is \xe2\x80\x9clikely to be a threat\xe2\x80\x9d (four species) or \xe2\x80\x9cmay be a threat\xe2\x80\x9d (29 species); b) range States: i) to submit listing proposals for the four species categorized as \xe2\x80\x9clikely to be threatened by trade\xe2\x80\x9d and for the three species categorized as \xe2\x80\x9cmay be threatened by trade\xe2\x80\x9d and have an IUCN status (CR, EN, VU), including: Euprepiophis perlacea, Enhydris longicauda, and Cryptelytrops rubeus; and ii) to consider including the remaining species categorized as \xe2\x80\x9cmay be threatened by trade\xe2\x80\x9d in the Appendices; c) range States of Popeia buniana (Malaysia), Popeia nebularis (Malaysia), Cryptelytrops kanburiensis (Thailand and probably Myanmar) and Orthriophis moellendorfi (China and Viet Nam): i) to assess whether existing legislation, protected areas and current levels of trade are compatible with the conservation of these species in the wild; and ii) to evaluate the possible listing of these species under CITES (including Appendix III); d) Parties and range States: i) to compile more information on the exploitation levels (i.e. direct harvest and as by-catch) of freshwater and marine aquatic snakes subject to high volumes of international trade, including all species of Elapidae (Hydrophis spp., Kerilia spp., Lapemis spp., Laticauda spp., Thalassophina spp.) and Homalopsidae (Enhydris spp., Erpeton spp., Homalopsis spp.) indicated in Table 1 of document AC28 Doc. 14.3; and ii) to evaluate the possible listing of these species under CITES (including Appendix III); e) exporting countries and other Parties to put in place precautionary management measures, such as establishing closed areas or seasons, daily seasonal catch quotas, restricting the use of certain types of fishing gear or imposing size-limits, and improved domestic monitoring and reporting mechanisms for aquatic (freshwater and marine) snakes, including all Elapidae and Homalopsidae species indicated in Table 1 of document AC28 Doc. 14.3; and f) Parties to encourage research to improve the understanding of the ecology, biology and conservation of Asian snakes, inter alia through supporting relevant scientific institutions and promoting additional field studies.
