Royal   Chitwan National Park (Nepal)  \n On the basis of a detailed report provided by the IUCN Office in Nepal, a state of conservation report on this site was presented. A number of threats were noted including poaching of the rhinoceros and tiger populations in the Park. It was further noted that the 1976 Management Plan does not address many of the current management issues and thus urgently requires updating. The new legislation providing for a buffer zone around the Park is, however, a commendable step and should be implemented as soon as possible. The Committee requested the Centre to contact the appropriate authorities to encourage them to continue the process underway with regard to the buffer zone concept and to begin the preparation of a new Management Plan. \n &nbsp;
