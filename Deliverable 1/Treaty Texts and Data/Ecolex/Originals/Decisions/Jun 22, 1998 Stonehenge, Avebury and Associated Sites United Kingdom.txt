The Bureau expressed its satisfaction with the management and presentation proposals for the Stonehenge World Heritage site. It stressed, however, the need for the closure of the road passing close to the monument, foreseen when the site was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1986 and for the completion of a management plan with the minimum delay.
